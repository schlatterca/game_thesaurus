These are the galaxies that can be
observed from this dome.

The numbers represent their distance
from the observatory. The bigger the
number, the greater the distance.

The more {PS} Power Stars you find,
the farther you will be able to travel.
———————————————
Yes, it's undeniable! We're detecting
{PS} Power Star energy patterns in the
nearest galaxy.

But I must warn you that the evil
energy readings are off the charts!
Please be careful...
———————————————
Well done, brave explorer! You've
discovered a new galaxy!

Collecting {PS} Power Stars will expand
our range of vision, perhaps to
eventually include the enemy base...
———————————————
We have discovered an enemy base in
the region!

We can only hope they are not
misusing the power of that poor
{GS} Grand Star...
———————————————
Enemy base spotted! We're detecting
massive energy spikes! What ARE
they doing there?
———————————————
Aim for a {PLS} Pull Star with {P1},
then press {A} to fly to it!
———————————————
Please aim at me with {P1}, then
press {B} to feed me {SB} Star Bits!
———————————————
Those {SB}s are Star Bits. To Lumas,
they are the tastiest, most delectable
treats imaginable.

Aim your {WM} at the screen, and point
your {P1} at them to pick them up.

Once you have some, shoot them by
aiming with {P1} and pressing {B}.
———————————————
Why don't we try it out? Aim at me,
and feed me some {SB} Star Bits.
———————————————
Mmmm, tasty! Let's call those little
morsels my fee for this lesson.
———————————————
You can also shoot them at enemies
or feed them to a hungry Luma.

Either way, I am sure {SB} Star Bits
will be a big help on your adventure!
———————————————
That's the ticket!
———————————————
Yuuuum!
———————————————
Delicious!
———————————————
Oh, thank you! Yes!
———————————————
We have discovered the enemy's
forward base! I have a really bad
feeling about this...
———————————————
Welcome! This dome acts as an eye
of the observatory. From here, we
can gaze upon distant galaxies.

Once this Luma transforms into a {PLS}
Pull Star, he will guide you to those
faraway galaxies.

Simply point your {P1} at the {PLS} Pull
Star, and press {A}.
———————————————
Please allow me to guide you. Point
your {P1} at the {PLS} Pull Star, and
press {A}.
———————————————
Please point your {P1} at the {PLS} Pull

You rescued a {PS} Green Power Star!
These stars have a special power.
———————————————
Ask the Green Lumas about them.
After all, they will transform into
{PS} Green Power Stars someday!
———————————————
You've managed to recover all of the
{PS} Green Power Stars and restore
the {LS} Green Launch Star!
———————————————
Even I don't know what's waiting for
you out there beyond the
{LS} Green Launch Star.

I implore you, please help them!
———————————————
The beacon is lit again!

It shines weakly, maybe only as bright
as a Class 6 star, but at least the
poor Lumas will survive now.
———————————————
If we do that, we'll be able to restore
the Comet Observatory's ability to
fly like a starship.

Then perhaps we can pursue the
thieves who ran off with the
{PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
Would you like to see the map?
Here you go.
———————————————
Oh! The power is on in a new dome!
———————————————
The newly opened dome is called the
Fountain. It's really quite relaxing.

By the way, have you looked at the
map? It contains information about
galaxies as well as domes.

If you forget the location of a dome,
don't hesitate to speak with me.
———————————————
If you have trouble locating a dome,
please come see me.
———————————————
This map shows not only the positions
of the domes, but also the galaxies
you've found.

You will also be able to observe any
unusual space conditions. It's really
quite a marvel!
———————————————
Don't forget to come see me if you
get lost.
———————————————
Mario/Luigi! Somehow we made it too!
We'll help you get the Power Stars
and save Princess Peach!

You can count on us, Mario/Luigi! We're
all in this together.
———————————————
Leave it to us!
———————————————
We've finished building the
Starshroom starship. We'll use it to
search for {PS} Power Stars!

And we, the members of the Toad
Brigade, will be the brave crew!

And this brigade needs a bold leader,
so I nominate...um...well...me!

Under my command, the galaxies will
see the bravery of the Toad Brigade!
———————————————
See you around
the galaxies!
———————————————
The observatory has gotten brighter,
and there are more places we can go!

Things are bound to get busier now.
———————————————
We're SO busy!
———————————————
We've made sure {Luigi} Luigi is safe!
———————————————
We're taking good care of
{Luigi} Luigi for you!
———————————————
The Toad Brigade is showing signs of
fatigue. So we're gonna take it easy
for a bit...
———————————————
Things aren't great lately,
but they could be worse.
———————————————
The beacon is burning so brightly
because we've gathered so many
{PS} Power Stars!
———————————————
Beacon...so bright. My EYES!
———————————————
Mario/Luigi! So you've found the last
{GS} Grand Star? Now all you have to
do is track down Bowser!
———————————————
Just you wait, Bowser!
———————————————
Time's up, Bowser! The fearsome
leader of the Toad Brigade is coming
for you!

Oh...aghh...ouch? I think I feel a...
headache? Or maybe...I'm coming
down with...sniffle...the flu?

Go on without me! I'd only...uh...slow
you down. It's up to you to take the
fight to Bowser, Mario/Luigi!
———————————————
I have a headache. Yowie.
———————————————
So I guess this place is some kind of
mobile space station controlled by
that Rosalina lady.

But who exactly is she, anyway?
She's not a...witch? Is she?! IS SHE?!
Noooo...that's ridiculous. Right?
———————————————
Who is that Rosalina lady?
———————————————
You got a {GS} Grand Star from
Bowser Jr.'s robot?! So that means
Rosalina and Bowser are enemies.

Well, we have to help Rosalina and
find out where Bowser is hiding!
———————————————
So Bowser and Rosalina are enemies...
Let's get her to help us!
———————————————
Rosalina says strange stuff is going
on in areas you've already visited!
———————————————
What in the universe
is going on...
———————————————
If you get a {GS} Grand Star and
restore some of the observatory's
energy, a dome will open...

It allows us to observe new galaxies
and look for more {PS} Power Stars.

Then you can use the dome's vision
to peer into space and maybe
find Bowser's whereabouts!
———————————————
Get another {GS} Grand Star to be able
to see more of the universe. Then we
can visit more galaxies!
———————————————
Now {Luigi} Luigi will help you look for
Power Stars, too!

That'll help! Just talk to the {Luigi} man
himself!
———————————————
Now {Luigi} Luigi will help look for Power
Stars too! That'll help. After all, he's
{Mario} Mario's {Luigi} brother!
———————————————
Let's work with {Luigi} Luigi!
———————————————
Bowser is collecting {PS} Power Stars
to become the king of the universe!

We can't let that happen!
———————————————
Argh... Bowser!
———————————————
Now that you've recovered a few
{GS} Grand Stars, it's gotten a lot
brighter in here!

I bet you can go to the top floor now.
———————————————
Have you been up to the
top floor of this place?
———————————————
Looks like we need a few more
{PS} Power Stars to find Bowser.

Go back to some galaxies you've
already been to and look for any
{PS} Power Stars you missed!
———————————————
Check out earlier galaxies for missed
{PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
The observatory has power again, and
Bowser's hideout has been found!

Mario/Luigi... Please save Princess
Peach and the universe!
———————————————
Please save Princess
Peach and the universe!
———————————————
Where are we? I want to go home...

I'm so homesick...

———————————————
The Lumas are going to build us a
ship! When it's done, let's go look for
Princess Peach and {PS} Power Stars!
———————————————
What kind of starship will it
be? Augh! I can't wait! ♪
———————————————
The Lumas built a mushroom starship
that looks just like us!
———————————————
The Starshroom is
fully operational!
———————————————
I've heard there are galaxies hidden
from view in all the observatory
domes! But how do you visit them?
———————————————
Galaxies you can't see in domes...
How're you supposed to get to them?
———————————————
A rare Luma has come to visit!

Something is different about it.
It has mysterious powers!
———————————————
I sense that the Luma over there...has
some kind of mysterious powers!
———————————————
Huh? What are those Lumas even
talking about?

Trial? Restoring the door? Maybe it
has something to do with galaxies
you can't see in domes?
———————————————
I wonder if those Lumas are
connected to hidden galaxies.
———————————————
The Lumas are gonna lead you to the
hidden Trial Galaxies!

But we can't go out there with
the Starshroom. You'll have to carry
on without us, Mario/Luigi!
———————————————
The Trial Galaxies are too far away
to reach, even with our starship.
Carry on without us, Mario/Luigi!

Howdy, Mario/Luigi! If you're looking for

has to say in the back!

Mr. Maaario/Mr. Luiiiigiii! Mailtoad here! Just you

Gotta keep looking for those
{PS} Power Stars!
———————————————
Whew... I am...beat... You'll have to
find the rest of the {PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
Good luck searching for
{PS} Power Stars!
———————————————
You should go to the Terrace first.

Please rescue the {PS} Power Stars in
the galaxies you see there.
———————————————
That ball of flame represents the
power of the observatory. We call it
the beacon.

When you recover a {GS} Grand Star,
a little {PS} Star Power will be
restored, and the beacon will grow.
———————————————
If the beacon's power grows enough,
this ship will be able to fly to the
center of the universe.

It looks like your friends are going to
give you a hand.

You should get started by rescuing
the {PS} Power Stars in the
galaxies you can see from the domes.
———————————————
The Comet Observatory can use that
power to fly through the universe.
———————————————
Once all of the power is restored,
we will even be able to fly to the
center of the universe...
———————————————
It seems that a Prankster Comet has
appeared somewhere...
———————————————
Prankster Comets have very strange
effects on galaxies.

If you want to learn more about
these exotic comets, ask the purple
Luma over there.
———————————————
Prankster Comets have very strange
effects on galaxies.

If you want to learn more about
these curious comets, ask the Luma
who knows about such things.
———————————————
You rescued another {GS} Grand Star,
and power has returned to another
dome in the back of the observatory!

Hmmm, but I still don't think we have
the {PS} Star Power we need to fly
the observatory through the universe.
———————————————
The villain who kidnapped your
special one took her far from here,
to the center of the universe.
———————————————
Once our {PS} Star Power is restored,
the observatory will be able to go
there.

Then you can reunite with your
special one...
———————————————
Once our {PS} Star Power is restored,
the observatory will be able to travel
to the center of the universe.

Please go to the domes in the back
and do your best to recover more
{PS} Star Power!
———————————————
Thanks to you and your friends, all of
the domes on the lower level are
working again.
———————————————
Once the Engine Room on the upper
level has power, the whole
observatory will be working.

Then the Comet Observatory will
fly as a starship once again.
———————————————
And you will be able to fly to your
special one in the center of the
universe...
———————————————
Once the Engine Room on the upper
level is powered on, this observatory
will function as a starship again.

Then you will be able to see your
special one in the center of the
universe...
———————————————
Welcome back...
———————————————
And I'm sure he has a lot to tell you.
You should go speak to him over
there by the Garage.
———————————————
I can see your {Luigi} brother from here.

If you ask him, I bet he'll help you
search for {PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
I can see your {Luigi} twin from here.

If you ask him, I bet he'll help you
search for {PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
We have ascertained the location of
your special one. Please take a look
at the circle by your feet.
———————————————
That number represents the {PS}
Power Stars you need to reach the
center of the universe.

That number will decrease with each
{PS} Power Star you recover.
———————————————
And when it reaches zero, the Comet
Observatory will regain full power
and fly as a starship again.

And then we will be able to reach the
center of the universe.
———————————————
The beacon is so bright now,
it's hard to look at!
———————————————
Once you recover the remaining
{PS} Power Stars, the observatory will
fly as a starship again.

Then we can lead you to your special
one in the center of the universe.
———————————————
When we recover the remaining {PS}
Power Stars, the number on the
platform will go down to zero.

Then the Comet Observatory will be
able to get you close to your
special one.
———————————————
Mario/Luigi... Your name is Mario/Luigi,
isn't it? That is what I heard from
your friends who just arrived.

Mario/Luigi... It has such a nice ring.
———————————————
Your friends are waiting for you in
the Garage.

I think they want to tell you
something, so you'd best hurry on
over there.
———————————————
Your friends are waiting for you in
the Garage.

I think they want to tell you
something, so please hurry there.
———————————————
Now that we've recovered so many
{GS} Grand Stars, the beacon is almost
too bright to look at.
———————————————
Once the observatory works as a
starship again, we can bring you to
the center of the universe!

Then we can get to your special
one. We just need a few more
{PS} Power Stars... You must help us!
———————————————
Oh, thank you for saving the Grand
Star. These star people are my
family... They mean so much to me.
———————————————
Welcome to the Comet Observatory.
It's my home, and also home to
the Lumas.
———————————————
Please, I have a request...
———————————————
This observatory uses {PS} Star Power
to project images of the galaxies
that are scattered across space.
———————————————
And...there is a chance we can use
our few remaining stars to look for
other {PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
Please go to the Terrace and try to
recover the {PS} Power Stars from the
galaxies you can see from there.
———————————————
These round rooms are called domes.
We observe galaxies from domes such
as these.

But the only one that is working now,
powered by the {PS} Star Power you
restored, is this one...the Terrace.
———————————————
It's time. Do you want to go to the
location of your special one at the
center of the universe?
———————————————
All right, then. Off we go!
———————————————
Please speak to me again when you
are ready.
———————————————
We now have enough {PS} Star Power
to go to another world.

But before that, we must help your
special one.
———————————————
Are you prepared to travel to the
center of the universe?
———————————————
The Comet Observatory has full
power! Now it can fly through
the cosmos again.
———————————————
Welcome back! I knew you would
return eventually.
———————————————
Please look down at your feet.

can just BLOW IT UP!

Oh! Take this as my thanks! I found it
lying around. Maybe it will help you.
———————————————
NO, NO! You gotta do it faster!

You know how hard it is keeping a
dreadnought clean?

And then someone comes and drops
a load of trash in the ammo depot!
———————————————
Gee, thanks!
———————————————
OK, then... If you need to leave, you
can use that pipe there.
———————————————
You blew that trash
to bits! Thanks!
———————————————
Heyyyy...we have plenty of bombs.
Maybe you could use them to blow
up all this trash?
———————————————
There's always more, so come by
again later if you feel like helping!
———————————————
Oh, hey! You want to blow up all this
trash for me?
———————————————
Who knew that bombs work so well
as an industrial-strength cleaner?
Thanks, I owe you big.

Oh, I know! Take this! I just found it
lying around. Maybe it will help!
———————————————
No, no! You gotta do it faster!

GARBAGE DUMP!

What, do people think they can just
toss their trash here and it'll
magically disappear?
———————————————
Gee, thanks!

OK. If you have to leave, you can use

To turn left, twist {WR} left from that
starting position.

to the right.
———————————————

it a go on the course!

First, jump to get on top of the ball.

Get on the ball!

All right, you're on! Now, hold {WR}
straight up.

Right, that's it! That's what we call
the basic position.
———————————————
From that basic position, tilt {WR} to
move the ball in that direction. Then
just press {A} to jump!

If anything gets in your way, smoosh
it! Anyway, you'll learn more by
doing it yourself. Good luck!

Please, you gotta run Guppy right
out of here!

———————————————
I just spotted Guppy in the
underground lake!
———————————————
Guppy... In the
underground lake...
———————————————
There's a {PS} Power Star in the
center of that watermelon, but I don't
know how to get it!

Hmmm... Maybe you could ground-
pound to knock a tennis ball into
the watermelon!
———————————————
That was great!
———————————————
Want to get those {PCoin} Purple Coins
out there? Break out the long jump!
———————————————
Hi there!
———————————————
Nope, I don't see any {PCoin} hidden in
the dirt.
———————————————
I've got a level one
snorkel-toad certification!
———————————————
Wow, what's a ghost ship doing here?
Scared? Don't worry, I'll protect you.

If any ghosts come out, I'll send them
running scared! Too bad I don't see
any ghosts.
———————————————
No ghosts here! Too bad you
don't get to see me in action.
———————————————
Aaaagh! A g-g-ghost!
———————————————
Did that ghost run away?
———————————————
Guppy is back again. I'm the leader,
so I'll deal with him!
———————————————
Guppy? You don't scare me...
———————————————
What, you again?

You got to be kiddin' me. You want to
run me out of this lake? You got to
get through all eight rings!
———————————————
All right, I'm a fish of
my word. Take this.
———————————————
You think you got the flippers to
challenge me? Think again!
———————————————
If you want to know about swimmin',
ask us penguins. We're friendly.
———————————————
You see the sparkly {YC} things?
———————————————
There was a {YC} sparkly
in the ocean.
———————————————
So... {SB} chunks, huh?
———————————————
Dive with {Z}!
———————————————
On the water's surface,
shake {WR} to jump!
———————————————
Press {A} repeatedly to do
a breaststroke!
———————————————
When you're on a swing, use {J} to
make it sway.
———————————————
There are five of those
{YC} sparklies in the sea.
———————————————
Want to swim faster?
Try spinning!
———————————————
Swim through bubbles to
get a gulp of air!
———————————————
The {YC} sparklies are ever
so pretty.
———————————————
Don't forget to get some
air using the bubbles!
———————————————
Yeah, this Beach Bowl is pretty much
penguin paradise!
———————————————
Welcome to Beach Bowl!
———————————————
Press and hold {A} to kick
your legs!
———————————————
Now taking applications for the Beach
Bowl Swim School's final swim test!
———————————————
Sign up for the final swim
test here!

———————————————
You takin' the test? Go find Coach!

———————————————
Your underwater speed with a
shell depends on its color.
———————————————
Do a spin to grab
a nearby shell.
———————————————
Use {Z} to slow down when
you're shell swimming.
———————————————
The key to the test is
getting the right shell.
———————————————
The test is to...steal
someone's shell!
———————————————
Shake {WR} to throw shells.
———————————————
If you want to graduate from the
swimming class with ease, ask my
friends for hints.
———————————————
Shake {WR} in the water to
get a burst of speed.
———————————————
Spin in the water to grab
nearby shells!
———————————————
Get out of the way!
———————————————
Use wall jumps to get
way up high!
———————————————
You know about shell swimmin'?
It's great! You see, the shell
does all the swimmin' for you!
———————————————
Shell swimmin' is so
much fun! Wheee!
———————————————
No swim class today!
———————————————
I heard the rock wall on the ocean
floor is ready to crumble!
———————————————
Grab a shell and get going!
———————————————
Break it with a shell?
———————————————
Have you learned to swim?
———————————————
When you've got a shell,
shake {WR} to throw it.
———————————————
We're thinkin' about how to bust down
the rock wall on the seafloor.
———————————————
You can snag nearby
shells by spinnin'.
———————————————
There's a cracked wall
deep down in the sea.
———————————————
Use {Z} to slow down while
you're shell swimming.
———————————————
You can break chests
with shells.
———————————————
Where's that cracked wall?
———————————————
Out of the way!
———————————————
You're in the way!
———————————————
Speed up!
———————————————
Shells are harder
than rocks!
———————————————
If you spin, you'll go
a little faster.
———————————————
Today's swim class is
independent study!
———————————————
If you want to gather {PCoin} Purple
Coins, listen closely to everyone.
———————————————
There are {PCoin} Purple Coins
in the ocean too.
———————————————
When you're swimmin' on the surface,
shake {WR} to jump.
———————————————
Use {+} to get a good
look around.
———————————————
Above the coach's
head...heh!
———————————————
When you grab a vine, use {J} to
swing around and {A} to leap!
———————————————
Check out the sweet view!
———————————————
If it's {PCoin} Purple Coins you're after,
there are five of them in the ocean.
———————————————
Oh, {PCoin} Purple Coins? I think there's
one up above the tallest palm tree.
———————————————
Grab a vine and spin {J}!
———————————————
If you look closely, there's
a crack here...
———————————————
WHOA! A CAVE!
———————————————
There are other students taking the
test right now, so it's going to turn
into a mad grab for the gold shell.
———————————————
Amazing! I didn't think you'd
actually be able to bring it back!

Well then, here's a big Gold Medal
for you!
———————————————
Nice job on the test! But...are you
even one of my students?
———————————————
Is that so? Well, come on by and visit
again sometime!
———————————————
In this test, you must collect shells in
the ocean!

If you bring me the gold shell, it's an
automatic A for you!
———————————————
You here to take the swimmin'
school's final swim test?
———————————————
The students are distracted by the
{YC} sparklies!
———————————————
Ah, {YC} sparklies!
———————————————
Don't hit the wall on the ocean floor
with a shell. It would break, and...
———————————————
Don't break the wall with a
shell, OK? I'm serious.
———————————————
It's free time in swim class today!
———————————————
Play nice, all right?
———————————————
I'm not giving this up!
———————————————
Awww... I got beat!
———————————————
Where is that thing?
———————————————
A gold shell! Wait!
———————————————
Not bad! Not bad at all!
———————————————
Don't get in my way!
———————————————
Spin to grab shells!
———————————————
Have you stopped by to
talk to Coach?
———————————————
Where's that thing?
———————————————
Spin to chase them!
———————————————
We failed the test.
———————————————
Aren't you taking the test?
———————————————
If you want to grab something up
high, spin after you jump! Boiyoing!
———————————————
Hi there! Good to see you!

I have some bad news, though. See, I
HAD a {LS} Launch Star all ready
for you, but a meteor smashed it up!

You can't leave without it, so find all
the {YC} Star Chips to fix it. Oh, and
be sure not to fall in the black hole!
———————————————
Where are all those
{YC} Star Chips?
———————————————
Yay! The {LS} Launch Star is ready to
go now! Spin to blast off!
———————————————
In trouble? Spin!
———————————————
Watch your step!
———————————————
We've been waiting for you!
———————————————
That's a {GS} Grand Star! We have to
save it!
———————————————
They're using the {GS} Grand Star to
power that awful machine. It looks
like it's making...something.
———————————————
We have to do something before the
{GS} Grand Star's power is drained!

Quick! Find a way to stop that
terrible machine!
———————————————
Please! Save the {GS} Grand
Star before it's too late!
———————————————
You did it! Now hurry and take the
{GS} Grand Star back to our mama!
———————————————
Take the {GS} Grand Star to
our mama!
———————————————
Turn off the flipswitches on the floor
to shut down this machine!
———————————————
Thank you! Now go save the
{GS} Grand Star!
———————————————
Hurry! The {GS} Grand Star!
———————————————
Spin enemies! Then run into them
when they're stunned to boot them!
———————————————
Hurry! Down here!
———————————————
If you take damage, grab a {Coin} coin
to boost your life!
———————————————
Grab a {Coin} coin to get
some health back!
———————————————
Finally, you're awake! Let's play.
———————————————
C'mon! Jump with {A}!
———————————————
Let's play hide-and-seek!

If you catch all of us, we'll tell you
about where you are.
———————————————
I've been watching you from here.
This place is called the gateway
to the starry sky...
———————————————
My name is Rosalina. I watch over
and protect the cosmos.

To save your special one, you'll need
the power to travel through space.
———————————————
Luma can give you this power. I will
entrust you with his care.
———————————————
Disaster has struck us, just as it
has visited you. With Luma, I hope
you can rescue the {GS} Grand Stars.

May the stars shine down on you...
———————————————
This planet...

It's very dear to me.
———————————————
I looked forward to visiting this
planet with the Lumas every one
hundred years...
———————————————
The Luma that's been traveling with
you may also grow up to become a
star someday.

Some Lumas become planets...some
become comets...and a few become
{PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
I'm traveling with them while they
look for a place to be reborn.
———————————————
But I never thought all this would
happen...
———————————————
Aw, if only I'd hidden in the pipe.
———————————————
I should've hidden in the grass.
———————————————
Mama's waiting up above. Please help
her with whatever she asks!
———————————————
Aw, I knew I should've hidden in
the crater.
———————————————
Sorry about bringing you here so
suddenly. We should probably tell
you where you are!

There's a connection here to deep
space, far from your lands. We call it
the gateway to the starry sky.
———————————————
Wow! You caught all of us? Maybe
you really can help Mama...
———————————————
You caught me!
———————————————
I can't believe I let myself get caught!
———————————————
Please do as Mama asks.
———————————————
There's a connection here to deep
space, far from your lands. We call it
the gateway to the starry sky.
———————————————
Shake {WR} to spin into things that
look breakable! You can even spin
enemies to stun them.
———————————————
Yes! That's it!
———————————————
This is a {LS} Launch Star. Shake {WR}
when you're near one to shoot
through space like a comet!

Now, go and explore the universe!
There are lots and lots of galaxies
for you to discover!
———————————————
Go on! Go up to the {LS} Launch Star
and shake {WR}!
———————————————
Wow... Mama must really trust you.

Well, how about this?
———————————————
If you grab all 100 {PCoin} Purple Coins
here, then you'll earn my trust too.
———————————————
Hmm... Not bad!
———————————————
This is a Red Star. It holds the
power of the Red Lumas.

But the really amazing part about it
is, it allows you to fly after you spin
in midair. Yes, FLY!

While pressing {A}, you can pick the
direction you want to fly with {J}.

If you can collect 100 {PCoin} Purple
Coins, I'll let you use my power
somewhere else.
———————————————
Thanks! Would you mind rescuing my
buddy in that base up there too?

I'll transform into a {LS} Sling Star.
Just jump into me after I...

TRANSFORM!
———————————————
Get me out of here! One of those
enemies should have the key!

You can shake {WR} to spin them
around and make them dizzy. Once
they're stunned, just run into them!
———————————————
Hey! My name is Bill Board! Say,
have we met somewhere before?

Anyway, you'll need to hop on that
ball to get through here. Once you're
on, hold up your {WR}!

Then tilt {WR} to move around and
press {A} to jump! Try not to fall in
any holes!
———————————————

———————————————
Grab on and climb up here.
It's a blast, no joke!
———————————————
One of the perks of being a bee is
that we can stick to this honey wall.
———————————————
My thanks! You have shown much
bravery, New Bee. We trust that we
may rely on you in the future!
———————————————
And who might you be? A physician,
we presume?

No matter. We are in the most vexing
predicament and require assistance.

The most furious itchiness plagues
our entire being! It must be stopped!
Please find the source at once!
———————————————
Yes, that's the ticket!
———————————————
Ah...that feels goooood! ♪
———————————————
Ahoo hoo! That tickles! ♪
———————————————
Can you get over this wall?
———————————————
That's it! To the skies!
———————————————
Don't sleep! You'll
catch a cold!
———————————————
Unnng, so tired...
———————————————
Frozen Peak! Ah, how nice!
———————————————
I l-l-looked in the water, but there
were no {PCoin} P-P-Purple Coins.
C-can't...remove...s-s-snorkel...
———————————————
The summit. It is always the pure
essence of challenge that burns in an
adventurer's heart.

Leaping from here will take all
the boldness you possess. You better
make sure it's a long jump.
———————————————
If you want to jump from here,
make sure it's a long jump.
———————————————
The water here is cold! Really, really
cold. Seriously! If you fall in, it's
going to hurt!
———————————————
Hey, old man! Are you practicing how
to skate too? Well, why don't we
play a game? Can you catch me?
———————————————
How could one penguin move
SO fast?! ♪
———————————————
Not bad, old man! With skating skills
like that, you might have a chance.
A small chance, maybe, but a chance!
———————————————
Let's race again sometime!
———————————————
The Sweet Sweet Galaxy/Sling Pod Galaxy/Drip Drop Galaxy/Bigmouth Galaxy/Sand Spiral Galaxy/Boo’s Boneyard Galaxy/Snow Cap Galaxy
has appeared!
———————————————
You transformed into Bee Mario/Luigi!
Hold {A} to buzz around.

You transformed into Fire Mario/Luigi!
Shake {WR} to shoot fireballs.

You transformed into Ice Mario/Luigi!
Shake {WR} to skate! You can walk on
water too!
———————————————
You transformed into Rainbow
Mario/Luigi! You're invincible!

Your health grew to 6! If it drops

You transformed into Boo Mario/Luigi!
Shake {WR} to vanish.

A new planet was born!

Dear {Player},
Oh, no! It's horrible!
Luigi has gone missing!
What will we do?!

Mailtoad
———————————————
Dear {Player},
Thank you for saving Luigi!
Keep trying to rescue those
Power Stars, and we'll do our
best to help! ♪

Mailtoad
———————————————
WHAT?! HOW...

Foolish Mario/Luigi... My plan is too far
along now! You really think you can
stop me?!

Bwahahaha!
———————————————
BWAHAHAHA!

You finally made it!
———————————————
Just in time for me to stomp you into
space bits!
———————————————
I can feel a {GS} Grand Star nearby!

But this place is filled with all kinds
of traps and tricks! Be careful!
———————————————
The gravity here is all out of whack!
Check out the arrows!
———————————————
BWAHAHAHA!

Not bad! I guess I chose the right guy
to be my archenemy. At least
you always put up a fight.

But it's too bad for you, because my
master plan is almost complete.
Tough luck, Mario/Luigi!
———————————————
WHAA--?! IT'S YOU!

That's it, Mario/Luigi! I'm gonna stomp
you into space bits!
———————————————
There are a bunch of traps here too!
Just be careful of the gravity.
———————————————
The dark matter is eating holes in
space! Watch out for those holes, or
you'll fall into that dark matter!
———————————————
Use the stairs here!
———————————————
Thanks a lot!
———————————————
Looking for Princess Peach? Too bad!
'Cause she's with me!
———————————————
Finally!

You got here just in time to see the
creation of my galaxy in the center
of the universe!

Watch and weep!
———————————————
From this galaxy, I'll rule a great
galactic empire with Peach by my
side. It will last forever!

I will rule every pitiful corner of
the universe.

So, Mario/Luigi, as you can see, I got big
plans. And stomping you is at the
top of my list!
———————————————
Mama says this fight isn't just
for us, it's also about saving
your special one.

Please be careful! Whatever you
do...DON'T FAIL!
———————————————
Those spotlights have their own
gravity. Try sticking to them!
———————————————
You just don't give up! Fine, then. I
guess I'll just whup you myself!

You want this {GS} Grand Star so bad?
You're gonna have to take it from me!
———————————————
Mario/Luigi! You finally made it! I was
starting to worry.

You're finally here...

The comet was so large one year, it
filled the skies and sent countless
shooting stars raining down.

The Toads brought the shooting stars
to the castle, where they became
a great Power Star.

It should have been a very happy

———————————————
Our story begins a very, very long
time ago with a young girl. One day,
this girl spotted a rusted spaceship
holding a small star child.
———————————————
"What's your name? Are you lost?"
the girl asked the star child.
———————————————
"I'm Luma, and I'm waiting for Mama.
She's coming for me on a comet!"
said the star child, who had been
waiting day and night.
———————————————
"Don't worry. I'll wait with you,"
the little girl promised Luma.
———————————————
At nightfall, the little girl borrowed
her father's telescope and peered
into the sky. She looked and looked,
but she saw nothing. Hours turned
into days and then years, but still
the sky revealed nothing.
———————————————
Finally, the little girl sighed and said
to Luma, "If we stay here looking
much longer, I'll be an old lady soon."

But then she had an idea.
———————————————
"Why don't we go out there and find
your mother ourselves?"
———————————————
The girl and Luma fixed up the rusty
spaceship, and then the two set sail
into the starry sky.

And this is how the search for the
celestial mother began.
———————————————
Chapter 1
-The Celestial Duo-
———————————————
Days passed with no sight of the
comet, or even a single planet.
Instead, asteroids extended for as
far as the eye could see.
———————————————
"If I had known it was going to take
this long, I would have packed more
jam," said the little girl, above the
rumble of her belly.
———————————————
Before they left, she had packed all
the essentials: telescope, butterfly
net, stuffed bunny, bread, milk, jam,
and apricot-flavored tea, but...
———————————————
"I forgot to bring water!"

At this, Luma burst into gales of
laughter, and the girl began to pout.
———————————————
"As long as I have Star Bits, I'll be
fine," said Luma. "Want some?"
The little girl couldn't stay mad
after hearing this.
———————————————
Luma continued to laugh, and the girl
couldn't help but join in.
———————————————
"All right, maybe just a nibble."
———————————————
Leaning far out of the ship, the pair
began to collect Star Bits with the
girl's net. They almost fell out a few
times, but they kept on collecting.
———————————————
The Star Bits tasted like honey.
———————————————
Chapter 2
-Star Bits-
———————————————
A beam of light pierced through the
ship's window. Thinking it was the
morning sun, the girl peered through
the window, only to find a turquoise
blue comet shimmering at her.
———————————————
The little girl shook the sleeping
Luma awake and shouted excitedly,
"We HAVE to get to that comet!"
———————————————
The pair descended on the comet
and found that it was made of ice.
They looked high and low, but Luma's
mother was nowhere to be found.
———————————————
Exhausted, the little girl sat down
with a flop, utterly unable to take
another step.

"Look!"
———————————————
Peering down at the icy ground
where Luma was pointing, the girl
suddenly noticed clusters of
Star Bits encased in the ice.

"Pretty good, huh? Finding Star Bits
is my specialty!" said Luma, beaming.
———————————————
"There's ice here, but it's so warm,
I'll bet there's water here too."

The two decided to stay on the
comet for a while.
———————————————
Riding the turquoise comet, the
pair continued their search for
Luma's mother.
———————————————
Chapter 3
-The Comet-
———————————————
One night, the girl dreamed about
her own mother.

"Where are you going?" she asked
her mother's retreating back.
———————————————
Without turning, her mother replied,
"Don't fret, dearest. I'm not going
anywhere. I'm always watching over
you, like the sun in the day and the
moon in the night."
———————————————
A wave of sadness washed over
the girl.

"What about when it rains, and I
can't see the sun or the moon?"

Her mother thought for a moment
before responding.
———————————————
"I will turn into a star in the clouds
and wait for your tears to dry."
———————————————
When she awoke, the girl's face was
damp with tears.

"You have Star Bits in your eyes!"
said Luma to the girl.
———————————————
Wiping her face, the girl replied,
"These are tears, not Star Bits. I'm
crying because I'll never see my
mother ever again!"

At this, Luma began to cry too.
"Mama, oh, Mama... Waaaah!"
———————————————
The pair traveled through the starry
skies, and though they encountered
many other comets, not one of them
held Luma's mother.

Luma was despondent.
———————————————
"Now, now, Luma. The rain clouds
won't go away if you keep crying,"
the girl said, giving Luma a squeeze.
"I'll give you a present if you stop."
———————————————
The girl closed her eyes and said
gently, "I'll take care of you."

With these words, she felt a small
spark in her heart.
———————————————
Chapter 4
-The Dream-
———————————————
"The kitchen will go here, and the
library will go over there," the girl
said busily to herself. "We'll put the
gate here."
———————————————
Ever since the girl took Luma under
her care, she'd been bustling about
at a feverish pace.

"It's a lot of work, but it's worth it
to make a happy home."
———————————————
It turned out that Star Bits weren't
the only things buried in the ice.
There were tools and furniture
unlike any they had ever seen, and
the girl used them to build a home.
———————————————
Looking at the completed house,
Luma remarked, "Don't you think it's
awfully big for just the two of us?"

With a library, bedroom, kitchen,
fountain, and gate, it was
certainly spacious, but still,
something seemed to be missing.
———————————————
"If only my father, brother, and
mother were here," the girl said
wistfully. Indeed, the house was
too large for its two small residents.
———————————————
That night, clutching her favorite
stuffed bunny close to her heart,
the girl fell asleep in the starship.
———————————————
Chapter 5
-Home-
———————————————
Then one day, while the girl sat
sipping tea, a tiny apricot-colored
planet appeared on the horizon.
———————————————
From the planet, another Luma of
the same color emerged.

"Do you two know each other?!"
the girl asked the two Lumas
gleefully. Despite the girl's
excitement, they seemed uneasy.
———————————————
The two Lumas neither drew closer
nor backed away from each other.
Instead, they just stared.

Then one Luma broke the silence.
———————————————
"My mama!"
———————————————
At once, the apricot Luma parroted
back, "My mama! My mama!"
———————————————
"My mama!" "My mama!"
———————————————
The two Lumas began to dance
around the girl frantically, and
neither showed any sign of stopping.
———————————————
The girl was so charmed by this
adorable scene that she couldn't
help but laugh.

And that's when something very
strange happened.
———————————————
Suddenly, more Lumas began to pop
out from the apricot planet. They
were different colors, but they all
shouted the same thing.

"My mama!" "My mama!"
———————————————
The sight of all the shouting Lumas
only made the girl laugh harder.
"What am I going to do with all
these children?!"

The Lumas just stared blankly as
she doubled over laughing.
———————————————
"I guess we'll have to name each and
every one of you."
———————————————
Tomorrow, once she had finished
naming them all, she would begin
moving all the Lumas into the
new house.
———————————————
Chapter 6
-Friends-
———————————————
After seeing their 100th comet, a
sudden thought popped into the
girl's head: "I wonder if my home
planet is still as blue as it was."
———————————————
That's when she remembered her
father's telescope.
———————————————
Peeking into the telescope, a tiny
blue dot floated into sight. It was
smaller than a Star Bit.

"How strange... It's so far away, but
it feels so close."
———————————————
She twisted the knob of the
telescope, and the blue dot grew
until she could make out a grassy
hill dotted with flowers. It seemed
very familiar to her.
———————————————
Zooming even closer, a terrace on
the hill came into view.

"I used to go stargazing there when
I lived on my home planet."
———————————————
She remembered rubbing the sleep
out of her eyes as she followed her
father up that hill to look at
the stars...
———————————————
She remembered how she and her
brother would sled down that hill...
———————————————
She remembered having picnics
with her mother on that hill on
bright and windy days...
———————————————
And...
———————————————
"I want to go home! I want to go
home right now!"

The girl burst into tears, and the
Lumas didn't know what to do.
———————————————
"I want to go home! I want to go
back to my house by the hill! I want
to see my mother!"

The girl was shouting now, her face
wet with tears.
———————————————
"But I know she's not there! I knew
all along that she wasn't out there in
the sky! Because...because..."
———————————————
"She's sleeping under the tree
on the hill!"
———————————————
The girl's cries echoed through the
stars, and a hush fell over the area.
———————————————
Chapter 7
-The Telescope-
———————————————
Though usually quite cheery, one
day the girl became sad again.
Luma drew close and tried to
comfort her.

"Mama, you still have me!"
———————————————
"And don't be sad about your mama,
because she's a part of you! That
means she's always close by!"
———————————————
"It's like me. I love Star Bits because
they remind me of my mama."
———————————————
"No...no..." the girl said, unable
to stop the tears.
———————————————
A lonely look flickered across Luma's
face, but it was soon replaced by
a wide grin.

"I have an idea!"
———————————————
"I will transform into a comet, a
soaring comet that can carry you all
on this journey!"
———————————————
With that, Luma, trailing bands
of white, soared high into the sky
and just as quickly started to
plummet back down.
———————————————
KABOOM! KABLAM!

The ground shook, and a bright light
poured out of the crater that the
Luma had created.
———————————————
The bands of light twisted together
to form a comet tail.
———————————————
And then Luma emerged, reborn
as a comet.
———————————————
The girl could scarcely believe
her eyes.

"But...how?" she kept asking.
———————————————
"Our destiny as Lumas is to
transform into different things,"
said a red Luma who had suddenly
appeared. "Stars, comets, planets...
We can become all of these things!"
———————————————
"When I grow up, I want to become a
star that makes someone special
smile," said a green Luma.
———————————————
A blue Luma chimed in, "That Luma
turned into a real cutie of a comet,
didn't he!"
———————————————
All of the Lumas together said,
"No more crying, Mama!"
———————————————
"Thank you..." said the girl in a
whisper, and she pulled the Lumas
close and hugged them.
———————————————
From that day on, Star Bits no
longer fell from the girl's eyes.
———————————————
The comet set forth for the girl's
home planet, its long tail blazing
proudly behind it.
———————————————
Chapter 8
-The Wish-
———————————————
With its many Lumas and telescopes,
the comet was quite a sight to
behold. The girl and the Lumas were
proud to call it home.
———————————————
At a welcoming party for a new
Luma, the girl gathered everyone in
the kitchen and said in a louder
voice than usual...
———————————————
"All right, everyone! Let's make a
cake! A cake sprinkled with Star
Bits! Then it will be a star cake!"

The Lumas excitedly began to gather
the ingredients.
———————————————
As she watched the Lumas scurry
about, the girl smiled and thought to
herself, "This is my family now, and I
will stay with them until they're
ready to leave the nest. And when
they do leave, I'll see them off with
a smile."
———————————————
"Because that's what makes a
mother happiest."
———————————————
That night, when the girl lay down
to sleep, a soft light enveloped her
and reminded her of the blue planet
she once called home.

"But it would be nice to return home
once every one hundred years to
nap in my favorite sleeping nook."
———————————————
The comet carrying the Lumas and
the girl continues on its journey to
this very day.
———————————————
With more "family members" in tow
than can be counted, it's said that
the comet visits the girl's home
planet once every hundred years, its
proud white tail glittering in the sky.

A strange force had latched on to
our ship, pulling away Star Bits and
our power source, {PS} Power Stars.
———————————————
Our ship had lost power, so it
entered a deep hibernation state
in which it could not move.
———————————————
Those who took your special one
picked up the {PS} Power Stars...

And discovered the power to cross
the universe.

A brave brigade Toad went to search

He went off to that planet and hasn't
been seen since! You think he's OK?
———————————————
Mario/Luigi! My brigade boarded the
enemy fleet, and none have returned!

As captain, I would go save them
myself, but I'm much too busy at the
moment...and scared.
———————————————
Look, it's the enemy fleet... Yikes...
———————————————
Collect 100 {PCoin} Purple Coins to make

Good luck!

Around here, we surf on rays.
I'm serious. We call it ray surfing.
That's what we do.
———————————————
That cute little guy over there is
Ray!
———————————————
Ray surfing isn't so easy, so listen
to what Coach has to say.
———————————————
Hey! This is penguin paradise!
———————————————
Are you a surfer too?
———————————————
Oh, but this is your first time
ray surfing, right? Well then, let me
show you the ropes.
———————————————
I see... Well, if you change your mind,
let me know.
———————————————
{#}? Congratulations!
You deserve a Gold Medal!
———————————————
Heya. Back for some ray surfing?
Do you want to hear about how
to ride?
———————————————
OK, let's practice!
———————————————
Good luck.

You're an old pro at
ray surfing, right?

Nice!

You can adjust Ray's
speed with {A}!

You're incredible!
———————————————
Tilt {WR} to turn!

That must impress the
princesses!
———————————————
Now that's some
crazy skill!
———————————————
Don't forget how to control
Ray! That could end badly.
———————————————
Attaray! You did a good
job too, buddy!
———————————————
You again? Back for more ray
surfing? This course is a monster.
You sure you want to try?
———————————————
OK, you got three minutes to get
back here. Stay calm, and just enjoy
the surf.
———————————————
Come back and try anytime!
———————————————
Wow! A {#} race time!
NICE! That is not an easy time to get
on this course.

Well, hey, everyone wants to see you,
so drop in and say hello.
———————————————
{#}? Great work!
Try to do even better next time!
———————————————
Hmmm... Maybe that was a bit rough
for you. Why don't you practice and
come back later?
