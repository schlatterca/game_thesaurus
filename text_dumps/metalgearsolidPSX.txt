0x1fc: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island
0x24c: in Alaska's Fox Archipelago
0x278: was attacked and captured by Next-Generation Special Forces
0x2c8: being led by members of FOX-HOUND.
0x2fc: They're demanding that the government turn over the remains of Big Boss
0x358: and they say that if their demands are not met within 24 hours,
0x3ac: they'll launch a nuclear weapon.
0x3e0: You'll have two mission objectives.
0x414: First, you're to rescue DARPA chief, Donald Anderson
0x45c: and the President of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker.
0x49c: Both are being held as hostages.
0x4d0: Secondly,
0x4ec: you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability
0x544: to make a nuclear strike...
0x570: and stop them if they do.
0x59c: What's the insertion method?
0x5cc: We'll approach the disposal facility by sub.
0x60c: And then?
0x628: We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle).
0x670: After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it.
0x6b8: From there on you'll have to swim.
0x64495c: High Tech Special Forces Unit FOX-HOUND.
0x644998: Your former unit...
0x6449bc: ...and one that I was a commander of.
0x6449f4: So they're still around...
0x644a20: There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity.
0x644a7c: Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities.
0x644ac4: Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.
0x644b0c: Decoy Octopus, master of disguise.
0x644b40: Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman.
0x7a8120: And Revolver Ocelot,
0x7a8148: specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter.
0x7a8194: And finally, in charge of them... FOX-HOUND's squad leader,
0x7a81e4: Liquid Snake.
0x7a8204: Liquid Snake?
0x7a8224: The man with the same code name as you.
0x7a8260: The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island.
0x7a82b0: I'll instruct you by codec after you reach your target.
0x7a82fc: Anyone going with me?
0x7a8324: As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.
0x7a8368: Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?
0x7a83ac: Yes.
0x7a83c4: This is a top-secret black op.
0x7a83f4: Don't expect any official support.
0xa1f934: Stay alert!
0xa1f950: He'll be through here... I know it.
0xa1f988: I'm going to swat down a couple of bothersome flies.
0x10e79d4: A Hind D?
0x10e79f0: Colonel,
0x10e7a0c: what's a Russian gunship doing here?
0x10e7a44: I have no idea...
0x10e7a68: but it looks like our little diversion got their attention.
0x10e7ab8: Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed!
0x13d20e4: Were the all SOCOM pistols|unloaded?
0x13d211c: Yeah. But there was a problem.
0x13d214c: What is it?
0x13d2168: The security on the door was broken.
0x13d21a0: So the door is still open? 2nd floor where?
0x13d21e0: The east side room.
0x13d2204: We'd better fix it before the Boss finds out...
0x14a18e4: But that's nothing.
0x14a1908: I heard they spotted an intruder outside.
0x14a1944: Really!?
0x14a1960: Maybe we'll finally get to see some action...
0x14a19a0: Yeah, but we'd better do something about that door.
0x14a19e8: Let's put in an order to have it repaired.
0x1546120: I moved the DARPA Chief to the cell in the 1st floor basement.
0x1546170: What about the vent shaft cleaning?
0x15461a4: They just opened the vent covers.
0x15461d8: They're about to start spraying for rats.
0x1546214: 1st floor basement ventilation shaft...
0x154624c: Shut those covers as soon as they're done spraying.
0x1546294: Also, keep your eye on that woman in the cell.
0x15462d4: Don't get careless now.
0x15462fc: Woman in the cell?
0x1689120: Did something happen?
0x1689148: There's an intruder.
0x1689170: Really?
0x1689188: He's already done three people.
0x16891b8: He's killed three people?
0x16891e4: Yeah.
0x16891fc: They say he's using stealth too.
0x1689230: Stealth?
0x168924c: There's an intruder besides me?
0x168927c: Anyway, I want you to increase the security detail on the chief.
0x178b8e4: Who...who, who's that??
0x178b90c: I'm here to save you.
0x178b934: You're the DARPA chief, Donald Anderson, right?
0x178b978: You're here to save me, huh?
0x178b9a8: What's your outfit?
0x178b9cc: I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt.
0x178ba18: Really? 
0x178ba34: It's true...
0x178ba54: You don't look like one of them.
0x178ba88: In that case, hurry up and get me out of here.
0x178bac8: Slow down. Don't worry.
0x178baf0: First I want some information... about the terrorists.
0x178bb38: The terrorists?
0x178bb58: Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke?
0x178bb9c: What are you talking about?
0x178bbc8: The terrorists are threatening the White House.
0x178bc0c: They say if they don't accede to their demands,
0x178bc50: they'll launch a nuclear weapon.
0x178bc84: Sweet Jesus...
0x178bca4: Is it possible!?
0x178bcc8: ...It's possible.
0x178bcec: They...
0x178bd04: ...could launch a nuke.
0x178bd2c: How do they plan to launch?
0x178bd58: I thought this place was just for... 
0x178bd90: keeping the dismantled warheads.
0x178bdc4: They shouldn't have access to a missile...
0x178be00: What I'm about to tell you is classified information.
0x178be48: Okay?
0x178be60: We were conducting exercises with a new type of...
0x178bea4: experimental weapon.
0x178becc: A weapon that will change the world.
0x178bf04: What?
0x178bf1c: A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack...
0x178bf68: from any place on the face of the earth...
0x178bfa4: ...a nuclear equipped walking battle tank.
0x1c73880: Metal Gear!?
0x1c738a0: ...It can't be!
0x1c738c0: ...You knew!?
0x1c738e0: Metal Gear is one of the most secret black projects!
0x1c73928: How did you know that?
0x1c73950: We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.
0x1c7398c: So that's the reason you were here at this disposal site?
0x1c739d8: Why else would I come to a God forsaken place like this.
0x1c73a24: I had heard the Metal Gear project was scrapped.
0x1c73a68: On the contrary,
0x1c73a8c: it's grown into a huge joint project between ArmsTech and ourselves.
0x1c73ae4: We were going to use this exercise as raw data...
0x1c73b28: and then proceed to mass production.
0x1e128f8: If it hadn't been for the revolution...
0x1e12930: Revolution...?
0x1e12950: Rex has fallen into the hands of terrorists...
0x1e12990: Rex?
0x1e129a8: Metal Gear Rex.
0x1e129c8: The code name for the new Metal Gear prototype.
0x1e12a0c: They're probably already finished arming the warhead
0x1e12a54: they plan to use with Rex.
0x1e12a80: These guys are pros.
0x1e12aa8: They're all experienced in handling and equipping weapons.
0x1e12af4: Hey!
0x1e12b0c: Shut up in there willya!
0x1e12b38: But I thought that all nuclear warheads were equipped with
0x1e12b84: safety measures.
0x1e12ba8: Some kind of detonation code that you have to input...
0x1e12bf0: Oh, you mean PAL.
0x1e12c14: Yes, of course, there is a PAL.
0x1e12c44: It's set up so that you need to input two different passwords
0x1e12c94: in order to launch the device.
0x1e12cc4: There are two passwords?
0x1e12cf0: Yes.
0x1e12d08: Baker knows one, and I know one.
0x1e12d3c: Baker? The president of ArmsTech?
0x1e12d70: That's right.
0x1e12d90: Each of us needs to input our password
0x1e12dc8: or there can be no launch.
0x1e12df4: But...
0x1e12e0c: They found out my password.
0x1e12e38: You talked?
0x1e12e54: Psycho Mantis can read people's minds.
0x1e12e8c: You can't resist.
0x1e12eb0: Psycho Mantis?
0x1e12ed0: One of the members of FOX-HOUND. He has psychic powers.
0x1e12f1c: ...This is bad...
0x1e12f40: It's just a matter of time before they get Baker's too...
0x22fc90c: If they find out Baker's password...
0x22fc95c: They'll be able to launch a nuke anytime.
0x22fc998: But...there is a way to stop the launch.
0x22fc9d4: What?
0x22fc9ec: The card keys.
0x22fca0c: Card keys?
0x22fca28: They were designed by ArmsTech, the system developers,
0x22fca70: as an emergency override.
0x22fca9c: Even without the passwords, you can just insert the card keys
0x22fcaec: and engage the safety lock...
0x22fcb1c: And if I do that?
0x22fcb40: Yes.
0x22fcb58: You can stop the launch.
0x22fcb84: That card key...?
0x22fcba8: So, where are the keys?
0x22fcbd0: Baker should have them.
0x22fcbf8: Listen. You need three card keys.
0x22fcc2c: There are three different slots to put them in.
0x22fcc70: You need to insert a card into each one of them.
0x22fccb4: OK, three card keys.
0x22fccdc: Do you know where they might be keeping Baker?
0x22fcd1c: Somewhere in the 2nd floor basement.
0x22fcd54: 2nd floor basement?
0x22fcd78: I heard the guard say they moved him to an area...
0x22fcdbc: that has a lot of electronic jamming.
0x22fcdf4: Any other clues?
0x22fce18: Yes...they cemented over the entrances,
0x22fce54: but didn't have enough time to paint them.
0x22fce90: Why don't you look for the areas
0x22fcec4: where the walls are a different color?
0x22fcefc: Here, take this. It's my ID card.
0x22fcf30: It'll open any level one security door.
0x22fcf6c: It's called a PAN card.
0x22fcf94: It works together with your body's own electrical field.
0x22fcfe0: Personal Area Network, huh?
0x22fd00c: It transmits data using the salts in your body as the transmission medium.
0x22fd068: As you approach the door's security devices,
0x22fd0a8: they'll read the data stored in the card...
0x22fd0e8: And the doors will open automatically. Gotcha.
0x28380e4: OK. I'm gonna get you out of here.
0x2838118: Wait a minute.
0x2838138: What is it?
0x2838154: You...
0x283816c: haven't heard any other way to disarm the PAL, have you?
0x28381b8: From your bosses or anyone.
0x28381e4: No.
0x28381f8: Are you sure you haven't heard anything?
0x2838234: I just said no.
0x2838254: So, does the White House plan to give in to the terrorist's demands?
0x28382ac: That's their problem.
0x28382d4: It has nothing to do with my orders.
0x283830c: But... what about the Pentagon?
0x2838340: Pentagon?
0x283835c: ....Nnnnnnngggghhh!
0x2838380: What is it!?
0x28383a0: Ww...why?
0x28383bc: Uuuuuugggghhhh!!
0x28383e0: What's that!?
0x2838400: Hey! What happened!
0x2838424: Hmmm...
0x283843c: Dead...
0x2b67148: Don't move!
0x2b67164: So you killed the Chief. You bastard...!
0x2b671a0: Liquid!? No...you're not.
0x2b671cc: Don't move!!!
0x2b671ec: Is this the first time you ever pointed a gun at a person?
0x2b67238: Your hands are shaking.
0x2b67260: !!!
0x2b67274: Can you shoot me, rookie?
0x2b672a0: Careful, I'm no rookie!!
0x2b672cc: Liar! That nervous glance... that scared look in your eyes.
0x2b6731c: They're rookie's eyes if I ever saw them.
0x2b67358: You've never shot a person, am I right?
0x2b67394: You talk too much.
0x2b673b8: You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.
0x2b673fc: I told you I'm no rookie!!!
0x2b67428: You're not one of them, are you?
0x2b6745c: Open that door!
0x2b6747c: You've got a card, don't you?
0x2b674ac: Why?
0x2b674c4: So we can get the hell out of here.
0x2b674fc: Looks like we'll be a little delayed.
0x2b67534: What're you doing!?
0x2b67558: Don't think!
0x2b67578: Shoot!
0x2b68018: SJ_M-=.-
0x2f191c0: Don't move!
0x2f191dc: So you killed the Chief. You bastard...!
0x2f19218: Liquid!? No...you're not.
0x2f19244: Don't move!!!
0x2f19264: Is this the first time you ever pointed a gun at a person?
0x2f192b0: Your hands are shaking.
0x2f192d8: !!!
0x2f192ec: Can you shoot me, rookie?
0x2f19318: Careful, I'm no rookie!!
0x2f19344: Liar! That nervous glance... that scared look in your eyes.
0x2f19394: They're rookie's eyes if I ever saw them.
0x2f193d0: You've never shot a person, am I right?
0x2f1940c: You talk too much.
0x2f19430: You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie.
0x2f19474: I told you I'm no rookie!!!
0x2f194a0: You're not one of them, are you?
0x2f194d4: Open that door!
0x2f194f4: You've got a card, don't you?
0x2f19524: Why?
0x2f1953c: So we can get the hell out of here.
0x2f19574: Looks like we'll be a little delayed.
0x2f195ac: What're you doing!?
0x2f195d0: Don't think!
0x2f195f0: Shoot!
0x33158bc: Thanks for the help.
0x33158e4: Wait!
0x33158fc: Who are you!?
0x331c30b: 2$#B!#21# #
0x33b80e4: You fool!
0x33b8100: You've killed him!!
0x33b8124: I'm sorry, Sir.
0x33b8144: ...His mental shielding was very strong.
0x33b8180: I couldn't dive into his mind.
0x33b81b0: Now we'll never get that detonation code...
0x33b81f0: Boss, I have a good idea.
0x34b78d0: Uuufff!!
0x34b78ec: Damn...
0x34b7904: Good girl. Just like that...
0x36678e4: Am I too late?
0x3667904: Oooooo.....
0x3667920: Huhuuhuhuh...
0x3667940: He's alive...
0x3667960: You're the ArmsTech president, Kenneth Baker, right?
0x36679a8: Don't worry, I'm here to save you.
0x36679dc: Noooo! Don't touch it...
0x3667a20: Right. Touch that wire...
0x3667a4c: and the C4 will blow up along with the old man!
0x3667a90: So you're the one that the Boss keeps talking about.
0x3667ad8: And you?
0x3667af4: Special Operations FOX-HOUND...
0x3667b24: Revolver Ocelot.
0x3667b48: I've been waiting for you, Solid Snake.
0x3667b84: Now we'll see if the man can live up to the legend!
0x3667bcc: This is the greatest handgun ever made.
0x3667c08: The Colt Single Action Army.
0x3667c38: Six bullets.
0x3667c58: More than enough to kill anything that moves.
0x3667c98: Now I'll show you why they call me...
0x3667cd0: "Revolver"
0x3667cec: Draw!
0x3b29120: You're pretty good.
0x3b29144: Just what I'd expect from the man with the same code as the boss.
0x3b29198: It's been a long time since I had such a good fight...
0x3b291e0: but I'm just getting warmed up.
0x3b29210: What!
0x3b29228: My hand!!!
0x3b29244: Aaaaaahhh!!
0x3b29260: Uuuunnhh! Ooooof!!
0x3b29284: Stealth camouflage!
0x3b292a8: Can't you even die right!?
0x3b292d4: You were lucky. We'll meet again!
0x3b29308: Who are you!
0x3b29328: I'm like you...I have no name.
0x3b29358: Ohhh...ohhhh!
0x3b29378: That...that exoskeleton...!
0x3b293a4: Ggggyyyaaaaaaahhh!!!
0x3b293cc: Ggggyyyyaaaaaaaahhh!!!
0x3b293f4: Gggggyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!
0x3b29424: Who the hell...?
0x3ef6920: I'm disappointed.
0x3ef6944: You're no match for the boss.
0x3ef6974: Playtime's over, friend. You're not cut out for war.
0x3ef69bc: Don't worry. I'll kill you quickly.
0x3ef69f4: What!
0x3ef6a0c: Aaaaaaahhh!!!
0x3ef6a2c: Aaaaaahhh!!
0x3ef6a48: Uuuunnhh! Ooooof!!
0x3ef6a6c: Stealth camouflage!
0x3ef6a90: Can't you even die right!?
0x3ef6abc: You were lucky. We'll meet again!
0x3ef6af0: Who are you!
0x3ef6b10: I'm like you...I have no name.
0x3ef6b40: Ohhh...ohhhh!
0x3ef6b60: That...that exoskeleton...!
0x3ef6b8c: Ggggyyyaaaaaaahhh!!!
0x3ef6bb4: Ggggyyyyaaaaaaaahhh!!!
0x3ef6bdc: Gggggyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!
0x3ef6c0c: Who the hell...?
0x42c08a8: Can you talk?
0x42c08c8: Who are you?
0x42c08e8: I'm not one of them.
0x42c0910: The DARPA Chief told me he gave them his detonation code.
0x42c095c: What about yours?
0x42c0980: Oh, I get it. Jim sent you...
0x42c09b0: You...you're from the Pentagon.
0x42c09e0: Answer my question!
0x42c0a04: What about your code!? There's no time!
0x42c0a40: I...
0x42c0a58: ...talked.
0x42c0a74: What!
0x42c0a8c: Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime!
0x42c0ad8: It's not like I didn't fight.
0x42c0b08: I managed to resist Psycho Mantis' mind probe.
0x42c0b48: He couldn't read you? How'd you do it?
0x42c0b80: Surgical implants in my brain.
0x42c0bb0: Surgical implants?
0x42c0bd4: Kind of like a psychic insulation.
0x42c0c08: Everyone who knows these top-secret codes has it.
0x42c0c4c: Even the DARPA Chief?
0x42c0c74: Of course.
0x42c0c90: But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind.
0x42c0ce4: Are you sure you heard him right?
0x42c0d18: Yeah, I'm sure...
0x42c0d3c: In that case, how did they get your code?
0x42c0d78: I never had any training on how to resist torture...
0x42c0dc0: It looks like he had some fun with you all right.
0x42c0e04: He's not human.
0x42c0e24: I tell you he loved every second of it...
0x42c0e60: What happened to your arm.
0x42c0e8c: He broke it.
0x42c0eac: Looks like you're more than even now. His was sliced off.
0x42c0ef8: Ha. You're a funny man.
0x42c0f24: ...So...the DARPA Chief... is he okay?
0x42c0f5c: Dead.
0x42c0f74: What!?
0x42c0f8c: It can't be!
0x42c0fac: You know, that's not what you promised, Jim!
0x42c0fec: Now you want to shut me up!
0x42c1018: Calm down!
0x42c1034: What's wrong with you? 
0x42c105c: I just told you I was here to save you!
0x42c1098: I didn't kill the DARPA Chief.
0x4713698: He had a heart attack or something...
0x47136d0: A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool...
0x471370c: Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now.
0x471374c: Those boys are totally insane.
0x471377c: They wouldn't hesitate to launch...
0x47137b0: I agree. But what do they really want?
0x47137e8: Who knows.
0x4713804: Maybe they're like us in the arms industry...
0x4713844: Always looking forward to the next good war...
0x4713884: Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war today.
0x47138d0: Do you still have the card keys?
0x4713904: Card keys?
0x4713920: To override the detonation code! I heard you had them...
0x471396c: No, not anymore...
0x4713990: What!? Who does then!? Not the terrorists!?
0x47139d0: No. That woman.
0x47139f0: Woman!? Who?
0x4713a10: A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me.
0x4713a54: A female soldier? It must be...
0x4713a84: She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.
0x4713acc: They threw her in prison...
0x4713af8: 'cause she refused to take part in the rebellion.
0x4713b3c: A new recruit? Could that be the Colonel's niece!?
0x4713b80: I gave her the key.
0x4713ba4: Looks like she managed to break out of here though.
0x4713bec: I hope she's okay.
0x4713c10: I'm sure she is.
0x4713c34: She's green ...but as tough as they come.
0x4713c70: But how did you know she escaped?
0x4713ca4: I was in contact with her by Codec.
0x4713cdc: Until I was tied up here that is.
0x4713d10: Codec?
0x4713d28: Yes. She stole it from the guard.
0x4713d5c: If she still has it, you should be able to contact her.
0x4713da8: I'm sure she still has it. What frequency was she at?
0x4713df0: Oh yeah. Let me tell you. It's...
0x4713e24: Huh?
0x4713e3c: ...Oh...Sorry....
0x4713e60: ...I forgot.
0x4713e80: Damn!
0x4713e98: Oh that's right! It should be on the back of the CD case.
0x4b67bc0: Try to contact her.
0x4b67be4: I'll contact her right away.
0x4b67c14: But tell me...if this doesn't work, 
0x4b67c4c: is there some other way to prevent the missile launch?
0x4bbd0a8: Hmmm.
0x4bbd0c0: You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees.
0x4bbd108: Who's that?
0x4bbd124: The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.
0x4bbd164: A genius at engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.
0x4bbd1b0: If there's anyone who can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching,
0x4bbd210: it's him.
0x4bbd22c: What if he can't come up with anything?
0x4bbd264: You'll have to destroy it.
0x4bbd290: Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x4bbd2cc: Where is this Emmerich?
0x4bbd2f4: Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the...
0x4bbd33c: Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.
0x4bbd370: It's north from here. That's where he worked.
0x4bbd3b0: I understand, but...why Metal Gear?
0x4bbd3e4: The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium.
0x4bbd42c: You're wrong. The threat of nuclear war isn't gone...
0x4bbd474: ...in fact it's greater than it's ever been.
0x4db90cc: there's plenty of available nuclear material and scientists...
0x4db911c: for making a bomb.
0x4db9140: We live in an age when any small country...
0x4db9180: can have a nuclear weapons program.
0x4db91b4: What about the other superpowers?
0x4db91e8: Russia and China still maintain a significant nuclear presence.
0x4db923c: Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility...
0x4db9284: To maintain our own policy of deterrence,
0x4db92c0: we need a weapon of overwhelming power.
0x4edb880: You mean Metal Gear.
0x4edb8a8: Yes.
0x4edb8c0: You know, our industry suffered quite a blow...
0x4edb904: as a result of the cuts in military budgets...
0x4edb944: due to this so-called "peace".
0x4edb974: I remember hearing a lot about mergers and takeovers
0x4edb9bc: among the big weapons makers.
0x4edba04: And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's
0x4edba54: next line of fighter jet,
0x4edba80: the Metal Gear system was our last ace in the hole.
0x4edbac8: That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear
0x4edbb04: developed as a black project.
0x4edbb34: Black project?
0x4edbb54: Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.
0x4edbba0: You can avoid a lot of red tape and get a great leadtime
0x4edbbec: on your weapons production.
0x4edbc18: And no one can bother you...
0x4edbc48: Not even those bleeding heart liberals on the military oversight committee.
0x507690c: Bribes...
0x5076928: I prefer to think of it as good business...
0x5076968: Anyway, Metal Gear was going to be formally adopted...
0x50769b0: after the results of this exercise were analyzed....
0x50769f8: I don't give a crap about you and your company.
0x5076a3c: Yes. That's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you...
0x5076aa0: This is what you came for, right?
0x5076ad4: What's that?
0x5076af4: An optical disk. It's all here.
0x5076b24: The main hard drive was destroyed by gunfire.
0x5076b64: This is the only remaining copy of the data.
0x5076ba4: What kind of data?
0x5076bc8: All the data collected from this exercise.
0x5076c04: Don't play dumb.
0x5076c28: I know you were sent to get this.
0x5076c5c: I hid it from that sadistic maniac while he was torturing me.
0x5076cac: They don't know that this disk exists.
0x5076ce4: Make sure that you report this to Jim...to your boss.
0x5076d2c: I'll give you my card too.
0x5076d58: It'll open up all security level 2 doors.
0x5076d94: Can you walk?
0x5076db4: ...No.
0x5076dcc: ...You go on without me.
0x5076df8: They got my password...they don't want anything else from me.
0x5076e48: I have one more question.
0x5076e74: Who or what was that ninja thing?
0x5076ea8: It looked like you knew something.
0x5076edc: That ninja?
0x5076ef8: That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret...
0x5076f34: Dark little secret?
0x5076f58: An experimental...genome... soldier...
0x5076f90: You know him?
0x5076fb0: You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.
0x5076ff4: She knows better than I...
0x5077020: Naomi?
0x5077038: You've got to stop them...
0x5077064: If it goes public, my company and I are...finished...
0x50770ac: What?
0x50770c4: Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology?
0x507710c: Metal Gear itself does, but...
0x555e9bc: Huh!?
0x555e9d4: What...what did you do to me!?
0x555ea04: Uh...Oooh..No!..Ooh
0x555ea28: Oh no, It can't be!...
0x555ea50: ...those Pentagon bastards!
0x555ea7c: ...So they...they actually went and did it...!
0x555eabc: What are you talking about!
0x555eae8: They...they're just...using you for...
0x555eb20: uuuhhh...
0x555eb3c: Uuuuhhh...
0x555eb58: What the hell?
0x57500e4: This is Raven's territory...
0x5750114: Snakes don't belong in Alaska...
0x5750148: I will not let you pass...
0x5750174: Send him a message!
0x5750198: Ha ha ha ha ha ...
0x57501bc: That's right... You belong on the ground.
0x57501f8: You should crawl on the ground like the snake you are!
0x5750240: Come, let's fight!
0x5a8b154: Well, Boss, I hope you are happy. He got the card.
0x5a8b198: ...We'll play with him a little longer...
0x5a8b1d4: You would be wise not to underestimate him.
0x5a8b214: What did you think of him?
0x5a8b240: He is just as you said.
0x5a8b268: In battle, he is as if possessed by a demon.
0x5a8b2a8: Much like you. I would expect no less.
0x5a8b2e0: You see? I told you so.
0x5a8b308: But I will kill him.
0x5a8b330: So, General Ivan,
0x5a8b354: I hear he took your hand as well as your dignity?
0x5a8b398: Watch your tongue, Shaman!
0x5a8b3c4: In the language of the Sioux people, "Sioux" means snake.
0x5a8b411: It is known as an animal to be feared. 
0x5a8b44c: Well, Snake is mine now...
0x5a8b478: When I meet him next, I'll take special care of him.
0x5a8b4c0: Not yet.
0x5a8b4dc: Don't kill him yet...
0x5a8b504: He and I will meet again in battle.
0x5a8b53c: Same prediction as always?
0x5a8b568: Yes. The raven on my head...
0x5a8b598: ...It thirsts for his blood.
0x5f1e8a8: It looks like they were cut by some type of blade.
0x60c00e4: Stealth camouflage? Who are you?
0x60c0118: Where is my friend?
0x60c013c: What...what are you talking about?
0x60c0170: What next?
0x60c018c: Snake!!
0x60c01a4: You're that Ninja...
0x60c01cc: I've been waiting for you, Snake.
0x60c0200: Who are you!?
0x60c0220: Neither enemy nor friend.
0x60c024c: I am back from a world where such words are meaningless...
0x60c0298: I've removed all obstacles.
0x60c02c4: Now you and I will battle to the death.
0x60c0300: What do you want?
0x60c0324: I've waited a long time for this day.
0x60c035c: Now I want to enjoy the moment.
0x60c038c: What...what's with these guys?
0x60c03bc: ...It's like one of my Japanese animes...
0x60c03f8: I've come from another world to do battle with you.
0x60c0440: What is it? Revenge?
0x60c0468: It is nothing so trivial as revenge.
0x60c04a0: A fight to the death with you.
0x60c04d0: Only in that can my soul find respite.
0x60c0508: I will kill you...
0x60c052c: or you will kill me...
0x60c0554: ...it makes no difference.
0x60c0580: Waaaaaaaaahhh!!!
0x60c05a4: Hah! Fine!
0x60c05c0: He can watch from inside there.
0x60c05f0: I need that man. Keep your hands off him.
0x65ee0d0: I felt that, Snake...
0x65ee0f8: Do you remember me now?
0x65ee120: It can't be...!
0x65ee140: You were killed in Zanzibar...
0x65ee170: Eeeeyaaaaah! 
0x65ee190: What!? Not again!!
0x65ee1b4: The...the mediciiiiiine!
0x65ee1e0: What's happening?
0x65ee204: ...I...I...I'm losing myself....
0x65ee238: Is it over?
0x65ee254: Waaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!
0x69418d0: How long are you gonna stay in there?
0x6941908: Huh?...Are you one of them?
0x6941934: No, I'm not. I always work alone.
0x6941968: Alone?
0x6941980: Are you an Otaku too?
0x69419a8: C'mon get out.
0x69419c8: We can't stay here forever.
0x69419f4: Your uniform's different than theirs.
0x6941a2c: You're the Metal Gear chief engineer, Hal Emmerich, right?
0x6941a78: You know me?
0x6941a98: I heard about you from Meryl.
0x6941ac8: Oh. So you're here to rescue me?
0x6941afc: Sorry, but no.
0x6941b1c: There's something that I've got to do first.
0x6941b5c: Oh. well...at least you're not one of them...
0x6941b9c: Huh? Are you hurt?
0x6941bc0: I'm okay.
0x6941bdc: I just twisted my ankle a little bit trying to get away.
0x6941c28: Well if that's all, it's nothing to worry about.
0x6942984: ??/0//? >
0x6c218bc: I want to ask you something.
0x6c218ec: I need information about Metal Gear.
0x6c21924: Huh? Metal Gear?
0x6c21948: Yeah. What's Metal Gear really designed for?
0x6c21988: It's a mobile TMD (theater missile defense). 
0x6c219c8: It's designed to shoot down nuclear missiles...
0x6c21a0c: ...only for defensive purposes, of course.
0x6c21a48: Liar!
0x6c21a60: I already know that Metal Gear is nothing but a nuclear-equipped,
0x6c21ab4: walking death-mobile!
0x6c21adc: Nuclear? What are you talking about?
0x6c21b14: The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a nuclear missile.
0x6c21b70: You telling me you didn't know?
0x6c21ba0: They're gonna put a dismantled warhead into Metal Gear's...
0x6c21bf0: TMD missile module?
0x6c21c14: Wrong.
0x6c21c2c: From the beginning, the purpose of this exercise was to...
0x6c21c78: test Metal Gear's nuclear launch capability...
0x6c21cb8: using a dummy nuclear warhead.
0x6c21ce8: The terrorists are just continuing the work...
0x6c21d28: you started!
0x6c21d48: No, you're wrong...
0x6c21d6c: I heard it directly from your boss, Baker.
0x6c21da8: No...a nuclear missile on Rex...?
0x6c21ddc: ...So you really didn't know?
0x6c21e0c: No. All the armament was built by a separate department...
0x6c21e58: and the president personally supervised the final assembly...
0x6c21ea8: of the main unit.
0x6c21ecc: President Baker?
0x6c21ef0: Yeah.
0x6c21f08: I was never told exactly what they armed Rex with.
0x6c21f4c: I...I only know it's equipped with a vulcan cannon, a laser and a rail gun.
0x6fe3880: A rail gun, you said?
0x6fe38a8: Yeah.
0x6fe38c0: It uses magnets to fire bullets at extremely high velocities.
0x6fe3910: The technology was originally developed for the SDI system...
0x6fe3960: and later scrapped.
0x6fe3984: We were successful in miniaturizing it
0x6fe39bc: in a joint venture between ArmsTech
0x6fe39f0: and Rivermore National Labs.
0x6fe3a20: The rail gun is on Rex's right arm.
0x6fe3a58: Metal Gear's main function is to launch nuclear missiles.
0x6fe3aa4: You sure you're not forgetting something?
0x6fe3ae0: It's true that Metal Gear has a missile module on his back
0x6fe3b2c: that can carry up to 8 missiles. But...
0x6fe3b68: ...are you saying it was originally meant
0x6fe3ba4: to carry nuclear missiles?
0x71238d0: Yeah. But that's not all I think.
0x7123904: If Metal Gear fired only standard nuclear missiles,
0x712394c: then they should already have all the practical data they need.
0x71239a0: No...
0x71239b8: ...could it be?
0x71d88bc: These are some of the supercomputers.
0x71d88f4: If you link these,
0x71d8918: you can test everything in a virtual environment.
0x71d895c: But it's all just theoretical...
0x71d8990: So this exercise was designed to test the real thing?
0x71d89d8: What did our president do!?
0x71d8a04: If the terrorists launch that thing...
0x71d8a3c: Damn!!
0x71d8a54: ...Damn!!
0x71d8a70: I'm such a fool! It's all my fault...
0x73458bc: I used to think that I could use science to help mankind.
0x7345908: But the one that wound up getting used was me...
0x734594c: Using science to help mankind... that's just in the movies...
0x734599c: That's enough crying. Pull yourself together!
0x73459dc: Where is Metal Gear?
0x7345a04: Where on this base are they keeping it?
0x7435880: Rex is in the underground maintenance base.
0x74358c0: Where is that?
0x74358e0: North of the Communications Tower. But it's a long way there.
0x7435930: The emergency override system...
0x7435964: for the detonation code is there too?
0x743599c: Yeah.
0x74359b4: ...In the maintenance base's Control Room.
0x74359f0: You'd better hurry.
0x7435a14: If they were planning a launch from the start,
0x7435a54: then their ballistic program is probably finished.
0x7435a98: And since they haven't called for me in a few hours,
0x7435ae0: they must not need me.
0x7435b08: In other words, they must be ready to launch.
0x7435b48: Meryl's got the detonation code override keys.
0x7435b88: We'll link up with her.
0x7435bb0: If we can't override the launch, we'll have to destroy Rex.
0x756b8bc: I'll show you the way.
0x756b8e4: On that leg of yours? You'll just slow me down.
0x756b928: You'll need me if you're gonna destroy Rex.
0x756b968: I don't need you. I just need your brain.
0x756b9a4: I created Rex.
0x756b9c4: It's my right...my duty to destroy him.
0x756ba00: If you get a chance, try to escape.
0x756ba38: When the coast is clear I'll contact you by Codec.
0x756ba7c: How am I supposed to escape from an island?
0x756babc: Okay.
0x756bad4: So what then?
0x756baf4: I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed.
0x756bb38: You know this place well, don't you?
0x756bb70: Course I do. And don't worry. ...I've got this.
0x756bbb4: It's the same stealth technology as the Ninja.
0x756bbf4: FOX-HOUND was going to use them, but...
0x756bc30: With this I'll be fine, bad leg and all.
0x756bc6c: Good. But I want Meryl to watch after you too.
0x78090d0: Something's wrong.
0x78090f4: Did you hear something? Wasn't that some kind of music?
0x7809140: What did she look like?
0x7809168: She...she was wearing the same green uniform as the terrorists.
0x789d8bc: A disguise?
0x789d8d8: She had such a cute way of walking.
0x789d910: She kind of wiggles her behind...
0x789d944: You were really looking.
0x789d970: Well...she's got a very cute behind...
0x789d9a8: Way of walking, huh.
0x789ddd6: ]Z/^\>/0
0x79118e4: If she's disguised as the enemy,
0x7911918: you'll have to contact her when she's alone, huh.
0x791195c: There's only one place where we can be sure she's by herself.
0x79119ac: Where's that.
0x79119cc: Don't be so dense...
0x79119f4: Here...use this security card.
0x7911a24: It's security level 4.
0x7911a4c: You're not in pain are you!?
0x7911a7c: Huh?
0x7911a94: You feel okay? Nothing bothering you?
0x7911acc: What's wrong? Getting friendly all of a sudden?
0x7911b10: Oh nothing... I'm glad you're okay.
0x7911b48: You're strange.
0x7911b68: I'm little nervous. Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies.
0x7911bb8: You're bad luck.
0x7911bdc: Forget it, Doctor.
0x7911c00: Call me Otacon.
0x7911c20: Otacon?
0x7911c38: It stands for Otaku Convention.
0x7911c68: An Otaku is a guy like me who likes Japanimation.
0x7b780d0: You're right. We have to take responsibility.
0x7b78110: Science has always thrived on war.
0x7b78144: The greatest weapons of mass destruction were created by...
0x7b78194: scientists who wanted to be famous.
0x7b781c8: But that's all over now. I won't take part in murder anymore.
0x7b78218: Whatever. All I want from you is information.
0x7b78258: Sure. I know everything about this whole base.
0x7b78298: Ask me anything about Rex or about this place...
0x7b782dc: Also, with this stealth camouflage,
0x7b78314: I can sneak in and out of the armory and mess hall.
0x7b7835c: If you need ammo or rations, just tell me and I'll bring them to you.
0x7b783b4: I'm on frequency 141.12.
0x7b783e0: See ya later...
0x7db70e4: That's the second time I've been able to sneak up on the legendary Solid Snake.
0x7db7148: You're Meryl?
0x7db7168: There's no way you could pass for a man for long.
0x7db71ac: What do you mean?
0x7db71d0: Hey! Men aren't allowed in here.
0x7db7204: I had no idea you were so feminine.
0x7db723c: This is no time to try and hit on me, Snake.
0x7db727c: Besides, it's a waste of time.
0x7db72ac: When I joined up,
0x7db72d0: they gave me psychotherapy to destroy my interest in men.
0x7db731c: Same smart mouth... you're Meryl all right.
0x7db735c: Are you hurt?
0x7db737c: Not yet. After all, I was disguised as a Genome Soldier.
0x7db73c8: So why'd you change?
0x7db73f0: You'd be a lot better off dressed like one of them.
0x7db7438: ...I got tired of disguising myself.
0x7db7470: The truth is... the uniform smelled like blood...
0x7db74b4: What's that mark?
0x7db74d8: Huh? Oh. This?
0x7db74f8: It's a paint tattoo. It's not real.
0x7db752c: I was a fan of FOX-HOUND way back.
0x7db7560: When guys like you and my uncle were in it.
0x7db75a0: None of that gene therapy like there is today. You guys were real heroes. 
0x7db75fc: There are no heroes in war.
0x7db7628: All the heroes I know are either dead...or in prison.
0x7db7670: One or the other.
0x7db7694: But, Snake. You're a hero. Aren't you?
0x7db76cc: I'm just a man who's good at what he does. Killing.
0x7db7714: There's no winning or losing for a mercenary.
0x7db7754: The only winners in war are the people.
0x7db7790: That's right. And you fight for the people.
0x7db77d0: I've never fought for anyone but myself.
0x7db780c: I've got no purpose in life. No ultimate goal...
0x7db7850: Come on.
0x7db786c: It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.
0x7db78b4: The only time I feel truly alive.
0x81eaea8: Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh?
0x81eaeec: You love war and don't want it to stop...
0x81eaf28: Is it the same with all great soldiers throughout history?
0x81eaf74: Why didn't you contact me?
0x81eafa0: My Codec was broken.
0x81eafc8: Is that all?
0x81eafe8: Shouldn't you just be happy we met up like this!?
0x81eb02c: How did you recognize me in disguise?
0x81eb064: I never forget a lady.
0x81eb08c: So there's something you like about me, huh?
0x81eb0cc: Yeah, you've got a great butt.
0x81eb0fc: Oh I see...first it's my eyes, now it's my butt. 
0x81eb140: What's next?
0x81eb160: On the battlefield you never think about what's next.
0x83720e4: That's the second time I've been able to sneak up on the legendary Solid Snake.
0x8372148: You're Meryl?
0x8372168: There's no way you could pass for a man for long.
0x83721ac: What do you mean?
0x83721d0: Hey! Men aren't allowed in here.
0x8372204: I had no idea you were so feminine.
0x837223c: This is no time to try and hit on me, Snake.
0x837227c: Besides, it's a waste of time.
0x83722ac: When I joined up, 
0x83722d0: they gave me psychotherapy to destroy my interest in men.
0x837231c: Same smart mouth... you're Meryl all right.
0x837235c: Are you hurt?
0x837237c: Not yet. After all, I was disguised as a Genome Soldier.
0x83723c8: So why'd you change?
0x83723f0: You'd be a lot better off dressed like one of them.
0x8372438: ...I got tired of disguising myself.
0x8372470: The truth is... the uniform smelled like blood...
0x83724b4: What's that mark?
0x83724d8: Huh? Oh. This?
0x83724f8: It's a paint tattoo. It's not real.
0x837252c: I was a fan of FOX-HOUND way back.
0x8372560: When guys like you and my uncle were in it.
0x83725a0: None of that gene therapy like there is today. You guys were real heroes. 
0x83725fc: There are no heroes in war.
0x8372628: All the heroes I know are either dead...or in prison.
0x8372670: One or the other.
0x8372694: But, Snake. You're a hero. Aren't you?
0x83726cc: I'm just a man who's good at what he does. Killing.
0x8372714: There's no winning or losing for a mercenary.
0x8372754: The only winners in war are the people.
0x8372790: That's right. And you fight for the people.
0x83727d0: I've never fought for anyone but myself.
0x837280c: I've got no purpose in life. No ultimate goal...
0x8372850: Come on.
0x837286c: It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.
0x83728b4: The only time I feel truly alive.
0x87a5ea8: Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh?
0x87a5eec: You love war and don't want it to stop...
0x87a5f28: Is it the same with all great soldiers throughout history?
0x87a5f74: Why didn't you contact me?
0x87a5fa0: My Codec was broken.
0x87a5fc8: Is that all?
0x87a5fe8: Shouldn't you just be happy we met up like this!?
0x87a602c: How did you recognize me in disguise?
0x87a6064: I never forget a lady.
0x87a608c: So there's something you like about me, huh?
0x87a60cc: Yeah, you've got a great butt.
0x87a60fc: Oh I see...first it's my eyes, now it's my butt. 
0x87a6140: What's next?
0x87a6160: On the battlefield you never think about what's next.
0x892d0e4: So Snake... how are the negotiations going?
0x892d124: No progress.
0x892d144: So it's all up to you, huh?
0x892d170: Somebody's got to stop them from launching a nuclear missile.
0x892d1c0: There are two ways. Either we destroy Metal Gear, or...
0x892d20c: ...we override the detonation code.
0x892d240: You got the card keys from Baker?
0x892d274: ...Card keys?
0x892d294: You mean this?
0x892d2b4: Where are the others? There should be three keys.
0x892d2f8: This is all I've got.
0x892d320: Where could the other two be?
0x892d350: I have no idea, but they must be somewhere.
0x892d390: If we can't find them we'll have no choice
0x892d3d0: but to destroy Metal Gear.
0x892d3fc: Metal Gear is in an underground maintenance base to the north.
0x892d44c: Take me too. I know this place better than you do.
0x892d490: You'll just slow me down. You don't have enough battle experience.
0x892d4e4: I won't slow you down. I promise...
0x892d51c: And what if you do?
0x892d540: Then you can shoot me.
0x892d568: I don't like to waste bullets.
0x8bbe148: Got it.
0x8bbe160: I'll be careful...
0x8bbe184: Y'know...I don't use makeup the way other women do...
0x8bbe1cc: I hardly ever look at myself in the mirror.
0x8bbe20c: I've always despised that kind of woman.
0x8bbe248: I always dreamed of becoming a soldier.
0x8bbe284: But I was wrong...
0x8bbe2a8: It wasn't really my dream.
0x8bbe2d4: My father...
0x8bbe2f4: ...he was killed in action when I was younger.
0x8bbe334: You wanted to follow in your father's footsteps?
0x8bbe378: Not really.
0x8bbe394: I thought that if I became a soldier I could understand him better.
0x8bbe3ec: So are you a soldier yet?
0x8bbe418: I thought I was until today. But...now I understand.
0x8bbe460: The truth is I was just afraid of looking at myself.
0x8bbe4a8: Afraid of having to make my own decisions in life.
0x8bbe4ec: But I'm not going to lie to myself anymore.
0x8bbe52c: It's time I took a long hard look at myself...
0x8bbe56c: I want to know who I am, what I'm capable of...
0x8bbe5b0: I want to know why I've lived the way I've lived until now.
0x8bbe600: I want to know...
0x8bbe624: Take a good look. You won't get another chance for a while.
0x8bbe674: You should wash your face too while you're at it.
0x8bbe6b8: Yeah...
0x8bbe6d0: This isn't a training exercise. Our lives are riding on this.
0x8bbe720: There are no heroes or heroines. If you lose, you're worm food.
0x8bbe78c: Is that FAMAS functional?
0x8bbe7b8: Unfortunately it's out of ammo.
0x8bbe7e8: Where did ya get that Desert Eagle?
0x8bbe81c: I found it in the armory.
0x8bbe848: It's a .50 caliber Action Express...
0x8bbe880: There was a SOCOM pistol too, but I chose this.
0x8bbe8c4: Hmm. So I got a leftover, huh.
0x8bbe8f4: Isn't that gun a little big for a girl?
0x8bbe930: Don't worry, I can handle it.
0x909fa80: C'mon. Use my .45.
0x909faa4: Listen, I've used a gun like this since I was 8 years old.
0x909faf0: I'm more comfortable with it than I am with a bra.
0x909fb34: If we're gonna go to the north,
0x909fb64: we'll have to go through the Commander's Room on this floor.
0x909fbb4: The overland route is blocked by glaciers.
0x909fbf0: The door to the commander's room is security level 5.
0x909fc38: This card will open it.
0x909fc60: It was inside the pocket of the uniform I was wearing.
0x909fca8: Looks like he must have been guarding someplace important.
0x92398a8: My head!....Ooh. It hurts!...
0x92398d8: What's wrong?
0x92398f8: Don't come here, Snake!
0x92d80bc: Are you okay!!?
0x92d80dc: What happened!?
0x92d80fc: ...I'm fine.
0x92d811c: Okay.
0x92d8134: Let's go.
0x93ed0d0: Snake...
0x93ed0ec: do you...like me?
0x93ed110: What the...
0x93ed12c: Do you like me?
0x93ed14c: Hold me, Snake!
0x93ed16c: What's wrong!?
0x93ed18c: Hurry...hurry! Make love to me!!
0x93ed1c0: Snake, I want you!!
0x93ed1e4: Who's that!?
0x93ed204: Huh?
0x93ed21c: You don't like girls!?
0x951f8d0: Useless woman!
0x951f8f0: Optic camouflage, huh?
0x951f918: I hope that's not your only trick.
0x951f964: You doubt my power!?
0x951f98c: Now I will show you...
0x951f9b4: why I am the most powerful practitioner of...
0x951f9f4: psychokinesis and telepathy in the world.
0x951fa30: No...there's no need for words, Snake.
0x951fa68: I am Psycho Mantis.
0x951fa8c: That's right...this is no trick. It is true power.
0x951fad0: It's useless. I told you...
0x951fafc: I can read your every thought.
0x9751134: So...you used the other...
0x9751160: I...I wasn't able to read the future...
0x9751198: A strong man doesn't need to read the future.
0x97511d8: He makes his own.
0x97511fc: Perhaps so...
0x975121c: But I will read your future...
0x975124c: To get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base,
0x9751294: ...you have to go through that hidden door.
0x97512d4: There's a hidden door behind the bookcase.
0x9751310: The overland route...
0x9751338: it's blocked by frozen glaciers.
0x975136c: Go past the Communication Towers.
0x97513a0: Then use the tower's walkway.
0x9a5f120: Why are you telling me this?
0x9a5f150: I can read people's minds.
0x9a5f17c: In my lifetime, I have read the pasts, presents and futures...
0x9a5f1cc: of thousands upon thousands of men and women...
0x9a5f210: Oh...gross...
0x9a5f230: And each mind that I peered into...
0x9a5f264: was stuffed with the same single object of obsession.
0x9a5f2ac: That selfish and atavistic desire to pass on one's seed...
0x9a5f2f8: ...it was enough to make me sick.
0x9a5f32c: Every living thing on this planet exists to mindlessly pass on their DNA.
0x9a5f388: We're designed that way.
0x9a5f3b4: And that's why there is war.
0x9a5f3e4: But you...
0x9a5f400: ...you are different...
0x9a5f428: You're the same as us.
0x9a5f450: We have no past, no future.
0x9a5f47c: We live in the moment.
0x9a5f4a4: That's our only purpose.
0x9a5f4d0: Humans weren't designed to bring each other happiness.
0x9a5f518: From the moment we're thrown into this world,
0x9a5f558: we're fated to bring each other nothing but pain and misery.
0x9a5f5a8: The first person who's mind I dove into was my father's.
0x9a5f5f4: I saw nothing but disgust and hatred for me in his heart.
0x9a5f640: My mother died in childbirth...
0x9a5f670: and he despised me for it...
0x9a5f6a0: I thought my father was going to kill me.
0x9a5f6dc: That's when my future disappeared.
0x9a5f710: I lost my past as well.
0x9a5f738: When I came to, the village was engulfed in flames...
0x9a5f780: Are you saying that you burned your village down to...
0x9a5f7c8: bury your past?
0x9a5f7e8: I see that you have suffered the same trauma. 
0x9a5f828: We are truly the same, you and I...
0xa1ea134: ...The world is a more interesting place with people like you in it...
0xa1ea18c: I never agreed with the Boss's revolution...
0xa1ea1cc: His dreams of world conquest do not interest me.
0xa1ea210: I just wanted an excuse to kill as many people as I could.
0xa1ea25c: You monster...!
0xa1ea27c: Let him talk.
0xa1ea29c: He doesn't have much time left.
0xa1ea2cc: I've seen true evil.
0xa1ea2f4: You Snake.
0xa1ea310: You're just like the Boss...
0xa1ea340: No, you're worse.
0xa1ea364: Compared to you, I'm not so bad.
0xa1ea398: ...I read her mind as well.
0xa1ea3c4: Meryl's?
0xa1ea3e0: I saw you there...
0xa1ea404: ...you have a large place in her heart.
0xa1ea440: A large place?
0xa1ea460: Yes. A large place.
0xa1ea484: But I do not know if your futures lie together.
0xa1ea4c8: I have a last request...
0xa1ea4f4: What is it?
0xa1ea510: My mask...put it back on.
0xa1ea53c: Okay...
0xa1ea554: Like this...other people's thoughts force their way into my mind.
0xa1ea5a8: Before I die...I want to be by myself.
0xa1ea5e0: I want to be left alone in my own world.
0xa1ea61c: ...I'll open the door for you.
0xa1ea64c: If you want to find your future, go through that door.
0xa1ea694: This is the first time...
0xa1ea6c0: ...I've ever used my power to help someone.
0xa1ea700: It's strange...
0xa1ea720: ...it feels...
0xa1ea740: ...kind of...
0xa1ea760: ...nice.
0xa91f8e4: Let's go, Meryl.
0xa91f908: I'm sorry...
0xa91f928: Meryl?
0xa91f940: How could I let Mantis control my mind like that...
0xa91f988: If you're going to doubt yourself, I'll leave you here.
0xa91f9d4: You're right.
0xa91f9f4: Never doubt yourself. Just let it make you stronger.
0xa91fa3c: Learn something from it.
0xa91fa88: I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
0xa91fab8: Snake, can I ask you something?
0xa91fae8: What!?
0xa91fb00: About what Mantis said...
0xa91fb2c: I was just wondering...
0xa91fb54: What? What's the problem now?
0xa91fb84: Oh no...nothing.
0xa91fba8: So tell me Snake.
0xa91fbcc: What's your name?
0xa91fbf0: Your real name?
0xa91fc10: Name means nothing on the battlefield.
0xa91fc48: How old are you?
0xa91fc6c: Old enough to know what death looks like...
0xa91fcac: Any family?
0xa91fcc8: No, but I was raised by many people.
0xa91fd00: Is there anyone you like?
0xa91fd2c: I've never been interested in anyone else's life...
0xa91fd74: So you are all alone. 
0xa91fd9c: Just like Mantis said...
0xa91fdc8: Other people just complicate my life.
0xa91fe00: I don't like to get involved.
0xa91fe30: ...You're a sad, lonely man.
0xa91fe60: C'mon...let's go...
0xad7e8a8: Could there be wolves in there?
0xad7e8d8: Wolf dogs. Half-wolf, half-huskie.
0xad7e90c: How do you know so much?
0xad7e938: I ride dog sleds. I'm a musher.
0xae9d0f8: Meryl??
0xae9d110: What is it?
0xae9d12c: Meryl, get down!!
0xae9d150: Aaaaaaaahhh!!!
0xae9d170: Meryl!!
0xae9d188: Oooooohhhh!!
0xae9d1a8: Aaaaaaaghhh!!
0xae9d1c8: Snake...
0xae9d1e4: leave me and run...
0xae9d208: Meryl...
0xae9d224: I guess...I am a rookie after all...
0xae9d25c: Don't worry, Meryl. It's me they want.
0xae9d294: Even I know that.
0xae9d2b8: It's the oldest trick in the book...
0xae9d2f0: The sniper's using me for bait to lure you out.
0xae9d334: Damn!!
0xae9d34c: Shoot me, Snake!!
0xae9d370: No!
0xae9d384: My gun...
0xae9d3a0: ...I can't reach it by myself...
0xae9d3d4: Don't move.
0xae9d3f0: I promised...
0xae9d410: ...I wouldn't slow you down!
0xae9d440: I...
0xae9d458: I...I...I can still help...
0xae9d484: I want to help you!
0xae9d4a8: Quiet down. Save your strength!
0xae9d4d8: I was a fool. I wanted to be a soldier...
0xae9d514: But war is ugly...There's nothing glamorous about it.
0xae9d55c: Snake, please! Save yourself!
0xae9d58c: Go on living and don't give up on people!
0xae9d5c8: Don't forget me...
0xae9d5ec: Now get out of here...!
0xb40c940: It's hard to miss when you're this close.
0xb40c97c: Toss your weapon over here.
0xb40c9a8: Slowly...
0xb40c9c4: You were a fool to come back here... stupid man!
0xb40ca08: A lady sniper, huh?
0xb40ca2c: Didn't you know that two thirds of the world's greatest assasins...
0xb40ca84: are women?
0xb40caa0: Do you want to die now?
0xb40cac8: Or after your female friend?
0xb40caf8: Which will it be?
0xb40cb1c: I'll die after I kill you.
0xb40cb48: Is that right?
0xb40cb68: Well at least you've got spirit.
0xb40cb9c: I'm Sniper Wolf and I always kill what I aim at.
0xb40cbe0: You're my...
0xb40cc00: special prey...
0xb40cc20: ...Got it?
0xb40cc3c: I've left my mark on you.
0xb40cc68: ...I won't forget it.
0xb40cc90: Until I kill you...
0xb40ccb4: you're all I'll think about.
0xb40cce4: Uuuhh!!
0xb40ccfc: Take him away...
0xb90b118: There definitely is a resemblance.
0xb90b14c: Don't you think, little brother?
0xb90b180: Or should I say big brother?
0xb90b1b0: I'm not sure...
0xb90b1d0: Anyway, it doesn't matter.
0xb90b1fc: You and I are both the last surviving
0xb90b234: "sons of Big Boss".
0xb90b258: It's me...
0xb90b274: Really?
0xb90b28c: Then what?
0xb90b2a8: Those idiots!
0xb90b2c8: Alright, Raven. I'll be right there.
0xb90b300: They're not responding to our demands.
0xb90b338: We'll launch the first one in 10 hours as planned.
0xb90b37c: Damn Americans!!
0xb90b3a0: Looks like you read them wrong.
0xb90b3d0: Something's funny...
0xb90b3f8: Normally the Americans are the first ones to the negotiating table.
0xb90b450: They must think they have something up their sleeves...
0xb90b49c: So it's come down to it, has it.
0xb90b4d0: We're gonna launch that nuke and ride it all the way into history.
0xb90b524: I've got to take care of some launch preparations.
0xb90b568: You're in charge here, Ocelot.
0xb90b598: What about you?
0xb90b5b8: Wanna stay for the show?
0xb90b5e4: I'm not interested.
0xb90b608: It's time to feed the family.
0xb90b638: So you prefer your wolves to my show, huh?
0xb90b674: Ocelot, don't screw up like you did with the Chief.
0xb90b6bc: Yes, I know.
0xb90b6dc: That was an accident.
0xb90b704: I didn't think a pencil pusher like him would be so tough.
0xb90b750: Well...
0xb90b768: his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy.
0xb90b7b0: Boss, what about that ninja?
0xb90b7e0: He's killed 12 men.
0xb90b804: Whoever he is, he's some kind of lunatic.
0xb90b840: Bastard took my hand...
0xb90b868: How could he have gotten in here?
0xb90b89c: Perhaps there's a spy among us...
0xb90b8d0: Mantis is dead.
0xb90b8f0: We've also got to find out what killed Baker and Octopus.
0xb90d652: P`Lb_A@T
0xbf0048c: We're shorthanded,
0xbf004b0: so make this little torture show of yours as short as possible.
0xbf00504: Torture?
0xbf00520: This is an interrogation.
0xbf0054c: As you wish.
0xbf0056c: See you later, brother.
0xbf00594: Your woman is still in this world...
0xbf005cc: Meryl?
0xbf005e4: Catch you later...handsome.
0xbf00610: Once she picks a target, she doesn't think about anything else.
0xbf00664: Sometimes she even falls in love with them before she kills them.
0xbf006b8: Finally, just the two of us.
0xbf006e8: How are you feeling?
0xbf00710: Not bad. I caught a nice nap on this revolving bed of yours.
0xbf00760: Too bad I was sleeping alone.
0xbf00790: Glad to hear that.
0xbf007b4: This is some bed all right...
0xbf007e4: I'm about to show you some of its nicer features...
0xbf0082c: Where are my things?
0xbf00854: Oh, don't worry, they're all there.
0xbf00888: Washington was taking quite a chance sending you here.
0xbf008d0: Someone must have a lot of faith in your skill. Huh, carrier boy?
0xbf00924: So...
0xbf0093c: Metal Gear is armed with a new type of nuclear warhead, huh?
0xbf0098c: Why don't you go ask Campbell for the full story.
0xbf009d0: The Colonel?
0xbf009f0: By the way, you got an optical disc from President Baker, didn't you?
0xbf00a48: What if I did?
0xbf00a68: Is that the only disc?
0xbf00a90: There's no other data?
0xbf00ab8: What do you mean?
0xbf00adc: There's no copy?
0xbf00b00: If not, that's fine.
0xbf00b28: Is Meryl okay?
0xbf00b48: She's not dead yet.
0xbf00b6c: Wolf must have been feeling generous.
0xbf00ba4: But if you want her to stay that way
0xbf00bdc: you better start answering my questions right now.
0xbf00c20: You were holding one card key.
0xbf00c50: Where are the other two?
0xbf00c7c: What's the trick behind that key!?
0xc4eb1e4: Trick?
0xc4eb1fc: That weasel of a president said there's some kind of trick to using the key.
0xc4eb25c: Hell if I know.
0xc4eb27c: I see.
0xc4eb294: No problem then.
0xc4eb2b8: We're going to play a game, Snake.
0xc4eb2ec: And we'll find out what kind of man you really are.
0xc4eb334: When the pain becomes too great to bear,
0xc4eb370: just give up and your suffering will end.
0xc4eb3ac: But if you do, the girl's life is mine.
0xc655094: Looks like I got a roommate...
0xc6550c4: The DARPA Chief!?...
0xc6550ec: whew...what a stench!
0xc7048f8: It's me!
0xc704914: Otacon!
0xc70492c: Wow! They even captured you!
0xc70495c: Hurry! Get me out of here!
0xc704988: Lemme go!
0xc7049a4: That hurts!
0xc7049c0: Hurry up!
0xc7049dc: Is that how you ask a guy a favor?
0xc704a2c: Jeez!
0xc704a44: It's like an animal's cage.
0xc704a70: ...What a smell!
0xc704a94: Cause of him.
0xc704ab4: Eeyaaah!!
0xc704ad0: It's the DARPA Chief!!
0xc704af8: If you don't hurry up and get me out of here,
0xc704b38: I'll be laying next to him.
0xc704b64: Those bastards!
0xc704b84: This lock won't open with a security card.
0xc704bc0: You need a key like the soldiers carry.
0xc704bf8: So what are you doing here then?
0xc704c2c: I...
0xc704c44: I thought you might be hungry.
0xc704c74: If you need more food, I can bring some more later.
0xc704cbc: Also, I got you this level 6 card. It'll get you out of that Torture Room.
0xc704d18: Here, take this too...
0xc704d40: What's this?
0xc704d60: It's a handkerchief. I got it from Sniper Wolf.
0xc704da4: Why?
0xc704dbc: I don't know why, but she's nice to me.
0xc704df8: Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.
0xc704e30: I was taking care of the dogs here.
0xc704e64: After the terrorists took over, they were planning to shoot all the dogs.
0xc704ec0: But Sniper Wolf stopped 'em...
0xc704ef0: She even let me feed them when I asked.
0xc704f2c: She likes dogs. She must be a good person.
0xc704f68: Please don't hurt her.
0xc704f90: Wake up you idiot! She's the one who shot Meryl!
0xc704fd4: Well, that's all I can do...
0xc705004: They're planning to launch a nuke! I've got to stop them!
0xc705050: Then you'll have to get past the Communications Tower.
0xc705098: First, you have to get me out of here!
0xc7050d0: C'mon...I'm trying my best!...
0xcbcb7b0: That guard's got the key. You'll have to take him out!
0xcbcb7f8: Gimme a break! I'm no soldier!
0xcbcb828: I can't take anybody out!
0xcbcb854: You have to!!
0xcbcb874: I'll be killed!
0xcc778d4: I...
0xcc77904: I...I can still help...
0xcc7792c: I want to help you!
0xcc77950: Quiet down. Save your strength!
0xcc77984: I was a fool.
0xcc779a4: I wanted to be a soldier.
0xcc779d0: But war is ugly.
0xcc779f4: There's nothing glamorous about it.
0xcc77a28: Snake, please! Save yourself!
0xcc77a58: Go on living and don't give up on people!
0xcc77a94: Don't forget me...
0xd2268f8: Damn!!
0xd226910: Snaaaaake!!
0xd22692c: I'm afraid I can't let you get past here!
0xd226968: Liquid?
0xd226980: You're not going any farther.
0xd2269b0: Die!!!
0xd2269c8: It's a long way down. If only I had a rope.
0xd226a08: I should be able to use that rope I got...
0xd226a44: What are you going to do? Take on a Hind with your bare hands?
0xd226a94: Now you're mine!
0xd226ab8: If I stay here, I'm finished.
0xd49c0f8: Damn!!
0xd49c110: Snaaaaake!!
0xd49c12c: I'm afraid I can't let you get past here!
0xd49c168: Liquid?
0xd49c180: You're not going any further.
0xd49c1b0: Die!!!
0xd49c1c8: It's a long way down. If only I had a rope.
0xd49c208: There must be one around here somewhere.
0xd49c244: What are you going to do? Take on a Hind with your bare hands?
0xd49c294: Now you're mine!
0xd49c2b8: If I stay here, I'm finished.
0xd7128d0: Don't shoot!!
0xd7128f0: It's me! Don't shoot!
0xd712918: It's me, Snake!!
0xd71293c: Otacon? How'd you get here?
0xd71296c: It wasn't as dramatic as your entrance, believe me. I'm afraid of heights.
0xd7129c8: You were watching?
0xd7129ec: Yeah, I was watching.
0xd712a14: I was riding in the back of their truck...
0xd712a50: thanks to the stealth camouflage.
0xd712a84: How did you get up here?
0xd712ab0: The elevator, of course.
0xd712adc: The 1st floor of the circular staircase was destroyed.
0xd712b24: That's why I took the elevator...
0xd712b58: The elevator was working?
0xd712b84: Yeah...that's right.
0xd712bac: You're incredible...
0xd712bd4: like a movie hero or something.
0xd712c04: No...you're wrong.
0xd712c28: In the movies, the hero always saves the girl...
0xd712c6c: ...You mean Meryl?
0xd712c90: ...Sorry...
0xd712cac: forget I said anything...
0xd712cd8: Snake, there's something I've really got to ask you.
0xd712d20: It's why I followed you up this far...
0xd712d58: Have you ever ...loved someone?
0xd712d8c: That's what you came to ask?
0xd712dbc: No I mean...I...
0xd712de0: I was wondering if even soldiers fall in love...
0xd712e24: What are you trying to say?
0xd712e50: I wanna ask you...
0xd712e74: Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield?
0xd712eb8: Yeah...I do.
0xd712ed8: I think at any time, any place... people can fall in love with each other.
0xd712f34: But...
0xd712f4c: if you love someone, you have to be able to protect them...
0xd712f9c: I think so too.
0xd712fbc: I have a favor to ask.
0xd712fe4: Uh oh.
0xd712ffc: Don't worry. It'll be easy.
0xd71302c: Umm...I told you before, I don't wanna hurt anyone.
0xd713074: I don't want you to either.
0xd7130a0: Okay...
0xd7130b8: The elevator is stopped down there. I want you to get it to move.
0xdc73620: You see?
0xdc7363c: That's weird.
0xdc7365c: It was working before, but now it isn't.
0xdc73698: ...Maybe the panel's broken?
0xdc736c8: Can you fix it?
0xdc736e8: It was working before. If it's the mechanism, leave it to me.
0xdc73738: I've got to go and swat a noisy fly.
0xdc73770: Okay. I'll stay here and hold the fort.
0xdc737ac: Good luck.
0xdc737c8: You really look like hell. Are you okay?
0xdc73804: Don't worry.
0xdc73824: If I do this, it doesn't matter.
0xdc73858: I just pretend like I'm not here. Then I'm not scared.
0xdc738a0: Strange logic.
0xdc738c0: I'm counting on you.
0xdc73c42: 0^4 -S12@
0xdc74ce0: !3DC2#C3#
0xde7f90c: So the Snake's finally come out of his hole?
0xde7f94c: Are you ready now ...my brother?
0xde7f980: Why are you calling me brother?
0xde7f9b0: Who the hell are you!?
0xde7f9d8: I'm you.
0xde7f9f4: I'm your shadow.
0xde7fa18: What!?
0xde7fa30: Ask the father that you killed! I'll send you to hell to meet him!!
0xdfb28e4: C'mon, fly!
0xdfb2900: Damn!!
0xdfb2918: Snaaake!!
0xdfb2934: See you in hell...Liquid.
0xdfb2960: ...That takes care of the cremation.
0xe14b8d0: I...
0xe14b8e8: I've...
0xe14b900: ...waited for this moment...
0xe14b930: I am a sniper.
0xe14b950: Waiting is my job...
0xe14b978: Never moving a muscle...
0xe14b9a4: ...concentrating...
0xe14b9c8: I am lung-shot.
0xe14b9e8: Y...you cannot save me.
0xe14ba10: Please...
0xe14ba2c: Just finish me quick.
0xe14ba54: I am a Kurd.
0xe14ba74: I have always dreamed of a peaceful place like this...
0xe14babc: A Kurd?
0xe14bad4: So that's why you're called Wolf...
0xe14bb08: I was born on a battlefield.
0xe14bb38: Raised on a battlefield.
0xe14bb64: Gunfire, sirens and screams...
0xe14bb94: ...they were my lullabies...
0xe14bbc4: Hunted like dogs day after day...
0xe14bbf8: ...driven from our ragged shelters...
0xe14bc30: That...
0xe14bc48: ...was my life.
0xe14bc68: Each morning, I'd wake up...
0xe14bc98: and find a few more of my family or friends dead beside me.
0xe14bce8: I'd stare at the morning sun...
0xe14bd18: ...and pray to make it through the day.
0xe14bd54: The governments of the world turned a blind eye to our misery.
0xe14bda4: But then...
0xe14bdc0: ...he appeared.
0xe14bde0: My hero...
0xe14bdfc: Saladin...
0xe14be18: he took me away from all that...
0xe14be4c: Saladin?
0xe14be68: ...You mean Big Boss?
0xe14be90: I became a sniper...
0xe14beb8: hidden, watching everything through a rifle's scope.
0xe14bf00: Now I could see war, not from the inside,
0xe14bf3c: but from the outside,
0xe14bf64: ...as an observer...
0xe14bf8c: I watched the brutality...
0xe14bfb8: ...the stupidity of mankind through the scope of my rifle.
0xe14c004: I joined this group of revolutionaries...
0xe14c040: ...to take my revenge on the world.
0xe14c074: But...
0xe14c08c: I have shamed myself and my people.
0xe14c0c0: I am no longer the wolf I was born to be...
0xe9e7f98: In the name of vengeance, I sold my body and my soul.
0xe9e7fe0: Now...I am nothing more than a dog.
0xe9e8014: Wolves are noble animals.
0xe9e8040: They're not like dogs.
0xe9e8068: In Yupik, the word for wolf is "Kegluneq",
0xe9e80a4: and the Aleuts revere them as honorable cousins.
0xe9e80e8: They call mercenaries like us "Dogs of War".
0xe9e8128: It's true, we're all for sale at some price or another.
0xe9e8174: But you're different.
0xe9e819c: ...untamed...
0xe9e81bc: ...solitary.
0xe9e81dc: You're no dog...
0xe9e8200: You're a wolf.
0xe9e8220: Who are you?
0xe9e8240: ...Are you Saladin?
0xe9e8264: Wolf.
0xe9e827c: ...you spared Meryl's life.
0xe9e82a8: She...
0xe9e82c0: She was never my real target... I don't kill for sport.
0xe9e830c: Rest easy.
0xe9e8328: You'll die as the proud wolf you are.
0xe9e8360: I finally understand.
0xe9e8388: I wasn't waiting to kill people...
0xe9e83bc: I was waiting for someone to kill me...
0xe9e83f4: A man like you...
0xe9e8418: You're a hero.
0xe9e8438: Please...
0xe9e8454: set me free...


II. Full Codec Call text dump
--------------------------------

0x3e: Be careful, Snake. That air lock is set with infrared sensors.
0xa9: You probably can't see them with your naked eyes, but there are infrared beams coming out of that wall.
0x121: Touch any one of them, and the doors will seal off and the place will be flooded with poison gas.
0x193: Somehow you've got to get through without setting off those sensors.
0x237: I think you might be able to fool the tank's electronic systems with a Chaff Grenade.
0x353: You're incredible, Snake! You singlehandedly beat an M1 tank.
0x39e: No big deal. But I'll bet that VR simulator you trained on didn't have any scenarios that put you one on one against a tank, did it?
0x436: No. But there was no scenario where I had to work alone with a special forces soldier against a group of terrorists either.
0x4c5: In real life, things never go the way you expect them to...especially on a battlefield.
0x52d: I'm already holed up in the Warhead Storage Building. It looks like Dr. Emmerich is still fine, but I'm not sure for how much longer...
0x5d4: Hurry up this way, okay?
0x659: Deepthroat? No, I don't know anyone who calls himself that.
0x6a2: I see...
0x6b5: I wonder why he's trying to help you.
0x6e5: I have no idea.
0x6ff: A trap?
0x711: Could be. But for the time being, I'll have to trust him...
0x783: Where are the remote controlled missiles?
0x7ed: I think the remote controlled missiles are on the 1st floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0x884: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held in his lab in the northeast part of that floor.
0x8e8: They've flooded the area with gas to prevent him from escaping.
0x954: But there should be a gas mask on that floor too. If you use it, you'll be able to make it through easily.
0x9fb: Snake, Dr. Emmerich is being held just north of there.
0xa91: Dr. Emmerich should be in the laboratory area in the 2nd floor basement.
0xafc: He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north.
0xbab: Meryl, what are these holes in the walls for?
0xbe6: That's an air cleaner for blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.
0xd28: Who are you?
0xd3f: I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there.
0xd92: The one from the prison...?
0xdb8: You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?
0xdef: ......No...it's not him...
0xe14: Just exactly who are you?
0xe38: I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess.
0xe98: You came by yourself?
0xeb8: You think you're some kind of one-man army?
0xf10: You're not even armed.
0xf31: I appreciate your help from before. But...
0xf77: I don't need lectures.
0xf98: You're just like your uncle, you know.
0xfc9: How do you know my uncle?
0xfed: We go way back.
0x1007: What's your name?
0x1023: My name's not important.
0x1046: Aha!
0x1055: Could you be Snake?
0x1073: Are you Solid Snake?
0x1092: That's what some people called me.
0x10bf: The legendary Solid Snake...! You!?
0x10f7: Sorry about before...
0x1117: I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys.
0x1154: But I knew you were.
0x1173: How?
0x118e: It's your eyes.
0x11a8: My eyes?
0x11bb: They're not soldier's eyes.
0x11e1: They're rookie's eyes, right?
0x1209: No, they're beautiful, compassionate eyes.
0x124d: Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.
0x128f: You trying to sweep me off my feet?
0x12c7: Don't worry. You'll land back on them once you meet me.
0x130c: The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid.
0x134d: I don't believe that.
0x1377: Why did you look so surprised when you saw my face?
0x13b8: Because you look just like him.
0x13e2: ...You mean the terrorists' leader, Liquid Snake?
0x1421: Yeah, you know him?
0x143f: You're not brothers, are you!?
0x1468: I have no family.
0x1484: So what's the deal then?
0x14a7: Who knows. Why don't you ask him?
0x14df: But first I want some information.
0x150c: You were involved in this exercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?
0x156f: I'm sorry. I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack.
0x15d6: That's okay.
0x15f7: But what is this place?
0x1619: I don't think it's just a nuclear weapons disposal facility...
0x1665: Boy oh boy...it's just like them!
0x1691: Nobody's told you anything, did they?
0x16c1: Okay...you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.
0x1715: This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech.
0x177a: This is a civilian base?
0x179d: Right. For the development of Metal Gear.
0x17d4: Colonel!
0x17e7: FOX-HOUND and the Next- Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead.
0x1870: Why FOX-HOUND?
0x1889: Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.
0x18e0: They figured they could help keep it all hush-hush.
0x1921: But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.
0x195e: Why just this time?
0x197c: I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program...that's what I heard anyway.
0x1a15: Hmmm...sounds kinda fishy...
0x1a3c: So what do you think the terrorists want?
0x1a73: Sorry, I'm not sure...
0x1a94: I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started...
0x1ae7: Oh yeah.
0x1afa: That's when he gave you detonation code override keys, right?
0x1b45: That's right.
0x1b5d: Amazing you were able to keep'em hidden from the guards.
0x1ba3: Well...women have more hiding places than men.
0x1bdf: Anyway, you met Baker, huh? How's he holding up?
0x1c1d: ...He's dead.
0x1c35: What!?
0x1c46: Heart attack.
0x1c5e: Same as the DARPA Chief...
0x1c8f: The Chief died from a heart attack too...?
0x1cc7: Yeah...Was either of them sick or anything?
0x1d00: No...not that I heard of.
0x1d24: Well I don't believe in coincidences.
0x1d54: Something funny's going on.
0x1d7a: Hmmm. Sounds like it.
0x1d9a: But I have no idea what.
0x1dbd: Me neither...yet.
0x1dd9: Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?
0x1e16: You mean Dr. Emmerich?
0x1e37: Yes. Is he still alive?
0x1e59: Probably. He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north.
0x1ee7: 2nd floor basement?
0x1f05: Yeah, that's where his lab is.
0x1f2e: I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program.
0x1f81: So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway...
0x1fc4: Then we'd better do something before he finishes.
0x2003: You're right.
0x201b: In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x2099: You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?
0x20d9: It won't be the first time...
0x2101: ..........
0x2116: What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?
0x2171: There's a cargo door on the 1st floor of this building that leads to the north.
0x21ce: What's the security level of the door there?
0x2208: Five, but it's okay...I've got a level five card.
0x2247: Well...
0x2259: I've got to go save the Doctor. You should go...
0x2297: I'm going with you!
0x22b5: No way.
0x22c7: You're still too green. I want you to hide somewhere.
0x230a: I'm not green.
0x2323: Oh yes you are.
0x235c: You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over!
0x23b1: Good luck doesn't last forever!
0x23fb: I don't know what happened. I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.
0x2451: I never had any problems in training...
0x2483: But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated...
0x24ee: Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different.
0x2547: Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed about being a soldier...
0x259e: Everyday of my life, I've trained my mind and body for the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now...
0x262a: So what now? You wanna quit?
0x2651: I can't quit.
0x2673: I can't allow myself to quit now.
0x269f: Listen, Meryl. Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.
0x26f2: Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.
0x2755: In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions...worst traits come out.
0x27a5: It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield.
0x27f4: But this isn't a war.
0x2814: It's a terrorist action.
0x2837: You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.
0x2875: The adrenaline in your blood stream is starting to thin out.
0x28bf: Just take it easy.
0x28dc: But I learned all about combat high at the academy...
0x291f: We'll talk about it later.
0x2944: For now, just think about keeping yourself alive.
0x29a3: If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff.
0x29ef: Okay, let me try to say this another way...
0x2a28: Stay the hell out of my way.
0x2a4f: You're a real bastard...
0x2a72: ...just like my uncle said.
0x2aa2: Ha ha. I told you.
0x2abf: The real me is no match for the legend.
0x2af4: It looks like you were right.
0x2b9e: Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl.
0x2bd3: We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.
0x2c04: Then we'll take care of the detonation code override.
0x2c47: Got ya.
0x2c59: But listen, I know this area better than you.
0x2c94: Call me if you have any questions.
0x2cc1: Be careful, okay?
0x2cdd: After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.
0x4e31: Snake?.....Don't be so impatient. Settle down. I need a little more time to get the cargo door open.
0x4ec4: I'll call you when I get the door open. Just wait a little. Okay?
0x4f71: If you use a gas mask, you should be able to survive that gas for a long time.
0x4fec: Where is the gas mask?
0x500d: On the 2nd floor basement of that building. So you'll have to go through there without one.
0x50c1: A cardboard box? I heard stories from my uncle, but I always thought he was pulling my leg...I...I've got no comment.
0x51bb: The place is mined? Well, if you use a Mine Detector, you'll be able to see the mines displayed on your radar.
0x526c: If you need a Mine Detector, there should be one on the 2nd floor of the tank hangar.
0x52fe: The cargo door's open already. If you exit there and go north, you'll get to the Warhead Storage Building where Dr. Emmerich is being held.
0x53bc: I'll head there now and wait for you. Hurry after me okay.
0x544b: Snake, did you lose your way? The cargo door is on the 1st floor.
0x54b9: Snake, where are you going? The Warhead Storage Building is north. I can't believe it... Solid Snake is lost.....
0x553e: I guess it's true, the reality really can't live up to the legend.
0x55ad: If you go north from there, you'll eventually come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0x5689: I'll go ahead and wait for you there.
0x56b9: Meryl.
0x56ca: What? Are you going to tell me to stay back cause I'm too green again?
0x571e: Nope. It's your decision. I can't stop you from doing what you want, but...
0x5777: But?
0x5786: Don't do anything stupid, okay?
0x57b0: Stupid? Boy...thanks for the great show of confidence...
0x57f6: Meryl....
0x580a: Anyway...I'll see you there.
0x5953: No matter how good you are, there's no way you can match up against an M1 tank. All you can do is try to take out the person in the driver's seat.
0x59f9: With grenades, you should be able to attack the soldier on top of the tank too.
0x6325: Heavy arms fire in that area is strictly prohibited. An explosion could cause nuclear material to leak from one or more of the warheads...
0x63c3: ...and that would be a very serious problem. Please be careful.
0x642f: It looks like they're equipped with gas masks.
0x646b: That's because they are not supposed to use heavy arms.
0x64b0: Ah. You mean they use chemical weapons, instead.
0x652a: Hurry! Dr. Emmerich is in danger!
0x657e: Ninja?
0x658f: I've never heard of any member of FOX-HOUND like that....but you're going to have to do something about him if you want to save Dr. Emmerich.
0x67f1: Meryl, this pile of corpses...is this your handiwork?
0x6834: No way!
0x6865: I didn't think so.
0x6882: Who could have done that?
0x68a6: You got me.
0x68bc: But he must be somewhere up ahead.
0x68e9: Then I guess you'll just have to go and find out.
0x8b23: Snake, if you walk on that floor normally, it'll make a lot of noise and the enemy will hear you. Try crawling.
0x964b: Snake, are you okay?
0x967d: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x96b0: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x96ed: Snake...
0x9706: DO NOT SAVE
0x9cc0: This warining should not appear!!
0x9d30: Don't give up!
0x9d5c: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x9d95: Win Snake! Win!
0x9dc2: Don't die, Snake!
0x9df1: Do it for me! Snake!
0x9e33: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x9e87: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x9f01: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x9fbc: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0xa050: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0xa0eb: How can I help, Snake?
0xa11f: Snake, just tell me. I'll do anything to help.
0xa16f: Snake, how are you holding up?
0xa1ab: Did you call, Snake?
0xa7fa: Please Snake, don't give up.
0xa834: Come back alive, Snake...
0xa86b: Snake, it's all up to you...
0xa8b2: ! Snake!
0xaba7: Sorry. The Soliton radar won't work in a narrow space.
0xac0a: Too much harmonic resonance. The radio waves produce interference and we can't analyze the topographic data.
0xac87: Try to hang on until you get to a more open space. Okay?
0xb2fe: Don't give up, Snake!
0xb33c: What can I do for you, Snake?
0xb377: What is it, Snake?
0xb3a7: You called, Snake?
0xb3d7: What's up, Snake?
0xbdab: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said The graveyards are full of indispensable men. 
0xbe11: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0xbe9b: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0xbeea: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0xbf51: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0xbffa: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0xc062: Well...I'll think about it.
0xc0c6: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0xc0f5: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Naomi said?
0xc155: "He that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death. Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0xc23b: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough. 
0xc2ae: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0xc303: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0xc394: Snake, like Shakespeare said Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content. 
0xc409: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0xc46e: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0xc4f4: Snake, in China they say You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath. Do you know what that means?
0xc58b: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0xc638: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0xc689: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0xc70f: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0xc779: You're watching everything?
0xc79f: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0xc7f5: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0xc83c: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0xc897: Snake, like Confucius said The cautious seldom err. 
0xc8dc: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0xc99f: Snake, have you ever heard the saying Friendly counsel cuts off many foes ?
0xc9fe: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0xca7a: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0xcb46: In my parents' homeland they say If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten. 
0xcbde: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0xcd93: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0xcded: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0xce3b: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0xce85: But you have no choice, Snake.
0xceae: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep putting things in my pocket.
0xcf41: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0xcf81: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0xcfc2: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions. 
0xd017: What's that supposed to mean?
0xd03f: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0xd0b8: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0xd8bd: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy. 
0xd91d: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0xd9b0: Snake, This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise. 
0xda09: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0xdac4: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0xdb03: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0xdb4a: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0xdb8d: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0xdbd1: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0xdc65: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0xdcc5: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0xdd39: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0xdd72: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0xddf3: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0xde58: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0xdebe: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0xdeef: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0xdf48: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0xdfa5: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0xe035: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0xe072: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0xe0ea: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0xe128: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0xe18e: You can say that again.
0xe1ce: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0xe200: Why do you ask?
0xe21a: I like to play fighting games.
0xe243: Games?
0xe254: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0xe2fd: Not a very good job, huh.
0xe321: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0xe389: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0xe3d6: I'm sorry...
0xe3ed: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0xe449: Okay, Snake...I understand. War's not a game.
0xe485: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0xe4f6: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0xe56d: In China, they say Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many. 
0xe5c5: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0xe67c: The Chinese say It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns. 
0xe6cd: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0xe74b: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0xe7be: There's a Chinese proverb The mind cannot be in two places at once. 
0xe813: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0xe891: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying. 
0xe924: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0xe955: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0xe9d9: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return. 
0xea5c: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your short retirement in Alaska, huh?
0xeae8: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts. 
0xeb6d: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0xec10: In China, they say Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow. 
0xec85: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0xed48: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself. 
0xed8b: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0xedff: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0xf707: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0xf742: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0xf7a5: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0xf81a: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0xf870: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0xf8ec: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0xf929: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0xf98d: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0xf9ef: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0xfa33: I don't know about that...
0xfa58: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0xfac7: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0xfafd: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0xfb4c: And how do I do that?
0xfb6c: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0xfbd0: Snake, in China they say When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals. 
0xfc3c: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0xfca6: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0xfcfe: In China, they say The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly. 
0xfd4e: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0xfdda: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0xfe6b: Snake, Leo Durocher said Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last. 
0xfec1: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0xff36: You should think about that, Snake.
0xff82: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0xffc8: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor. 
0x1001d: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x10084: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble. 
0x100d1: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x1013c: Snake, Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day. 
0x1019c: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x101c7: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x10240: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... 
0x1027d: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x102c4: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x109b5: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x109ec: Good luck, Snake.
0x10a1b: Be careful, Snake.
0x10a58: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x10e42: Look at the radar! It's picking up the DARPA chief. He's the green dot. Hurry and rescue him.
0x10f0f: Snake, you can't use your radar in that area. There's some kind of electronic jamming coming from there...I wonder what it is. Anyway, be careful.
0x17179: The DARPA Chief. Poor man...he has a heart attack right after you save him...
0x171f2: I'm getting a bad feeling about this, Snake. Maybe you should let me save your mission.
0x17b81: Snake, you can't use the radar because something's jamming it.
0x17bcd: And whatever's doing it is very close to you. Be careful!
0x1ddc8: Snake, you can't use your radar. It's confused by all of the radio interference. That ninja is giving off some kind of electrical energy!
0x1ef7b: Snake! That's a ladies bathroom!
0x1efa6: I know that. I saw Meryl come in here.
0x1efd7: So you went in after her!? Are you some kind of pervert!? I won't let you save your mission now!
0x1f048: Listen Mei Ling, this is the only place on this base that I can talk to Meryl alone!
0x1f0ad: Whatever, weirdo! Don't call me again!
0x1fa6f: She'll die if you leave her like that! Aren't you going to save her!?
0x1fac2: She's just bait...it's me they want. If I step out there, I'm going to get picked off and who's going to save Meryl then!?
0x1fb50: I'm hoping that as long as I don't fall for it, they'll leave Meryl alive.
0x1fba8: So you're just going to leave Meryl there? She's hurt!
0x1fbec: I know what I'm doing. Meryl understands too.
0x1fc28: That's horrible...
0x1fc45: You're right. It is horrible. But that's war. And the first rule of war is to stay alive.
0x20b2e: Snake, your Soliton radar...
0x20b55: I know. I can't use it in a narrow space like this, right?
0x20b9d: Right. I'm sorry.
0x20bb9: No reason to apologize. Even the greatest masterpiece has its flaws.
0x2bee1: Snake, wouldn't now be a good time to save your mission?
0x2bf5f: You haven't saved your mission in a long time anyway, right?
0x2bfb7: What's going on?
0x2bfd2: I'm not sure...I'm getting a bad feeling.
0x2c006: A bad feeling? Something you ate?
0x2c032: No, I'm serious...like a premonition or something...
0x2c9f9: You found out where the DARPA Chief is! With his nanomachine transmitter, he should show up as a green dot on your radar when you get close.
0x2ca99: Try to find him.
0x2e94c: Mei Ling, how can someone outside of this operation cut into my Codec?
0x2e9a0: You're talking about that guy calling himself Deepthroat. We were monitoring from here.
0x2ea08: What about it?
0x2ea21: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it. ...it's top secret information...
0x2eaba: Can you tell where he called from?
0x2eae7: I'm sorry. The signal is too weak to locate its source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on the base.
0x2fac2: Snake, there's an old Chinese saying A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar. 
0x2fb4d: Einstein said it another way. He said that only a life lived for others is worth living.
0x2fbb6: That's why I entered MIT instead of Princeton or Vassar like my friends.
0x2fc0c: I wanted to do applied physics, not just theoretical stuff. I wanted to make things for people.
0x2fc7c: The Soliton Radar System or the Codec System...I just wanted to make something that would be useful for people.
0x2fcff: I think that it was the same for Dr. Emmerich too.
0x2fd3f: But he was used like a tool...used to make a horrible killing machine.
0x2fd93: Maybe it would be better if engineers like us just stopped making things... I don't know.
0x30491: It's a good thing you hooked up with Meryl...
0x304cc: You should have seen the Colonel. He doesn't like to let it show cause he's the boss, but he was so happy he could barely contain himself.
0x3056a: I'm glad to hear that.
0x30c39: "The tongues of dying men enforce attention, like deep harmony. 
0x30c88: Snake, people don't normally lie with their dying breaths. I think he was telling the truth. Maybe you should believe him.
0x388e8: In China they say It's better to live ugly than to die beautiful. 
0x3893b: I think it's true. Once you're dead, you'll never have another chance to be happy. I can't understand people who want to die before their time.
0x389de: Please Snake...promise me that you'll come back alive.
0x390cf: Mei Ling, how's Naomi?
0x390f0: Huh? She's fine, I guess. What's up?
0x3911f: Oh...
0x3912f: What do you want, Snake? If you want to talk to Naomi, why don't you call her?
0x39198: Oh it's nothing...forget about it.
0x391c5: Strange guy...
0x39879: ...Naomi wasn't acting strangely or anything?
0x398b4: No...I just can't believe that Naomi's an enemy spy. I refuse to accept that.
0x3990f: I don't want to believe it either, but...
0x39943: Don't say it, Snake.
0x39ff6: Snake, Naomi's under arrest...
0x3a01f: What the hell is happening over there?
0x3a053: What's the Colonel thinking?
0x3a07a: Campbell is...
0x3a093: I'm sorry. I can't say any more.
0x3a0be: But please believe me. I'm here to help you. Until the end...
0x3afd0: Snake, there's nothing I can do to help you. All I can do is to cheer you on!
0x3b7ee: Mei Ling, I don't think I can go through all that again. Please save the mission.
0x3b850: Okay, Snake, I'll take care of it.
0x3b8af: Snake, they've placed the Colonel under arrest. I don't know what I should do. This will probably be your last save.
0x3b937: I'm going to miss those proverbs of yours.
0x3b982: Mei Ling, I have a favor to ask you.
0x3b9b1: Make a hard copy of all the Codec conversation data up to this point. I want some insurance.
0x3ba1e: Okay, Snake. Leave it to me.
0x3c077: Snake, please. Be safe...for me.
0x42c0c: Snake, are you okay? I feel so scared for you. It must be horrible.
0x42c5d: I've been through a lot worse. Believe me.
0x42c96: Wow. You really are a hero.
0x42cbc: It's a good thing the Codec is connected directly to your inner ear. You can contact us anytime.
0x42d2d: ...It's always nice to hear that you're all right.
0x42d89: Why don't you contact the Colonel? If anyone can think of a way out, it's him.
0x43464: Mei Ling...You must think I'm garbage...
0x4349a: ...Snake, don't blame yourself too much.
0x434d0: You just...
0x434e6: I just let them kill Meryl to save my own worthless hide!
0x4352d: Listen...in China, they have a saying...
0x43575: Forget it...I'll use my own words this time.
0x435af: Cheer up, Snake.
0x435ca: Don't listen to what he said. It's nothing but a bluff. I'm sure about that.
0x43624: I don't think he's the bluffing type...
0x43656: But, Snake. You have a job to do. Pull yourself together for the world's sake.
0x436b2: First, you've got to figure out how to get out of there.
0x4370d: Snake, listen to me!
0x4372c: You...you've got to pull yourself together, and get back to work.
0x4377b: You're right. I've sat here feeling sorry for myself long enough.
0x437ca: Thanks, Mei Ling...
0x47ad4: This is Snake.
0x47aed: Colonel, can you hear me?
0x47b11: Loud and clear.
0x47b2b: What's the situation, Snake?
0x47b52: Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.
0x47b97: Just as I expected.
0x47bb5: You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.
0x47bf3: But make sure nobody sees you.
0x47c1c: If you need to, contact me by Codec.
0x47c4b: The frequency is 140.85.
0x47c6e: When you want to use the Codec, push the Select Button.
0x47cb3: When we need to contact you, the Codec will beep.
0x47cf2: When you hear that noise, press the Select Button.
0x47d33: The Codec's receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your ear.
0x47d86: No one but you will be able to hear it.
0x47db8: Got it. Okay. I'm ready to go.
0x47de1: CAMPBELL
0x47e1f: It's Snake.
0x47e35: I'm in front of the disposal facility.
0x47e90: Excellent, Snake.
0x47eac: Age hasn't slowed you down one bit.
0x47eff: Thanks to the VR training I did on board the Discovery.
0x47f58: That took a long time.
0x47f79: I guess you're feeling a little rusty.
0x47faa: Don't worry.
0x47fc1: It's been a while but it's all coming back to me.
0x48022: How's that Sneaking Suit working out?
0x48052: I'm nice and dry, but it's a little hard to move.
0x48091: Bear with it. It's designed to prevent hypothermia.
0x480d2: This is Alaska, you know.
0x480f6: Take it easy, I'm grateful.
0x4811c: If it weren't for your suit and your shot, I would've turned into a popsicle out there.
0x48184: An anti-freezing peptide, Snake.
0x481af: All of the Genome Soldiers in this exercise are using it.
0x481f6: I see. I'm relieved to hear that. Already tested, huh?
0x4823a: By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?
0x4828f: Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.
0x482d9: The terrorist's radar should have already picked them up.
0x4833d: MEI LING
0x4835b: There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.
0x4839b: You've got to hurry!
0x483d9: Wow...,
0x483eb: he must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather.
0x4843a: Who's that?
0x4845a: Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.
0x4849d: This is Mei Ling. She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.
0x4850e: She designed your Codec as well as your Soliton radar system.
0x48559: Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.
0x485b6: Nice to meet you, Snake.
0x485d9: It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.
0x48634: What's wrong.
0x4864c: Nothing...
0x48661: I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...
0x486c0: ...cute.
0x486d3: You're just flattering me...
0x486fa: No, I'm serious.
0x48715: Well I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
0x48756: C'mon...
0x48769: I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...
0x487b4: But I'm surprised...
0x487d3: You're very frank for a trained killer.
0x48805: Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.
0x4884b: Yeah.
0x4885b: I'm looking forward to learning about the man behind the legend...
0x488b5: ...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system.
0x48e51: Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it.
0x48ee8: Yes. It gets jammed easily I'm afraid.
0x48f2d: Yes. It's all made from currently existing technology.
0x48f71: You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance. So be careful.
0x48feb: We'll be monitoring your movements by radar,...
0x49028: ...so contact us by Codec anytime you want.
0x49061: Got it. I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.
0x490a8: Seriously, Snake.
0x490c4: We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice.
0x49130: I'm also in charge of your mission data.
0x49163: Contact me if you want me to record your current status.
0x491a9: My frequency is 140.96.
0x491cb: It's a dedicated frequency for saving data. Don't forget it.
0x4923d: Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.
0x4927d: You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find.
0x492c7: I remember. First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here,
0x4930f: ...and then all my weapons are taken away.
0x49347: Imagine yourself put in that position.
0x4938c: Well, if you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me.
0x493f0: I'll hold you to that, Doctor.
0x49419: By the way, sorry to disappoint you, but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.
0x49483: How did you do that?
0x494a2: In my stomach.
0x494bb: Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids.
0x4951d: Cigarettes? How are those going to help you?
0x49557: You never know.
0x49b4b: Naomi, the Chief! What happened!?
0x49b77: I...I don't know.
0x49b93: It looked like a heart attack, but...
0x49beb: A heart attack? No...
0x49c0b: ...Colonel, are you hiding something from me?
0x49c46: Absolutely not. Snake, you've got to understand.
0x49c84: This op is security level Red.
0x49cad: You need the highest security clearance to get access to the complete file.
0x49d09: You want me to believe that you're in charge of this op, but you don't have complete access to the file!?
0x49d83: I told you. The Secretary of Defense is in operational control.
0x49dd0: I'm just here as your support...
0x49e10: Snake, we don't have time to debate.
0x49e3f: Get out of there and find President Baker!
0x49ead: Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.
0x49ee8: Is it from the nanomachines?
0x49f0f: No, Snake.
0x49f24: The nanomachines are functioning properly.
0x49f5c: So what was it?
0x49f76: It must have been psychometric interference coming from Psycho Mantis, FOX-HOUND's psychic.
0x49fe2: Think of it is a mental feedback loop.
0x4a013: So that was Mantis...?
0x4a07f: Colonel! Are you listening?
0x4a0a5: Now he's dead too!
0x4a0c2: ...I have no idea!
0x4a0df: Don't lie to me!
0x4a10e: It looked like another heart attack, but...
0x4a147: Some kind of poison!?
0x4a167: Well, there are lots of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.
0x4a1f2: But...
0x4a203: we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy.
0x4a243: Damn...!
0x4a26a: Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!
0x4a2a5: Can I trust her!?
0x4a2c1: ...More than you can trust me.
0x4a2ff: Get in contact with her.
0x4a336: ...Snake, there's a lot of electrical interference coming from there.
0x4a389: It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us, but normal transmission is probably impossible.
0x4a401: Try moving away from that area.
0x4a43f: Snake, get a hold of yourself...
0x4a488: Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing!?
0x4a4d6: A member of FOX-HOUND?
0x4a4f7: No...
0x4a507: Are you sure?
0x4a51f: Yes, we have no one like that in our unit.
0x4a557: ...Is that right?
0x4a587: Snake, I'm counting on you.
0x4a5d9: Snake, I unlocked the cargo door for you.
0x4a610: Thanks. Where are you?
0x4a631: Where - I - can - see - ya.
0x4a661: Don't move around too much.
0x4a687: Don't worry, I'm disguised in this enemy uniform.
0x4a6dc: You won't be for long with the way you walk.
0x4a716: What does that mean?
0x4a741: Oh,...nothing.
0x4a75a: Listen Snake, the cargo door is like an airlock.
0x4a798: It's equipped with infrared sensors. Be careful.
0x4a7d6: If an intruder is sensed, gas is released.
0x4a80f: Gas...
0x4a820: Okay, so we'll meet at the nuclear warhead storage building.
0x4a874: Wait! You said you'd stay put and be a good girl!
0x4a8b3: I changed my mind.
0x4a8d0: Don't get careless. That's when things always turn sour.
0x4a917: Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure out whether or not I'm cut out to be a soldier.
0x4a984: ...I gotta get my hands dirty.
0x4a9ad: These guys are professionals. You're gonna get yourself killed.
0x4a9fb: ...See ya there!
0x4aa42: Gray Fox...
0x4aa58: Colonel, that Ninja is Gray Fox.
0x4aa83: No doubt about it.
0x4aab4: Ridiculous.
0x4aaca: You of all people should know he died in Zanzibar...
0x4ab20: No. He should have died.
0x4ab43: ...but he didn't.
0x4abac: It happened before I joined FOX- HOUND's medical staff.
0x4abf1: They were using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments.
0x4ac50: I never heard that.
0x4ac82: It happened right after you retired...
0x4acb3: My predecessor, Dr. Clark, was in charge.
0x4acfe: Dr. Clark?
0x4ad3b: Yes. He started the gene therapy project.
0x4ad72: And where is he now?
0x4ad9b: He was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago.
0x4ade0: So what about this soldier?
0x4ae06: Apparently for their test subject, they decided to use the body of a soldier
0x4ae60: who was recovered after the fall of Zanzibar...
0x4ae9d: And that was Gray Fox?
0x4aed2: But he was already dead!
0x4af1d: Yes. But they revived him.
0x4af42: They fitted him with a prototype exoskeleton and kept him drugged for four years...
0x4afa6: while they experimented on him like a plaything.
0x4afee: Today's genome soldiers were born from those experiments.
0x4b05d: That's the sickest thing I ever heard...
0x4b0a4: They used him to test all sorts of gene therapy techniques.
0x4b0ed: ...Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
0x4b138: ...Because it's confidential information.
0x4b16c: Is that the only reason?
0x4b1c4: Naomi, what happened to Gray Fox after that?
0x4b212: The record says he died in the explosion.
0x4b25d: I see.
0x4b26e: But even if that ninja is Gray Fox, the question is why?
0x4b2b4: From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was.
0x4b2f4: Are you saying that he's just a mindless robot?
0x4b331: I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the death...
0x4b37f: ...we'll meet again, I know it.
0x4b3bd: So you'll fight again?
0x4b3e8: Until you kill him?
0x4b406: Hmmmm...
0x4b419: I'd rather not, but maybe that's what he wants...
0x4b499: Meryl, the engineer's okay.
0x4b4bf: That's a relief.
0x4b4e4: I want you to look after him.
0x4b50c: Where are you now?
0x4b529: Very close.
0x4b549: There she is! Over there!
0x4b56d: Oh no!
0x4b57e: Damn...they've spotted me!!
0x4b5c3: Meryl! What happened!
0x4b60f: Colonel, your niece is going to be okay.
0x4b64f: Thanks, Snake. I owe you one.
0x4b677: Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing should wear off, right Naomi?
0x4b6e9: Yes...
0x4b6fa: Why did you go so far out of your way to save her?
0x4b73a: For Campbell's sake?
0x4b759: ...or...
0x4b76c: ...maybe it's because you like her?
0x4b7a4: I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.
0x4b7f3: Oh really? Since when did anybody's death bother you so much?
0x4b852: Naomi! It's true that Snake has killed a lot of people,...
0x4b89a: ...that doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart.
0x4b8d5: It's okay, Colonel...she's right.
0x4b9a3: Meryl!
0x4b9c8: Damn!! Snake, it's a trap!
0x4b9ed: Sniper's trick to lure you out.
0x4ba17: The sniper's waiting for you to go and help Meryl so he can pick you off...Don't do it!
0x4ba93: It must be Sniper Wolf...
0x4bab7: FOX-HOUND's best shooter.
0x4badb: Snipers usually work in pairs, but this one's alone, huh?
0x4bb23: I know her.
0x4bb39: She can wait for hours, days or weeks. It doesn't matter to her.
0x4bb87: She's just watching and waiting for you to expose yourself.
0x4bbd0: Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long...
0x4bc0d: Snake, can you see Wolf from where you are?
0x4bc46: There's nowhere to hide between here and the tower...
0x4bc89: ...she must be on the 2nd floor of the tower.
0x4bcd8: If Wolf is in the Communications Tower, she can see you perfectly! It's the classic sniper's position!!
0x4bd51: At that distance you won't be able to hit her with a standard weapon either!
0x4bdab: You'll need a sniper rifle!!
0x4bddc: Colonel! Take it easy.
0x4be1c: I'm going to save Meryl no matter what it takes.
0x4be64: Okay...thanks.
0x4bea6: What's wrong, Naomi?
0x4bee4: ...I'm just surprised you're willing to sacrifice yourself...you've got the genes of a soldier, not a savior.
0x4bf62: Trying to say I'm only interested in saving my own skin?
0x4bfa8: I wouldn't go that far, but...
0x4bfd1: I don't know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care.
0x4c01e: I operate on instinct.
0x4c03f: Like an animal?
0x4c059: I'm going to save Meryl. I don't need an excuse.
0x4c098: Okay...
0x4c0aa: And I'm not doing it for someone else either.
0x4c0e5: I'm going to save Meryl for myself.
0x4c113: Colonel, don't worry!
0x4c147: Snake, thanks.
0x4c174: I understand.
0x4c18c: I'm sorry.
0x4c20b: I've been better...
0x4c23d: How's Meryl?
0x4c273: ...They've got her.
0x4c34a: Snake,...
0x4c35e: ...the government has decided not to give in to their demands.
0x4c3aa: We're trying to buy some more time.
0x4c3d8: C'mon Colonel,...
0x4c3f4: ...why don't you stop playing dumb?
0x4c422: I'm sorry about Meryl. But I want the lies to end now.
0x4c466: What are you talking about?
0x4c48c: Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead, wasn't it?
0x4c4fe: You knew it all along, didn't you?
0x4c556: Why did you try to hide it?
0x4c57c: ...I'm sorry...
0x4c596: Can't tell the grunts, huh...
0x4c5be: ...You've changed a lot.
0x4c5e1: Metal Gear...secret advanced nuclear weapons research...
0x4c627: Does the White House know about this? How deep does it go?
0x4c679: ...As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not been briefed about the Rex Project.
0x4c6ea: "Need to know basis , is that the idea?
0x4c720: These are sensitive times. Even sub- critical nuclear tests are causing quite a stir.
0x4c786: Plausible deniability, huh?
0x4c7ac: Yes.
0x4c7bb: And tomorrow, the President and his Russian counterpart are scheduled to sign the Start 3 Accord.
0x4c82d: I get it. That's the reason for the deadline.
0x4c87c: That's right, Snake.
0x4c89b: And that's why we can't let this terrorist attack go public.
0x4c8f9: We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.
0x4c94e: This has to do with the President's reputation and America's place as the dominant superpower.
0x4c9bd: So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?
0x4ca0b: Please Snake, just stop them...
0x4ca35: Why should I?
0x4ca4d: Because you're the only one who can.
0x4ca7c: In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead.
0x4cad1: I told you before. I don't know the details.
0x4cb0c: I don't believe you.
0x4cb4a: If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands?
0x4cb9f: Let them have Big Boss's remains.
0x4cbd5: You see...
0x4cbea: Or is there some reason that you can't do that?
0x4cc31: Something you haven't told me about...
0x4cc76: Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to eugenics experiments.
0x4ccdd: We don't want the existence of the genome army to go public.
0x4cd27: And that's the only reason?
0x4cd82: Huh! The hell with you!
0x4cdbb: The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me.
0x4ce1a: Poor man.
0x4ce38: But it's strange. He looks and smells like he's been dead for days.
0x4ce89: All his blood's been drained out too.
0x4cee1: Drained!?
0x4cf09: Maybe to slow down decomposition?
0x4cf59: But the Chief only died a few hours ago, right?
0x4cf96: Right.
0x4cfa7: But he's already started to decompose.
0x4cfdb: What could it all be about?
0x4d00b: Something in his blood that they wanted?
0x4d041: I doubt it. Just the nanomachines and the transmitter.
0x4d099: Did the Chief tell them his detonation code?
0x4d0d3: I'm afraid so. It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch.
0x4d137: Damn. Is there any way to prevent it?
0x4d167: It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.
0x4d1db: It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.
0x4d220: You have to unlock it with three special card keys.
0x4d261: And where are those keys?
0x4d285: I've got one of them. I don't know where the other two are.
0x4d2ce: Besides, I'm locked up here.
0x4d2f5: We've got no choice. Forget about the keys.
0x4d32f: Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.
0x4d373: I'm sorry to have to lay it all in your lap, but you're all I've got.
0x4d3c6: Bust out of there and get to the Communications Tower.
0x4d439: Also...
0x4d455: What?
0x4d465: I know it's asking a lot...
0x4d48b: Meryl, right?
0x4d4a3: Yeah...
0x4d4b5: I'll save her.
0x4d4ce: Thanks.
0x4d591: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x4d5bf: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x4d5f8: What can I say?
0x4d612: Anything.
0x4d6c3: I...I'm not a very good talker...
0x4d6ef: Please...
0x4d703: ...tell me about yourself.
0x4d732: Myself?
0x4d744: ...That's a tough one.
0x4d765: Any family?
0x4d785: ...That's not a happy topic for me.
0x4d7bd: I don't have any family...
0x4d7e2: No wait, there was a man who said he was my father...
0x4d825: Where is he?
0x4d83c: Dead.
0x4d860: ...by my own hand.
0x4d891: Big Boss.
0x4d8b9: What!? Big Boss!!? I had no idea.
0x4d8fc: There was no way you could.
0x4d922: It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago.
0x4d951: Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.
0x4d9af: So...is it true?
0x4d9ca: Was Big Boss really your father?
0x4d9f5: That's what he said...
0x4da16: That's all I know.
0x4da33: And you were able to kill him, knowing that?
0x4da6d: Yup.
0x4da95: He wanted it.
0x4dab7: Besides, some people just need killing...
0x4db02: That's patricide...!
0x4db3a: That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.
0x4db78: The one we share in common.
0x4dba1: Is that why you left FOX-HOUND?
0x4dbcb: Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska was the perfect place...
0x4dc34: ...Snake.
0x4dc5e: ...I didn't have a real family either.
0x4dc8f: Just a big brother who put me through school.
0x4dcca: We weren't even blood-related and he was much older than me.
0x4dd35: ...He's dead...
0x4dd83: ...is there a woman in your life?
0x4ddaf: After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.
0x4de05: Friends?
0x4de18: ...Roy Campbell...
0x4de53: Huh? You're still calling me friend?
0x4de96: Is that it?
0x4deac: No, there was another...
0x4decf: Frank Jaeger.
0x4df16: Big Boss's most trusted lieutenant
0x4df43: and the only member of FOX-HOUND ever to receive the codename Fox. 
0x4df97: ...Gray Fox.
0x4dfed: I learned a lot from him...
0x4e024: ...didn't you try to kill each other?
0x4e054: It's true. We did. In Zanzibar.
0x4e07e: But it was nothing personal.
0x4e0a5: ...we were just professionals on opposite sides, that's all.
0x4e0ef: And you still call yourself friends !?
0x4e123: Hard to believe?
0x4e13e: War is no reason to end a friendship.
0x4e16e: That's insane.
0x4e187: I first met him on the battlefield.
0x4e1b5: He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.
0x4e1f0: But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.
0x4e231: He was always so cool and precise. I was still green and he showed me the ropes.
0x4e292: You knew him well?
0x4e2af: No. We never talked about our personal lives.
0x4e2ea: Sort of an unwritten rule...
0x4e311: The next time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.
0x4e35b: We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.
0x4e394: I know it sounds strange to most people.
0x4e3ca: But we were just two soldiers doing our jobs.
0x4e40f: It's like a sport.
0x4e42c: Men and their games!
0x4e44b: You're like wild animals!
0x4e46f: You're right. We are animals.
0x4e497: So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?
0x4e4ea: I don't know.
0x4e502: It's your genes...they make you predisposed towards violence!
0x4e54d: You really like talking about genes, Naomi.
0x4e586: Why did you get into genetic research anyway?
0x4e5d7: ...I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like.
0x4e627: I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am.
0x4e688: So you studied about DNA?
0x4e6ac: Yeah. I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.
0x4e70b: I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information,
0x4e754: I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory.
0x4e79b: Memory is stored in DNA?
0x4e7be: We're not sure.
0x4e7d8: But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA.
0x4e861: So what about my fate?
0x4e882: You know my DNA sequence, don't you?
0x4e8c8: Your fate?
0x4e8dd: I...
0x4e8ec: ...I'm sorry. I have no idea.
0x4e914: Of course not.
0x4e92d: You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
0x4e9cf: You okay, Snake?
0x4ea09: Yeah...nothing new to report.
0x4ea45: Snake, is there anything I can do?
0x4ea7e: Yeah, my arm hurts...
0x4ea9e: ...Poor Snake.
0x4eab7: I'll increase the level of pain killers in your blood.
0x4eafb: Okay, but you can leave out the benzedrine.
0x4eb34: That stuff makes me too frisky.
0x4eb5e: I guess you're not feeling too bad after all.
0x4ebc7: Snake, put the controller up against your arm.
0x4ec13: Don't worry. It'll feel good.
0x4ec3b: Huh?
0x4ec4a: Okay, here I go.
0x4ec82: Ooooh.
0x4ec9d: How does that feel, Snake?
0x4ecc2: A little better?
0x4ecfc: I stimulated your muscle fibers with the nanomachine's cilia.
0x4ed47: That's about all I can do for you...
0x4eda9: I'm not the right guy. I can't save the world.
0x4edfa: What's wrong?
0x4ee12: I gave in to the pain...
0x4ee53: I'm sorry, Colonel.
0x4ee8f: I sacrificed Meryl to save myself...
0x4eed2: ...Snake..........
0x4eef9: She was a soldier. She knew the risks.
0x4ef2a: Battlefield casualties are always tragic, but they're an unavoidable part of war.
0x4efa1: Don't blame yourself.
0x4efc1: You still have a mission to do.
0x5050b: That was a close one, Snake.
0x50532: Ocelot...you'll pay for that...
0x50581: That Deepthroat's a real enigma. He's definitely from inside their ranks.
0x505d9: Is he an informer?
0x505f6: Maybe some kind of renegade?
0x5061d: I've got the feeling there's some other force at work here.
0x50694: Snake, about Meryl...
0x506b4: Colonel, I'm sorry...
0x506d4: Listen to me.
0x506ec: I wasn't able to protect her.
0x50757: Snake, it's okay.
0x50773: You did what you could, now let it rest.
0x507a6: Colonel...
0x507d9: Snake...she's a soldier.
0x507fc: She knows that prisoners are a part of war.
0x50844: She joined up of her own free will.
0x50872: I'm sure she was prepared for this.
0x508a0: No. You're wrong...
0x508c8: .....?
0x508d9: Meryl thought she had to become a soldier...thought it was the only way.
0x50932: She said she thought it would bring her closer to her dead father.
0x5098c: She said that!?
0x509a6: She wasn't ready for real combat.
0x509d2: I shouldn't have pushed her so hard. ...It's all my fault.
0x50a2e: That's not like you, Snake.
0x50a7c: Master? What is it?
0x50aae: Sorry for eavesdropping, but I just couldn't listen anymore.
0x50af9: Master...
0x50b0d: Snake, you can have regrets if you want to...it's only natural.
0x50b5a: But you can't keep attacking yourself for things that happened in the past.
0x50bb3: That road leads to madness, believe me.
0x50bfd: He's right. Don't kick yourself.
0x50c28: It doesn't suit a legend like you.
0x50c70: And besides that, for all we know Meryl's okay, right?
0x50cc6: I'm sure Meryl's just fine.
0x50cfa: Mei Ling...
0x50d24: Snake, forget about Meryl. Stop Liquid.
0x50d59: That's what Meryl would want, too.
0x50d9e: Meryl would say the same thing.
0x50df0: ...Snake?
0x50e14: Meryl...she's pretty special to you, huh?
0x50e4b: Yes, she's special.
0x50e69: There aren't many women like her around.
0x50e9f: ...That's not what I meant...
0x50ec7: She's the Colonel's niece. ...and a combat buddy.
0x50f10: Is that all? C'mon...
0x50f3a: ...This is like a police interrogation.
0x50f6c: No...I just...
0x50f99: I guess it's in the genes...
0x50fc0: The genes?
0x50fd5: What are you talking about, Colonel?
0x51004: No, I just remembered about Naomi's grandfather.
0x51042: I think Naomi said he rose as high as assistant secretary in the FBI during Edgar Hoover's time.
0x510b3: Is that right?
0x510ea: Yes...yes, he was Japanese and he became a special undercover investigator to nab the mafia.
0x5116b: When was that?
0x51198: Oh...sometime in the 50's, I guess.
0x511da: Where?
0x511ff: ...New York, I think...
0x5123f: Naomi...I thought that you didn't have any family...
0x51295: Well...I...I researched it after I became an adult.
0x512d6: My grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.
0x51324: I never even had the chance to meet him...
0x51394: ...Snake, good luck.
0x513c7: Watch your back, Snake.
0x51464: 7 OTACON
0x51494: Snake, the elevator's working.
0x514bd: You fixed it?
0x514d5: No, that's the weird thing.
0x514fb: It just moved by itself. It's headed your way now.
0x5153c: Is that so? Okay.
0x51558: That explosion before...what was it?
0x51587: Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.
0x515b8: Helicopter? That's incredible, Snake!
0x515eb: Listen. I just want to make sure again.
0x51627: This is the way to get to where Metal Gear is being stored?
0x51670: Yeah. The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards the back of the snowfield ahead.
0x516e6: Okay. Find a safe place to hide out for a while.
0x51727: I'm going underground.
0x51748: I know, I know. You don't have to tell me.
0x51780: And stay outta my way. Don't try to be a hero or anything.
0x517c9: Okay, call me if you need to.
0x5182d: Snake, there's something I forgot to tell you before.
0x51880: There were five stealth camouflage prototypes in my lab.
0x518c6: Yeah, so?
0x518da: If you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four.
0x5191e: Hey. This isn't first grade math class.
0x51950: I thought I'd get one for you, so I went back to the lab and...
0x5199e: Yeah?
0x519b8: The four suits were missing.
0x519df: .........?
0x519f4: Also...about the elevator that I checked out...
0x51a31: It's really strange.
0x51a50: It was like someone was intentionally holding it.
0x51a8f: When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off?
0x51add: That's another thing that bothered me about it...
0x51b1c: The warning went off and I know I couldn't be over the limit.
0x51b67: How much do you weigh?
0x51b88: About 135.
0x51b9d: But that elevator had a weight limit of 650 pounds.
0x51bde: It would take at least five people to go over that limit...
0x51c27: L...Look out, Snake!
0x51c46: The guys who stole my stealth prototypes are in there with you!!!
0x51d0f: Snake!! Are you okay!?
0x51d30: Otacon! Were there any other stealth prototypes?
0x51d71: No. There were only five.
0x51d95: So...this isn't stealth camouflage then...
0x51df0: Someone's aiming at me...
0x51e14: ...in the middle of this blizzard...
0x51e46: ...It's her!!
0x51e5e: Wolf?
0x51e6e: ...Sniper Wolf?
0x51e88: Yes it's her!
0x51ea0: ...It's definitely her!
0x51ec2: Otacon... You sound like you're happy.
0x51ef6: No I'm not.
0x51f0c: So then what is it?
0x51f47: ...please don't kill her!
0x51f6b: Are you insane!?
0x51f86: Please. She's a good person!
0x51fad: You'd know that if you talked to her...
0x51fdf: Listen to me, kid. She's a merciless killer.
0x52037: I can see you perfectly from here.
0x520dc: I told you...
0x520f4: I'd never quit the hunt. Now you're mine.
0x52140: Wolf! No, you can't!
0x52173: Don't get between a wolf and its prey!
0x521a4: You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.
0x521e5: You see?
0x52202: Women naturally make better soldiers.
0x52246: Wolf! Don't do this!!
0x5227a: Snake, I'm near.
0x52295: Can't you sense me near you?
0x522bc: It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.
0x5232a: Well I'm going to send you a love letter, my dear.
0x5236a: Do you know what that is? It's a bullet straight from my gun to your heart.
0x523d7: Please!! Wolf!...Snake!...No!
0x52413: Quiet!
0x52424: Don't get in our way!
0x52444: Now I'm gonna pay you back for Meryl...
0x52479: You men are so weak.
0x52498: You can never finish what you start...
0x5252a: Snake.
0x52547: I've got something to tell you about Naomi Hunter.
0x52587: What about her?
0x525a1: Is this conversation secure?
0x525df: The monitor's off.
0x525fc: Okay.
0x5260c: What's up?
0x52621: I was in the FBI too, y'know.
0x52649: I didn't know that. What's your point?
0x5267a: Dr. Hunter's story about her background...
0x526b2: ...about her grandfather being an assistant secretary to Hoover in the FBI...
0x52720: And then going undercover to investigate the mafia in New York..
0x5276e: Yeah, what about it?
0x5278d: It was all a big lie.
0x527b7: What did you say?
0x527d3: It was really bothering me.
0x527f9: Why would she lie about it?
0x5281f: She lied?
0x52833: She might be a spy!
0x52867: C'mon. Even a high school student could see past it.
0x528a9: The head of the FBI at that time, Edgar Hoover...he was a well-known racist.
0x52906: Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese?
0x52954: Well back then there wasn't a single Asian investigator.
0x5299a: Also, in the 1950's the undercover mafia sting operations hadn't even started yet.
0x529fd: They first started in 1960...in Chicago, not New York.
0x52a52: You better check it out.
0x52a75: The chief and the president mysteriously dying, that ninja...too many strange things are happening.
0x52ae9: Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?
0x52b3c: Either that or she's working with the terrorists.
0x52b7b: ...Could it be?
0x52b95: If I find out anything, I'll call.
0x52bc2: In the meantime, be careful!
0x52c15: Snake, it's me...
0x52c31: Master?
0x52c43: It's about Naomi.
0x52c5f: Turn your monitor off...
0x52c96: What about Naomi?
0x52cda: Damn!
0x52cea: Colonel, is Naomi there?
0x52d21: No she's away.
0x52d3a: She's taking a short nap.
0x52d5e: Hmmm...
0x52d70: So what is this about Naomi?
0x52dbb: Maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this too.
0x52df9: Yeah...go on Master.
0x52e18: Well basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at all.
0x52eb3: I thought her story of her background sounded kind of fishy, so I checked it out.
0x52f29: And...?
0x52f4f: There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter, or I should say there was one...
0x52fa2: But she's not the woman we know.
0x52fd7: The real Naomi Hunter disappeared somewhere in the Middle East.
0x53024: Our Naomi must have somehow obtained her identification papers.
0x53085: So then who is she really?
0x530be: She must be some kind of...spy.
0x53110: A spy!?
0x53136: Yes...maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation.
0x53199: Are you saying she's with the terrorists?
0x531d0: ...I don't want to believe it either.
0x53200: But she is working for FOX-HOUND...
0x5322e: So you think she had a part in the uprising?
0x5327c: Or she could be working with some different group altogether.
0x532e7: Different group...?
0x53305: It couldn't be...
0x5333f: Place her under arrest.
0x53389: What!
0x533ad: She's betrayed us.
0x533ca: She needs to be arrested and interrogated to find out who she's with.
0x53445: If she's one of their spies, then we're in big trouble...
0x53497: What do you mean!?
0x534be: Oh nothing...
0x534ea: Have you let her in on some kind of vital secret or something?
0x53587: Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths of the DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president?
0x53627: I...I have no idea.
0x53663: Anyway, we cannot allow her to participate any further in this mission.
0x536e0: Wait, wait a minute.
0x536ff: Without her, we can't complete this mission.
0x53739: I knew it. You're hiding something.
0x53767: Give me some time.
0x53784: I'll try to get it out of her...
0x537c3: Hurry then.
0x537d9: We've got to figure out who she is and what she's doing here.
0x53850: Snake, give me some time.
0x53874: I don't have any time left for you.
0x5394d: Snake...it's me.
0x53980: Did you find a good place to hide?
0x539ad: Yeah, thanks to the stealth gear.
0x539e5: It looks like they've finished getting Metal Gear ready.
0x53a2b: How do you know that?
0x53a4b: I overheard them talking.
0x53a8c: Right in front of Metal Gear. ...but it's strange.
0x53acc: What is?
0x53adf: There's nobody here...
0x53b00: ...no guards, nobody patrolling...
0x53b2d: ...it's too quiet.
0x53b4a: Maybe because they're all ready.
0x53b75: They said they even input the PAL codes.
0x53bab: What should I do?
0x53bc7: All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told you about.
0x53c25: But I've only got one of the three keys.
0x53c58: And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys...
0x53cb1: Leave it to me...
0x53ccd: You got some kind of plan?
0x53cf2: Well, I'm in the computer room right now.
0x53d29: I'm trying to access Baker's private files.
0x53d62: Baker's files?
0x53d7b: Don't you need a password?
0x53da0: Of course. But there are ways...
0x53dd5: Are you a hacker?
0x53dfb: Yup. That describes me pretty well.
0x53e2c: Does it look like you can get in?
0x53e58: I don't know yet.
0x53e74: I'll give it a try.
0x53e92: I'm counting on you...
0x53f6e: Snake...it's me again.
0x53f9b: How's it going?
0x53fb5: Hmmm...not bad.
0x53fcf: I just got past his 3rd security level.
0x54001: He was a pretty careful guy.
0x54028: Do you think you'll break in soon?
0x54055: I've never met a system I couldn't bust into.
0x54090: Okay, keep trying...
0x5415a: Snake, I did it!
0x5417f: You got past security?
0x541a0: Bingo!!!
0x541b3: Great! So whaddya got?
0x541d4: I accessed the confidential Metal Gear file.
0x5420e: So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about?
0x5425a: I haven't found it yet...
0x5427e: That's what I need to know!
0x542a4: But Snake, I found something else!
0x542eb: The secret behind the new nuclear weapon!
0x5432c: Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun like a projectile...
0x543a2: It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't considered a missile.
0x543e6: That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties.
0x54433: Pretty sneaky.
0x5444c: Yes, but effective.
0x5446a: And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon.
0x544b1: I can't wait to hear this.
0x544d6: It's a stealth weapon!
0x54501: You mean it won't show up on radar?
0x5453f: The truth is...they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's.
0x5459a: Why weren't they able to develop one up until now?
0x545da: Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system...it will be picked up by enemy satellites.
0x54648: Oh yeah, that makes sense.
0x5466d: But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellent.
0x546ba: So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems.
0x54713: An invisible nuclear warhead...
0x5473d: Totally impossible to intercept.
0x54768: And on top of that it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases.
0x547e4: We learned that lesson in the Gulf War.
0x54819: This thing could mean the end of the world!
0x54852: It's the ultimate weapon.
0x54876: And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.
0x548ee: Colonel, is this true? Are you listening?
0x5494f: I'm listening...
0x5496a: If word of this got out,
0x5498d: it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident.
0x54a0b: Yeah, it would be nasty.
0x54a2e: The United States would be denounced by the U.N...it could even bring the President down...
0x54a9a: Did you know this, Colonel!?
0x54af6: You've changed, Colonel...
0x54b1b: I won't make any excuses...
0x54b55: Snake, listen to me.
0x54b74: This new nuclear weapon...it's never actually been tested, only simulated.
0x54bcc: You mean they ran a computer model?
0x54bfa: Yeah, that's why they were conducting this exercise.
0x54c3c: They needed to get actual experimental data to back up the simulation.
0x54c93: What were the results of the exercise?
0x54cc4: It looks like it went better than they hoped for. But...
0x54d0a: I can't find the data anywhere on this network.
0x54d47: You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded...
0x54d9e: It was. President Baker gave me an optical disk with all of the test data.
0x54e1e: What!? Do you still have it?
0x54e45: No. Ocelot took it from me.
0x54e75: Damn...
0x54e9b: The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead.
0x54eec: Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch.
0x54f3f: So you think they can do it?
0x54f66: Well, the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so.
0x54fcd: Did you find out how to override it yet?
0x55000: Not yet. It must be in a separate file.
0x55035: Right now I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files.
0x5507f: We're counting on you...
0x5514d: Snake?
0x5515e: Did you find it?
0x55179: No, I haven't found out about the override system yet, but I found Baker's ulterior motive.
0x551e5: He's just looking to get rich, isn't he?
0x55218: That's part of it. ArmsTech is in much worse financial trouble than I thought.
0x55274: I know they lost their bid to make the next generation fighter jet. That plus the reduction in SDI spending...
0x552f3: It looks like there was even some talk of a hostile takeover.
0x5533e: Everything was riding on this project, I guess.
0x5537b: And it looks like we were paying a lot of bribe money to the DARPA Chief.
0x553d2: Bribe money, huh.
0x553ee: Yeah, and Baker was a big proponent of the nuclear deterrent theory.
0x55440: I see... So anyway, what about the override?
0x5547a: Just give me a little bit longer...
0x5556d: Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!
0x555a3: Great job.
0x555b8: How's it going there?
0x555d8: They've finished inputting the PAL codes.
0x5560f: So how do we deactivate them?
0x55637: Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about...
0x5568d: It can also be used to input the detonation codes.
0x556cd: Y'see, if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it.
0x55727: And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated.
0x55775: And you can only use the keys once.
0x557a3: Only once, huh.
0x557bd: Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time.
0x55804: But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!
0x5584d: Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick.
0x55884: You already have all three keys!
0x558af: What are you talking about!?
0x558d6: The card key is made of a shape memory alloy.
0x55911: Shape memory alloy?
0x5592f: Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures.
0x5597f: The key is made out of it!
0x559a4: This card key?
0x559bd: Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures.
0x55a13: So this key is actually three keys in one...clever.
0x55a80: Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter...
0x55aac: Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it.
0x55af4: Turn your monitor off.
0x55b15: Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead.
0x55b54: Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear.
0x55b8f: Okay, so what's up?
0x55bad: I've got a good friend in the Pentagon...
0x55bf6: He's the one who told me about it...
0x55c25: It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of assassination weapon.
0x55c82: An assassination weapon?
0x55ca5: Snake, have you ever heard of something called FoxDie ?
0x55d07: FoxDie?
0x55d19: ...Liquid and the others were talking about it...
0x55d58: Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people.
0x55da1: I don't know all the details, but...
0x55dd0: What are you trying to say?
0x55df6: It's too similar.
0x55e12: What is!?
0x55e26: The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,...
0x55e96: ...die of something that looked like a heart attack?
0x55ed8: Yeah...?
0x55eeb: Well, apparently FoxDie kills its victims by simulating a heart attack.
0x55f55: ...No...You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?
0x55f96: Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?
0x55fe6: ...The nanomachines.
0x56005: She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was.
0x56069: ...Does the Colonel know?
0x5608d: I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her.
0x560cc: Okay. I'll ask him myself.
0x560fd: Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?
0x56160: I just placed Naomi under arrest.
0x56196: Arrest?
0x561a8: She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base.
0x561ee: I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists.
0x5625d: I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now.
0x56297: What kind of interrogation?
0x562bd: Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here.
0x56329: Call me if you find out anything.
0x56369: So it's true, isn't it?
0x5638b: Naomi...I can't believe it.
0x563b1: That means the FoxDie vaccine must be around somewhere.
0x563f6: Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about.
0x56432: But Snake...you might be infected too, you know.
0x56470: All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel.
0x564df: Snake, can you hear me?
0x56501: It's Naomi...
0x56523: Naomi!?
0x56535: ...what the hell!?
0x56552: Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different Codec.
0x565a6: Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?
0x565d6: ...Yes.
0x565e8: But not everything I said was a lie.
0x56638: I don't know myself.
0x56657: I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.
0x566ad: I bought all my identification.
0x566d7: But my reason for getting into genetics was true.
0x56716: Cause you want to know yourself, right?
0x5674b: That's right. I want to know where I came from...m, my age, my race... ...anything.
0x567af: Naomi...
0x567c2: I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's...
0x56809: ...a dirty little orphan...
0x56843: Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?
0x56878: Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.
0x56903: That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that...
0x56967: Naomi, you're too worried about the past.
0x5699e: Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?
0x569e4: Understand who I am now!?
0x56a08: Why should I? No one else tries to understand me.
0x56a47: I was alone for so long...
0x56a76: ...until I met my big brother and him. 
0x56aab: Your big brother?
0x56b15: He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi River.
0x56b67: I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations with me.
0x56bc2: Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my only family.
0x56c33: Gray Fox?
0x56c47: We survived that hell together, Frank and I.
0x56c81: He protected me.
0x56c9c: He's my one connection...
0x56cc0: ...the only connection that I have to my past.
0x56cfc: And he brought you back to America?
0x56d2a: No.
0x56d38: I was in Mozambique when he came.
0x56d68: Who is he ?
0x56d81: ...You mean Big Boss?
0x56db0: He brought us to this land of freedom , this America.
0x56df7: But then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.
0x56e52: And that's when it happened...
0x56e85: You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.
0x56ecf: I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.
0x56f02: I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I would...
0x56f64: So were your prayers answered?
0x56fa3: Yes. I waited two long years...
0x56fd7: To kill me?
0x56fed: Is that all you cared about?
0x57014: Yes. That's right.
0x5704f: Two years.
0x57064: You were all I thought about for two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession...
0x570cd: Do you still hate me?
0x570f7: ...Not exactly.
0x57111: I was partly wrong about you...
0x5713b: What about Liquid and the others?
0x57171: No. I'll have my revenge on them too.
0x571a4: Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?
0x571e3: The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments...
0x57248: ...No...that was my brother.
0x5726f: Afterwards I covered it up and helped him hide out...
0x572be: So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox...
0x572eb: ...he's come here to kill me?
0x57313: ...I don't think so.
0x57332: I think he just came here to fight you...
0x57366: I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.
0x573a7: A final battle with you...
0x573d6: ...that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it...
0x5740e: ...Fox...no...
0x57445: Naomi, tell me something...
0x5746b: ...about FoxDie?
0x5749c: FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.
0x574f5: First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.
0x5753a: FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through protein engineering.
0x5758f: They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells.
0x575e5: Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?
0x5761c: Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.
0x576a0: It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.
0x576eb: The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells.
0x57778: And then...they cause a heart attack?
0x577a8: The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then...
0x57815: ...the victim dies.
0x57833: Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide...
0x57883: ...Naomi...
0x57899: ...What?
0x578ac: ...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right?
0x5792a: Do I still have time?
0x5795f: Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.
0x5799a: But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do.
0x579d6: Listen, Snake.
0x579ef: ...I'm not the one who made the decision to use FoxDie.
0x57a43: You weren't?
0x57a90: You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation.
0x57ad8: I just wanted to let you know that...
0x57b12: ...No, that's not the whole truth...
0x57b50: The real thing that I wanted to tell you was...
0x57b8d: Snake, I...I...
0x57bbb: Hey! What are you doing!?
0x57bdf: Eeeek!!
0x57bf1: Ooooh....
0x57c05: Snake.....
0x57c2c: ...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.
0x57c94: Naomi's been removed from this operation.
0x57ccb: What happened to Naomi!?
0x57cee: What did she mean when she said that FoxDie was a part of this operation!?
0x57d49: Colonel, let me talk to her!
0x57d70: I won't. She's under arrest.
0x57dac: ...you double crossed me!
0x57dd0: Snake, there's no time for that!
0x57dfb: Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear!
0x57e32: ...Okay, Snake!?
0x57ea2: Thank you, Snake.
0x57ebe: Now the detonation code is completed.
0x57ef1: Nothing can stop Metal Gear now.
0x57f1c: Master, what's going on?
0x57f3f: You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.
0x57fba: Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.
0x58033: We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.
0x58071: Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.
0x580bc: Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.
0x58107: In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.
0x5817f: Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met.
0x581d4: What do you mean?
0x581f0: Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way.
0x5823b: That's when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.
0x58290: First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.
0x582db: So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.
0x5832e: Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie.
0x58390: You mean you had this planned from the beginning?
0x583cf: Just to get me to input the detonation code!?
0x5840a: Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?
0x58458: Who the hell are you!?
0x58479: In any case, the launch preparations are complete.
0x584b9: Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon,
0x584f8: the White House will have no choice but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine to me.
0x58557: Their ace-in-the-hole is useless now...
0x58589: Ace-in-the-hole?
0x585a4: The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful...
0x585ea: ...in the torture room.
0x58606: l"j!
0x5868e: Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.
0x586c8: Poor fool.
0x586dd: Who are you anyway!?
0x586fc: I'll tell you everything you want to know.
0x58734: If you come to where I am, that is.
0x58762: Where are you?
0x5877b: Very close by.
0x587a8: Snake, that's not Master Miller!
0x587e7: Campbell, you're too late.
0x58820: Master Miller's body was just discovered at his home.
0x58863: He's been dead for at least three days.
0x58898: I didn't know because my Codec link with Master was cut off.
0x588e2: But Mei Ling said his transmission signal was coming from inside the base!
0x5893d: So who is it?
0x58955: Snake, you've been talking to...
0x58994: ...Me...
0x589a7: ...dear brother.
0x589cc: Liquid!? How the...!?
0x589ec: You've served your purpose.
0x58a12: You may die now!
0x58a78: Colonel! Can you hear me?
0x58a9c: Yes...I'm listening.
0x58abb: What is the Pentagon trying to do!?
0x58ae9: Colonel! Answer me!
0x58b07: The Secretary of Defense has taken over active control of this operation.
0x58b5e: He's on his way there by AWACS.
0x58b88: What for?
0x58b9c: To bomb the place.
0x58bca: Not only that.
0x58be3: B-2 Bombers just lifted off from Galena Airforce Base.
0x58c27: They're carrying B61-13 surface- piercing tactical nuclear bombs.
0x58c76: What!? Metal Gear is destroyed. Tell the Secretary of Defense!
0x58cc2: The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us and he's worried about FoxDie.
0x58d2d: Now that there's no more danger of a nuclear strike from Metal Gear,
0x58d7f: he's going to do whatever's necessary to cover up the truth of what really happened here.
0x58de9: He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence along with anyone who knows anything...
0x58e6a: Don't worry, Snake.
0x58e88: I'll stop the nuclear strike.
0x58ebf: I may only be a figurehead here, but I'm still officially in command of this mission.
0x58f25: If I issue an order to delay the strike, it'll confuse the chain of command and at least buy you some time.
0x58fa1: It'll give you a chance to escape!
0x58fce: But Colonel, if you do that...
0x58ff7: It's okay, Snake.
0x59013: ...The truth is FOX-HOUND was already the subject of an undercover investigation.
0x59075: Meryl was transferred to this base just before the terrorist attack...
0x590c9: ...as a way of manipulating me.
0x59102: Those bastards...
0x59147: They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.
0x5918a: You'd better get out of there, Snake.
0x591d2: ...It'll be bad for you.
0x5920c: It's the least I can do for you after all the lies.
0x59262: I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run.
0x5929c: After that there's no turning back...
0x592e0: Aaaah! What are you doing!?
0x59310: Snake!
0x5933f: Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel!?
0x59375: ...I don't believe it!!
0x59397: What happened!?
0x593b1: Snake, the Colonel...!!
0x593fd: Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty.
0x59432: This is the Secretary of Defense, Jim Houseman.
0x5946f: Put the Colonel back on!
0x59492: He's been placed under arrest for leaking top-secret information and for the crime of high treason.
0x59506: Ridiculous!
0x5951c: Yes, he's a ridiculous man.
0x59542: He truly believed that he was in command of this operation.
0x5958b: You bastard...!
0x595a5: There won't be a speck of evidence left.
0x595db: I'm sure the President would want the same thing.
0x5961a: The President ordered this?
0x59640: The President is a busy man.
0x59667: I have complete authority here.
0x59691: How do you plan on explaining a nuclear attack on Alaska to the media?
0x596fc: We've prepared a convincing cover story.
0x59732: We'll simply say that the terrorists exploded a nuclear device.
0x5977f: ...Smart.
0x59793: You'll be murdering everyone here. The scientists, the Genome Army, everyone...
0x597f3: Donald...
0x59807: ...the DARPA Chief is already dead...
0x59837: So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA Chief after all?
0x5987a: He was my friend.
0x59896: And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh?
0x598e6: Well, if you give me the optic disc, I might consider saving them.
0x5995c: Metal Gear's test data!
0x5997e: Donald was supposed to bring it back.
0x599ae: I don't have it.
0x599c9: I see. Oh well that's okay...
0x599f4: You two are an embarrassment from the 1970's.
0x59a2f: ...our country's dirty little secret.
0x59a5f: You can't be allowed to live.
0x59a87: Well, the bombs will be dropping soon, and you two have a lot of catching up to do.
0x59aeb: Farewell.
0x59b2b: Snake, it's me.
0x59b45: Otacon, good news.
0x59b62: Meryl's okay.
0x59b7a: All right!!!
0x59b91: You saved her, man. Good job!
0x59bb9: I got some bad news too.
0x59be6: We're about to be bombed.
0x59c0a: Oh boy. I guess we're considered expendable.
0x59c44: Is there a way out of here?
0x59c6a: A way out?
0x59c7f: ...Uh, yeah.
0x59c96: You can take the loading tunnel to the surface.
0x59cd3: There's a parking garage right next to you.
0x59d0c: The tunnel leads from there to the surface.
0x59d45: The door in front?
0x59d62: No. It's a small entrance to the west of that door.
0x59da3: How about the security?
0x59dc5: I just unlocked it.
0x59de3: Who do you think you're talking to?
0x59e11: I'll take care of security along your escape route too...
0x59e58: What are you going to do?
0x59e7c: Me?
0x59e99: I'll stay here.
0x59eb3: Are you crazy!
0x59ecc: I need a little more time to take care of your escape route.
0x59f27: Unlocking the security doors is difficult work. Only I can do it.
0x59f83: Otacon?
0x59fac: I'm staying here. It's my own decision.
0x59fe1: Otacon, this is a hardened shelter, but they're going to use a surface piercing nuclear bomb.
0x5a04f: It won't hold.
0x5a068: I'm through regretting the past...
0x5a095: Life isn't all about loss, y'know...
0x5a0d9: Snake, I'm a complete person now.
0x5a105: I've found a reason to live.
0x5a12c: Good.
0x5a13c: Don't die on me.
0x5a157: Same to you.
0x5a16e: Take care of Meryl, okay.
0x5a192: I will...
0x5a1a6: Okay I gotta go.
0x5a1c1: I promise I'll do something about your escape route.
0x5a216: "Thanks ...
0x5a22d: ...oh, that sounds nice.
0x5a250: ...I believe in you.
0x5a26f: Thanks, Snake.
0x5a310: Are you okay?
0x5a328: Colonel, what happened?
0x5a34a: The Secretary of Defense has been arrested.
0x5a383: Early retirement.
0x5a3a9: Arrested?
0x5a3bd: I was able to get into contact with the President.
0x5a3fd: Metal Gear, the training exercise... all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.
0x5a470: Acting alone?
0x5a488: What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?
0x5a4cb: The orders were rescinded.
0x5a4f0: The F117s and the B2 Spirits have returned to the base.
0x5a53f: Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.
0x5a59a: Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few secrets.
0x5a5ee: I wonder about that.
0x5a60d: In any case, the danger's over...
0x5a652: Colonel, you can rest easy.
0x5a678: Meryl's fine.
0x5a690: Really?
0x5a6a2: Thanks...
0x5a6b6: ...Thank you, Snake.
0x5a6f2: I'm sorry I...
0x5a70b: ...I kept a lot of things from you.
0x5a739: It's okay, Colonel.
0x5a757: Snake,
0x5a768: I'm not a Colonel.
0x5a785: Oh that's right.
0x5a7a0: I've got a present for you.
0x5a7c6: There's a snowmobile close to you.
0x5a7f3: Mei Ling saw it on the satellite photos.
0x5a826: This time of the year the glaciers are pretty calm.
0x5a867: You should be able to ride right out of there.
0x5a8a3: I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you to come home alive.
0x5a903: Me neither.
0x5a919: I better not show my face around here.
0x5a94d: No danger of that.
0x5a96a: You two officially died after your jeep sank into the ocean...
0x5a9b6: That's not too far from the truth.
0x5a9e3: Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.
0x5aa29: Dr. Hal Emmerich should be somewhere on the base.
0x5aa68: I want someone to bring him in.
0x5aaaa: Leave it to me.
0x5aac4: Okay, Roy.
0x5aad9: Are you going to be okay?
0x5aafd: Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy.
0x5ab35: ...a hard copy of all Mei Ling's data.
0x5ab66: As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling will be fine.
0x5abb0: The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon.
0x5abf2: They won't be able to follow us.
0x5ac1d: I guess we won't meet again.
0x5ac44: Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.
0x5ac7d: Really? I'll look forward to that.
0x5acaa: Roy, just tell me one thing.
0x5ace1: About FoxDie.
0x5acf9: Meryl will be fine.
0x5ad17: She wasn't included in its programming.
0x5ad4c: What about me?
0x5ad65: It killed Liquid...
0x5ad83: Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.
0x5add2: How is she?
0x5adff: Mei Ling's with her right now.
0x5ae28: I'm switching over to Naomi.
0x5b1e4: Colonel, about Meryl...
0x5b210: I already know...
0x5b241: Colonel?
0x5b254: Meryl was...
0x5b26b: ...my daughter.
0x5b29f: I didn't find out until recently.
0x5b2cb: I got a letter from her mother... my dead brother's wife...
0x5b314: I was going to tell her after this operation was over.
0x5b358: Colonel, I...
0x5b38c: Thanks, anyway.
0x5b3da: I kept a lot of things from you.
0x5b423: Snake, I'm not a Colonel.
0x5b8a4: Really? I'll look forward to that.
0x5ba77: I heard about my brother...
0x5bab4: but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.
0x5bb0c: He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your own life.
0x5bb79: Frankie said that?
0x5bb96: Yeah. He also said he'll always love you...
0x5bbcf: Naomi, your brother just saved you, me and the whole world.
0x5bc18: He fought with every ounce of strength in his body.
0x5bc59: Maybe...
0x5bc6c: ...maybe now he's finally found some peace.
0x5bca5: He wasn't really my brother anymore...
0x5bcd6: Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar he's been like a ghost.
0x5bd25: A ghost looking for a place to die...
0x5bdd7: Naomi, Liquid died from FoxDie too.
0x5be1e: When am I gonna go?
0x5be46: That's up to you.
0x5be7e: Everybody dies when their time's up...
0x5beaf: Yeah, so when's mine up?
0x5bed2: It's up to you how you use the time left to you.
0x5bf10: Live, Snake.
0x5bf27: That's all I can say to you.
0x5bf99: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x5bff6: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x5c08e: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a core deterrent force of less than 500 missiles each,
0x5c126: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x5c1c9: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.
0x5c2bb: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0x5c326: Master? What are you doing here?
0x5c384: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0x5c3e3: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x5c485: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x5c509: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0x5c59d: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x5c62d: Well I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.
0x5c672: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0x5c6f0: My frequency is 141.80.
0x5c75e: Snake, that's the door to the walkway.
0x5c78f: It won't open even if I use the card.
0x5c7bf: Huh? Oh that's right. I totally forgot...
0x5c7f3: Do you know something?
0x5c814: That door sometimes gets frozen shut cause it's so cold outside.
0x5c862: Next time tell me beforehand. So what should I do?
0x5c8a2: It's impossible to open from the inside. They always used C4 or something from the outside...
0x5c910: From the outside? You can't open it from the inside?
0x5c952: Sorry, it's impossible. But don't worry, you'll get through. There are two walkways that connect Tower A and Tower B. The other one's on the roof.
0x5c9f8: You should just use the walkway on the roof.
0x5ca44: It's no good, Snake. It looks like that door is frozen shut. The only way to open it is to blow it open from the outside.
0x5cad1: And since the walkway on the roof is destroyed, to get to Tower B, you'll have to take the walkway on the other side of that door.
0x5cb67: If you had a rope, maybe you could lower yourself from the roof of Tower A to the other side...
0x5cc94: If you take that cargo elevator down, you'll wind up in Metal Gear's underground maintenance base.
0x5cd32: It's automatically set to go back and forth between the blast furnace and the underground maintenance base.
0x5cdae: It's not there yet, so you'll just have to wait.
0x5cea9: That elevator is for transporting vehicles and building materials to the underground maintenance base.
0x5cf3f: So that's why it's so big.
0x5cf64: The elevator you're on right now is the No.1 elevator.
0x5cfa8: That elevator won't take you down all the way, so you'll have to switch to the No.2 elevator at the relay point.
0x5d04d: Snake, the elevator won't move unless you push the switch. There's a control panel, right? Get closer and press the Action Button.
0x5d1b3: Snake, that's the relay point between elevator No.1 and elevator No.2.
0x5d207: Why was it set up this way?
0x5d22d: Well, for a long time it had been set up so that you could take one elevator all the way to the bottom,
0x5d2a5: but I heard that they changed it because of something to do with the structural integrity of the rock.
0x5d33a: The No.2 elevator is next to you, right? Transfer to that one.
0x5d5c3: If you take that elevator down, you'll wind up in the warehouse. Metal Gear's underground maintenance base is just past there.
0x5d7b4: Ravens...
0x5d7d8: There are a lot of ravens here.
0x5d814: Crows...
0x5d837: There are a lot of crows here.
0x5d893: There were ravens around from before.
0x5d8c6: But for some reason they started to really increase in number around the same time that FOX-HOUND came to the base.
0x5d94d: It's really weird. I wonder what it could mean...?
0x5d99f: There were crows around from before.
0x5d9ce: But for some reason they started to really increase in number about the same time that FOX-HOUND came to the base.
0x5da54: It's rally wierd. I wonder what it could mean...?
0x5db52: What the hell are all these ravens doing around here?
0x5db95: Ravens? ...you got me.
0x5dbc8: What the hell are all these crows doing around here?
0x5dc0a: Crows? ...you got me.
0x5de8b: I hacked into security.
0x5dead: Snake! I'm opening the door!
0x5dfa5: Is there any cold medicine on this base?
0x5dffa: What's wrong, Snake? You caught a cold?
0x5e03d: I think there's some in the commander's room. There's a pharmaceutical storage room in the southwest of the 1st floor basement
0x5e0cf: ...of the Warhead Storage Building. There are other types of drugs there too.
0x5e14c: I gave directions to another soldier who had caught a cold.
0x5e195: Well it looks like he gave the cold to me.
0x5e23e: Snake, haven't you found Meryl yet?
0x5e291: You still haven't found Meryl?
0x5e2f8: She's dressed like one of the terrorists. But that's just on the outside, the inside hasn't changed. Watch for the way she walks...
0x5e3b5: Snake, she's dressed up like one of the terrorists. She won't be able to reveal herself if other soldiers are around.
0x5e43e: You'll have to find somewhere you can be alone with her.
0x5e4a2: Even dressed like that, she's all woman. You see? Isn't there somewhere only a woman can go?
0x5e567: Snake, the Warhead Storage Building that you're in has one floor above ground and two floors below ground. Why don't you search there too?
0x5e617: She said she was nearby, so she may be somewhere in the Warhead Storage Building.
0x5e6b8: Thank God Meryl's okay. She's a tough one all right. Although when you look at her, it's hard to imagine how tough.
0x5e73f: It must be the walk.
0x5e75e: Ha ha ha. Anyway, I'm glad she's okay.
0x5e78f: I also got a key from her. I think I can use it to stop them from launching a nuke.
0x5e81c: Get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base. That's where the detonation code input system is.
0x5e8cb: Someone else must be controlling Meryl. Do something, Snake...save her.
0x5e923: What am I supposed to do? I don't even know where he is.
0x5e969: He's probably somewhere close by. He's just invisible.
0x5e9bc: Stealth camouflage. A technology I developed...
0x5ea10: Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around the user in such a way that they're rendered nearly invisible.
0x5ea97: But if you had Thermal Goggles, you'd be able to see him.
0x5eaeb: Anyway, you can't see him with your naked eyes, but there must be some way to make him show up.
0x5eb7d: Snake, someone is just controlling Meryl's mind. You should be able to save her.
0x5ed85: Please, Snake. You've got to save her.
0x5edfd: A psychic soldier...what a waste. I guess fighting was all he ever knew...
0x5ee55: Are you feeling sorry for him?
0x5ee7e: Mantis had incredible power...fantastic power. Maybe that power could have been used to make people happy.
0x5eef9: ...It's a sad thing when you see all that power being used just for war.
0x5ef86: Snake, Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north. Hurry!
0x5eff7: You should use your Night-Vision Goggles in dark places.
0x5f05c: If you want Night-Vision Goggles, there's a pair in the lab at the Warhead Storage Building.
0x5f11d: Otacon, have you ever seen a sniper rifle anywhere on this base?
0x5f16b: A sniper rifle?
0x5f185: Meryl's been shot...by an extremely good sniper.
0x5f1c3: Sniper...
0x5f1d7: A high quality sniper rifle is the only way I can fight back.
0x5f222: I...I saw a PSG-1 in the armory in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar.
0x5f280: The 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar? I have to go all the way back there?
0x5f2e0: Well...yeah...
0x5f2f9: What's wrong with you, Otacon?
0x5f322: Oh...nothing.
0x5f366: Otacon, where is there a sniper rifle?
0x5f397: There's a PSG-1 in the armory in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar....
0x5f432: What is it?
0x5f448: Wolf...I...just....forget it.
0x5f554: Snake, it's dark inside the Communication Towers. You should use your Night- Vision or Thermal Goggles.
0x5f5ee: If you want Thermal Goggles, there's a pair on the same floor as my lab.
0x5f665: There's a pair of Night-Vision Goggles near my lab.
0x5f6c7: Be careful. There are always a lot of soldiers guarding the Communication Tower.
0x5f748: The walkway is directly between the Communications Towers. Head for there.
0x5fc77: Snake, there's a walkway up on the roof, too. You should use that one.
0x5fd3c: So you figured out what I had in mind, huh?
0x5fd92: I can't believe it actually worked.
0x5fe08: It looks like you escaped. I'm glad.
0x5fe5e: No thanks to you.
0x5fe9e: Too bad. I thought you'd be able to figure out what my plan was.
0x5ff13: What are you talking about? I was just lucky that security was careless.
0x6000b: If you're looking for your items, they're near where you were being tortured. Why don't you go get them?
0x600a9: If you knew that, why didn't you just bring them to me?
0x600ee: The guard was scary.
0x60146: If you go straight down the underground passageway north of the Cave, you'll arrive at the Communication Towers.
0x601ca: You should be able to go over the glacier by using the Communication Towers' walkway. Head for the towers.
0x6029b: Otacon, I'm up on the roof.
0x602c1: That was a pretty fast climb.
0x602e9: I wanted to go slowly. But someone there forced me to move faster.
0x60339: Hmm. Well you can relax cause there's an elevator in Tower B.
0x603a2: That walkway will take you to Tower B.
0x603e5: Snake, the walkway is on the roof of Tower A.
0x6045d: Snake, are you going to take on a Hind with your bare hands?
0x604a7: I'm not that big a fool. Isn't there a weapon I can use against him somewhere?
0x60524: There are Stinger missiles in Communications Tower B. I'm pretty sure they're near the entrance to the walkway.
0x605a7: If you had a rope, you could probably get them by dropping down from the roof.
0x60635: I saw a rope on the bottom floor of Tower A.
0x606ac: Wow, Snake. You're like an action movie star!
0x606e7: Totally different.
0x60713: This is real. Not some prearranged stunt. If I screw up, there are no retakes.
0x60772: Yeah...I guess you're right.
0x607bb: Snake, there are some places on the wall where steam from the heating system is spurting out. So be careful, it'll give you a nasty burn.
0x60895: The Stinger missiles are in a small room near the entrance to the walkway.
0x60940: Snake, I'm heading your way.
0x6098d: There's something I've got to ask you...
0x609c0: Well what is it?
0x609db: Hmm...well ya see...I...I'll ask you when I see you...bye.
0x60a23: Wait a minute!
0x60b91: Snake, I'm coming out there. Just hold on, okay?
0x60c0e: You're gonna go after that Hind now?
0x60c4d: I can still hear the sound of its rotors. It's just circling the tower. He must be waiting for you.
0x60cc1: Yeah, well you won't hear it for much longer.
0x60cfc: ...Good. In the meantime, I'll fix the elevator so you can use it later.
0x60d74: I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that Hind. It might take some time, so don't hurry.
0x60e24: Snake, are you okay!?
0x60e44: So far. How are you doing?
0x60e69: Sorry. The elevator's not working yet. It's strange. There's no problem with the motor and the power is on. I need a little more time...
0x60fd7: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.
0x61095: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x612a1: Otacon, I can't see them! What should I do?
0x612da: Hmmm...Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around an object. That's how it makes them invisible.
0x61355: But it doesn't have the ability to mask heat.
0x613bb: Use your Thermal Goggles, Snake. You'll be able to see their heat signatures!
0x6144a: Huh? You don't have any Thermal Goggles? Well with your eyesight, you might be able to spot em if you look really hard.
0x617a1: Otacon, which direction is the underground base?
0x617df: It's in the snowfield to the north of Tower B. The door is security level 6.
0x61863: The weather is terrible. Make sure you don't get lost out there.
0x618b1: Snake, I don't have to tell you, but it's bitter cold out there. It'd be dangerous to stay out in the Snowfield too long.
0x6198b: Otacon, where can I find ammo for the PSG-1?
0x619c5: I...I can't tell you.
0x61ac3: The elevator is stopped at a lower floor and it won't come up. Is there some way to get to an elevator that will take me down further?
0x61b5d: Well...there is one, but...
0x61b94: Can you see to the west of the blast furnace?
0x61bcf: You see that crane? I think if you go down those steps, you'll get to the other side.
0x61c35: Did you ever see anyone actually go down there?
0x61c72: No, but I've seen mice go there.
0x61c9d: Do I look like a mouse to you?
0x61cc6: Be careful of that crane, too.
0x61d11: If you stick close to those steps, I think you can make it to the other side...probably.
0x61d8e: There's a cargo elevator in the northeast part of the bottom floor. You can take that to Metal Gear's underground base.
0x61e19: You'll spot it right away. It's got a big patrol light attached to it.
0x620a0: ...I'll be watching, Snake...
0x620f4: Snake, there's nowhere to hide in that elevator. You'll have to fight!
0x627f5: That room is still under construction because their main priority was to finish Metal Gear's underground base.
0x62874: But the good thing is, with all those containers, it should be easy to hide, right?
0x62e2d: I don't know anything about Dr. Naomi, so there's not much I can say...
0x62ea0: But, Snake, I think you'd better leave that to Colonel Campbell. Don't you think you'd better just get to the Control Room.
0x630eb: That's where the emergency PAL code override system is.
0x63130: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the base you're in.
0x63179: Do you see that ladder next to Metal Gear?
0x631b1: You can climb up there.
0x6325a: Otacon. How's it going?
0x6327c: Not yet. Give me a little more time.
0x6440c: Got it yet?
0x64422: Please, Snake, give me a little more time.
0x64486: How about it? Did you find the override system file?
0x644c8: Not yet. I need a little more time.
0x64515: Well, I found lots of information about that new nuclear weapon...
0x64565: There are 4 stages involved in launching a ballistic missile. The first one is the Boost Stage.
0x645d6: It starts at the point the missile is launched and ends after all the rocket fuel is burned and the missile is propelled into the exosphere.
0x64676: The next stage is the Post-Boost Stage. It starts after all the fuel is burned and ends after the re-entry vehicle is ejected.
0x64708: Next is the Intermediate Course Stage. It takes place after the re-entry vehicle is ejected and lasts until the missile enters the exosphere.
0x647a9: Then comes the Final Stage. It starts when the re-entry vehicle enters the exosphere and it lasts until it reaches its ultimate target on the ground.
0x64852: Missile defense systems use military satellites to detect rocket emissions during the initial Boost Stage of a missile.
0x648dd: But this new nuclear weapon employs the rail gun's ability to fire projectiles at ultra-high velocities, instead of using a rocket.
0x64974: That's why it can't be detected by today's missile defense systems!
0x649c5: And on top of that, the re-entry vehicle also uses Stealth technology...
0x64a1b: It's so accurate that its fifty percent zone comes close to 50 meters. That's as good as the best ICBM.
0x64a94: A highly accurate, undetectable, uninterceptable nuclear weapon. We wouldn't even be able to tell where it came from...
0x64b1f: And that's not all. A standard ballistic missile uses a 2-stage or a 3-stage solid fuel rocket for its propulsion system.
0x64bac: Besides costing lots of money, safely maintaining the solid rocket fuel and readying the missile for launch requires a lot of work.
0x64c43: But a railgun-launched nuclear warhead avoids all of those problems. And it's cheap too.
0x64cac: It's the perfect nuke. A general's dream...
0x64ce5: And the world's nightmare.
0x64d44: Did you find the file for the override system?
0x64d80: Just wait a little longer.
0x64dc4: I found out a lot about the arms industry though...
0x64e05: After the Cold War ended, the United States slashed its defense budget by more than 15%. Naturally, the arms industry was severely affected.
0x64ea5: It resulted in an orgy of mergers and acquisitions.
0x64ee6: Some of the big arms conglomerates today are made up of what 10 years ago would have been 20 or more smaller arms companies.
0x64f76: ArmsTech is one of those. But we lost our bid to produce the US Air Force's next line of fighter jets.
0x64fed: Then we took a stab at civilian applications, but that was a failure too. The company was about to go belly up.
0x65070: Ironically, the Defense Department was in pretty much the same situation.
0x650c7: Thanks to big budget cuts, they were forced to turn to the private sector to help fund their weapons development.
0x65149: On top of that, the government began to actively export their advanced weapons technology to the private sector...
0x651cf: ...in order to maintain a high standard of quality in the country's defense armaments.
0x65236: Eventually they decided on a joint development project for new weapon systems between the DOD and the private sector.
0x652bf: And...since both sides were in such bad financial shape, that's where all the backscratching came in.
0x65335: So there was another reason for the joint development of Metal Gear, huh. It wasn't just President Baker trying to keep ArmsTech afloat...
0x65437: The terrorists are finished inputting the detonation codes!
0x65480: The only way to stop the launch now is to re-input the detonation codes to lock the detonation mechanism. You need that key to do it.
0x65537: Find that key, Snake! There's no other way!
0x65596: You found the card key, right? First comes the room temperature key. Put it into the far left terminal in the Control Room.
0x6563a: Snake, the card key changed shape. You've got to change it back to room temperature!
0x656c0: That key is actually an IC card. Its connector pins and main body are made of a shape memory alloy.
0x65736: It's designed so that unless it has been changed to the correct shape,
0x6578a: it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the Control Room and the detonation code won't be entered.
0x65860: Snake, look at the card key. It changed back! You have to change it again!
0x658db: Snake, it looks like you changed the card key's shape correctly.
0x6592a: Go and put it into the middle terminal in the Control Room. Before it warms up and changes back to its original shape.
0x659d9: Next you've got to cool the card key.
0x65a09: Where should I do that?
0x65a2b: This is Alaska. Go outside, it's cold everywhere.
0x65ad7: But you're close to the warehouse where you fought Raven, right?
0x65b25: That place is right in the middle of the permafrost layer and there's no heater either.
0x65c12: Next you've got to cool the key. You're close to the warehouse where you fought Raven, right?
0x65fc9: It looks like you changed the shape correctly. The last card key goes in the far right terminal in the Control Room.
0x66051: But be careful. If you're in a cold place for too long, it'll change back to its original shape. You need to hurry.
0x660ea: Somewhere warm? What about the blast furnace?
0x66126: But the problem is if you go through a cold place on the way back, the card key might change shape. You need to hurry on the way back.
0x6638f: Naomi's an enemy spy!? ...I can't believe it!
0x663fe: Snake, leave it to Colonel Campbell. You've got to concentrate on re-inputting that detonation code.
0x66473: You're right...
0x66a7e: I can't really blame Dr. Naomi... I feel sorry for her.
0x66ac3: ...Ever since I was a little kid, I always hated my first name.
0x66b11: Hal, isn't it?
0x66b2a: Yeah... But I'm not a computer, I'm a human...
0x66b66: ...My grandfather taking part in the Manhattan Project...my father being born on the day of the Hiroshima bomb...I hated every part of that.
0x66c06: My name, my father, my grandfather. ...It felt like all those things were a ball and chain around my legs, dragging me down..
0x66c97: But now that I think about it, I realize that I was blessed.
0x66ce2: At least I know who I am...where I came from...
0x66d1f: But Dr. Naomi didn't even know who her parents were, what her real name was. She must have been a very lonely little girl...
0x66daf: Otacon...
0x66dc3: ...Sorry, Snake. I guess right now you should focus on re-inputting those PAL codes.
0x66ed1: You still haven't input the final card key. Hurry to the Control Room.
0x66f37: That's not the right shape. Hurry and warm it up. The blast furnace is probably the best place.
0x66fe4: Snake, that's bullet-proof glass. You can't break it with an ordinary weapon.
0x6703f: Can't you open the security lock here?
0x67070: I'll try. Just hold on for a minute.
0x67129: C'mon hurry up already!
0x6714b: Hang on!
0x67186: I'm outta time!
0x671a0: Just hold on a little longer!
0x671f0: Otacon!
0x67202: Almost there. Hold on!
0x6724f: What are you doing? The door is open, Snake. Hurry up and go after Liquid!
0x672fa: Snake, Rex's armor is impregnable. You can't do any damage with the weapons you've got.
0x67362: Rex uses the latest advances in compound armor.
0x6739f: The only way you can pierce it is with a high performance HEAT (high explosive, anti-tank) round.
0x67411: So what do I do?
0x6742c: Rex's pilot seat operates exactly like a VR system.
0x6746d: It's got multiple sensors connected to a high tech interface used for the controls.
0x674d1: It's completely self-enclosed and shut off from the outside environment.
0x67528: He's not using his naked eyes?
0x67551: That's right. So if you could somehow destroy the sensors...
0x6759b: Do you see that round plate on Rex's left arm?
0x675d8: Yeah, that thing that looks like a shield?
0x67610: That's a radome. If you can destroy that thing, it won't be able to use its electronic equipment.
0x67682: So he'll be blinded?
0x676a1: Yeah. Try to hit that radome with a Stinger missile.
0x676e3: So that will stop it?
0x67703: No, Rex was designed so it can be controlled manually too.
0x6774b: Oh great.
0x6775f: The part that looks like a beak is where the pilot seat is. In an emergency it will open up.
0x677cc: Rex's armor is perfect. You can't destroy it.
0x67808: You told me that already.
0x6782c: But the interior is a different story.
0x6785d: I get it...first I destroy the radome. That will force him to open up the pilot's seat.
0x678c5: Right. If you can shoot a Stinger missile into the cockpit, you'll destroy the computer control system.
0x6793d: You intentionally designed it with a weak point?
0x6797b: It's not a weak point. I like to think of it as a character flaw. People just aren't complete without some type of character flaw, don't you think?
0x67a22: I guess so. I owe you one, Otacon.
0x67a61: I saw it in President Baker's top secret files. Rex has a free electron laser mounted on its belly.
0x67ad5: It's a laser weapon that discharges a laser beam into an electron beam that's been accelerated using giant magnets.
0x67b5c: It can generate an incredible amount of energy...pretty close to 100 megawatts. That's ten times greater than any other laser out there.
0x67c42: First use a Stinger missile to destroy the radome and disable its electronics.
0x68032: If Rex steps on you, it'll be all over. Be very careful when he gets close.
0x680a9: Rex is equipped with anti-tank missiles on both of his knees. They're a laser semi-active homing type that doesn't use wires.
0x6813a: The shooter uses a laser illuminator to bounce a laser beam off the target.
0x68193: After that, the missile uses the light reflected off the target to home in on it.
0x681f5: Fortunately, the missiles are tipped with HEAT rounds and not anti- personnel warheads. But if they hit you directly, you'll be sorry. Be careful.
0x682b9: The rail gun uses magnetism to fire projectiles.
0x682f7: By perfecting the process of shell acceleration, the railgun is able to fire a projectile with a muzzle velocity of over 100 kilometers per second.
0x6839e: It was originally going to be used, as part of SDI, to shoot down enemy ICBMs outside the atmosphere.
0x68415: It's ironic that now it's going to be used to deliver a nuclear warhead...
0x6848b: Rex is the first actual prototype model, but they've been doing virtual prototyping for a while now.
0x68501: They pop it into a VR simulation while it's still in the design phase.
0x68555: That way they can make improvements to the design while testing it under all sorts of simulated conditions.
0x685d4: So even though it's a prototype, it's extremely well-designed. Be careful!
0x69688: Snake, I don't know anything about fighting. But, you've got to beat Liquid!
0x696f8: If you look like you're about to fall off the back of Rex, press any button rapidly. You'll be able to climb up more quickly.
0x698b9: Did you find Meryl?
0x698d7: Sort of. I'm positive I saw her come into this bathroom, but...
0x69927: There's only one exit, right?
0x6995f: Well then she must still be in there.
0x699ad: Is there any place she might be hiding in there?
0x69cdc: Snake, don't kill the dogs...Please?
0x69d0b: What are you talking about. If I don't kill them, they'll kill me.
0x69d5c: But those dogs are just innocent animals.
0x69d93: If they were guilty, it'd be okay?
0x69dc0: ...But you...you keep dogs, don't you?
0x69df1: So what!? This is war. My private hobbies have got nothing to do with it.
0x69e7f: Snake, those dogs...
0x69e9e: Gimme a break...
0x69f58: What are you using the Codec for? I'm right here.
0x69fb5: Otacon, are you still okay?
0x69fdb: Yeah. Thanks to the stealth camouflage, that is.
0x6a019: I have a favor to ask. I need your help.
0x6a04c: I was wondering when you'd ask. What should I do?
0x6a08b: I've been captured. I'm locked up here in this cell.
0x6a0ce: What cell?
0x6a0e3: There's a big torture machine nearby.
0x6a113: Okay. I know it. It's close. I'll be there right away.
0x6a19e: Otacon.
0x6a1be: I'm headed your way now. Can't you just relax?
0x6a219: I am relaxed. I just don't know how to kill time here.
0x6a25d: Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.
0x6a2e8: Otacon, are you there?
0x6a31f: Was that you who opened the door just now?
0x6a37d: So it wasn't you!...Which means that...
0x6a3bd: The door is open right? You've got to get out of there now!
0x6a462: What are you doing? Now's your chance to get outta there, Snake!
0x6a4da: Did you use the ketchup? It took me a long time to find that. It's exactly the right color and consistency too.
0x6a55a: Use it wisely, okay?
0x6a58b: That's all I can do for you, Snake.
0x6b4f5: Great job. You made it down!
0x6b53b: It wasn't easy.
0x6b567: No problem.
0x6b5c3: Snake, the doorway that leads from the walkway to Tower A is frozen shut. If you use some C4, you should be able to get through.
0x6b679: Maybe now would be a good time to blow that door open with some C4 so you can get through later.
0x6c189: You're getting shot at? But to get where the Stinger missiles are, you have to make it down that walkway.
0x6d06b: Are you in the boiler room? Those pipes are really old. Once in a while they blow out steam, so be careful.
0x6d106: You call this once in a while?
0x6dd28: The wolf dogs aren't attacking? Are you carrying something that might be causing them to act like that?
0x6ddc2: Those are wolf dogs in there. Just like their name, they're a cross between huskies and Alaskan wolves. They were bred to be used as sled dogs.
0x6de84: They were trying to create an animal that would combine the gentleness of a dog with the endurance and ferocity of a wolf.
0x6df12: But they didn't get the stamina and power they were hoping for.
0x6df5f: On top of that, their personalities wound up closer to wolves. Most of them won't even let you get close. That's why they never caught on.
0x6dffd: Oh that's right. You're a musher.
0x6e029: Yeah. And after they outlawed the use of hybrids in dog sled races in 2002, no one even wanted to breed them anymore.
0x6e0b2: I heard that most of them were put to sleep after that...
0x6e0f9: Yes, but some of the wolf dog pups that were thrown away went wild. I've heard that wild wolf dogs hunt in packs just like wolves.
0x6e190: Better be careful.
0x6e712: I want to ask you about Naomi.
0x6e73b: I'm looking into the details now, but it doesn't look good. Weren't you ever suspicious about her, Snake?
0x6e7ca: ...Snake, keep your guard up.
0x6e820: There are a lot of crows around here...
0x6e85e: Those aren't crows, those are Northern Ravens. The Inuit and other native Americans worshipped Northern Ravens as creator deities.
0x6e910: Some say that ravens have the power to predict death. The great poet Marlowe wrote about them in the 16th century.
0x6e997: "Thus like the sad presaging raven that tolls the sick man's passport in her hollow beak,
0x6ea01: And in the shadow of the silent night doth shake contagion from her sable wings. 
0x6ea70: That's pretty gloomy, Master.
0x6eab7: By the way...
0x6f1bd: Ravens will eat vegetables, meat, garbage...pretty much anything.
0x6f20c: It seems dirty to us, but that's what allows them to live even in a climate like this.
0x6f291: Legends say that crows have three times the life span of a man, and that ravens have three times the life span of a crow.
0x6f31e: That's just an old wives' tale, but it's true that crows live longer than many types of birds. Northern Ravens can live pretty close to 70 years.
0x6fd96: That place is right in the middle of the permafrost. Just like the name says, it never melts. I've heard over 85% of Alaska is permafrost.
0x6fe42: It's extremely cold there, Snake. If you don't hurry, your C-rations will freeze.
0x6fead: One way to prevent your C-rations from freezing is to hold them close to your body by equipping them.
0x70131: Snake, did you find the key?
0x70158: No, it's not here.
0x70175: Don't be ridiculous. You saw it fall into the drainage ditch, didn't you?
0x701cc: The drainage ditch...Isn't there something odd about it?
0x70212: No. There are a lot of big rats though...
0x70246: That's it, Snake! A rat must have eaten it!
0x7027f: Now, who's being ridiculous!
0x702a6: No, I'm right. There's no other possibility. Rats eat all sorts of things. There's nothing unusual about that.
0x70347: Snake, a rat ate that key. You'll have to get it back. Follow the rat's route!
0x708e0: Snake, that's probably some type of nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a gas mask.
0x70992: A cardboard box, huh. Just like Zanzibar.
0x709c9: It saved my skin more than a few times in Outer Heaven too.
0x70a12: Getting the maximum use out of ordinary on hand objects is the first principle of survival. It's especially important for covert operations.
0x70ab2: I haven't forgotten what you taught me.
0x70b2c: You caught a cold, Snake? In battle you need to be in top physical condition. Do you have any cold medicine?
0x70bf4: Your C-rations are frozen? Never eat frozen C-rats. It'll cause a temperature imbalance that'll drain your strength.
0x70c79: Make sure you warm those C's before you eat em.
0x70d29: You say the DARPA Chief is dead!?
0x70d55: Yeah...According to Naomi, it was a heart attack.
0x70db0: Well...it looks like all you can do now is find Kenneth Baker, the president of ArmsTech.
0x70e1a: He's in the 2nd floor basement, isn't he?
0x70e51: Yeah, on the other side of the wall that was cemented over.
0x70e9a: Okay. Good luck, Snake. You can do it...
0x70f06: Snake, you've got to think. Your mind is your most dangerous weapon. If things are getting too complicated, try to simplify your thoughts.
0x70fa6: You can also try calling Campbell for advice.
0x70fff: Soldiers that have been forged in the fires of battle are used to catching naps whenever and wherever they can.
0x71082: There's a big difference between real soldiers and those kids who have only been trained in VR simulators.
0x710fd: After playing for a long time, you should get some rest too.
0x71166: People's reaction speed is slowest around three o'clock in the morning, and so is their judgment.
0x711d8: If you're feeling drowsy, you should get some sleep.
0x71238: It's also important to be able to control your bodily functions.
0x71286: You never know when a long demo is about to begin, so make sure you're prepared to sit in front of the monitor for a long time if necessary.
0x71344: It's never a good idea to fight on too full a stomach. It'll make you logy... maybe even sleepy.
0x713b5: You should wait 30 minutes after eating before you play.
0x71419: Where I come from, a soldier who loses his head in combat is called a target. 
0x71499: Military C-rations place an emphasis on calories.
0x714d8: That's why it's best to use them along with some other type of nutritional supplement such as vitamins or minerals.
0x7157d: The weather in Alaska is very hard to predict. It can change on a dime. A lot of people say it's the worst weather in the world.
0x726a2: First the DARPA Chief and then President Baker die of a heart attack?
0x726f5: Yeah. Smells pretty rotten to me. Master, do you know anything?
0x72742: No..., but there's definitely something going on. Keep your eyes open out there.
0x727eb: Master, does the name Deepthroat mean anything to you?
0x7282f: Deepthroat? What? You mean the guy from Watergate?
0x7286f: No. But he uses the same name. Whoever he is, he's not part of our operation, but he's been giving me advice by Codec.
0x72909: On top of that, he wasn't using burst transmission. It seems he was transmitting from somewhere on this base.
0x7298a: Somewhere on the base?
0x729ba: ...I have no idea who that could be.
0x72c97: He's just playing with you. Why don't you try throwing away your weapons?
0x72d20: You managed to link up with Meryl. Good...So now you must have the card keys that will override the detonation code.
0x72da8: You should hurry, the time limit is running out.
0x72e31: Meryl's just being controlled. You're an expert at unarmed CQB (Close Quarters Battle), right? Stop her without using your gun, that's all.
0x72eee: Meryl must have somehow been brainwashed. There should be some way to help her.
0x7316a: People who have been through war and survived develop a kind of sixth sense to warn them of danger. Trust your instincts as a soldier, as a gamer.
0x7322e: In war, a split second can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Don't ever hesitate.
0x7329e: The slower you react, the greater the chance that you'll be beaten.
0x7330d: That inner voice that warns you when danger is nearby...you can't learn that in training.
0x73377: You've got to have survived a few firefights...seen a few friends blown away before you learn that trick.
0x7340f: When you're trying to hide, avoid places that look like the enemy might search.
0x7346f: Think about how your enemy is going to move and then sneak in there. It doesn't matter how smart you are, just use your head out there.
0x73529: Snake, divide and conquer. Try to take your enemies on one at a time.
0x781d6: Psycho Mantis...what a pathetic man. He was born with all the right tools, but he never knew how to use them...
0x782aa: You need to make snap decisions. In war, the difference between living and dying is counted in milliseconds.
0x78346: The basic law of CQB (Close Quarters Battle) is to take your enemy out as quickly and efficiently as possible
0x783c4: while maintaining your own escape route.
0x78418: Don't use your gun unless you need to. If you can get out of a jam using just your hands and feet, then do it. If you can't, then go for the gun.
0x784db: Soldiers who lose their heads on the battlefield usually lose their heads on the battlefield. Get my meaning? Always have your next action planned.
0x785a0: Think carefully about your hiding spots. You may find a place where you can hide perfectly, but if you can't get your mission done, it's meaningless.
0x78667: Always use the most appropriate weapon for the situation.
0x786ae: If you use a weapon that's not really doing the job, not only are you wasting ammo, but you're also putting your life in danger.
0x78760: One way of letting yourself know when to change a magazine is to make the last few rounds of the mag tracers.
0x7ea42: That was too close, Snake.
0x7ea67: Yeah. That was quite a surprise all right.
0x7ea9f: Hiding a bomb in your items...that's a despicable act. He should never... Well, forget it. You'd better hurry to the underground base.
0x7eb39: You're almost out of time.
0x7ec58: So you beat Wolf, huh. She was a fool to use the same tactics that failed her in your first meeting.
0x7eccd: But remember. Don't let down your guard until you've got a confirmed kill.
0x7ed79: Plan your strategy based on the enemies' positions. Try to think like the enemy commander would think.
0x7edf0: If you can put yourself in the map designer's mind, a lot of doors will open for you.
0x7ee74: Once you give up hope, it's all over. That's when you can't do anything right. Despair leads to death, you know.
0x7ef16: You've got to believe. If you believe with your whole heart, you will succeed.
0x7ef93: Sometimes in combat or when you're near the end of your rope, you can see things that normally aren't there or shouldn't be there.
0x7f029: Relax. It's not a bug. It's just the mysteries of the human mind.
0x7f096: Think about something terrible that happened in your life. Everyone has had something bad happen to them.
0x7f110: It'll help take your mind off the misery of the battlefield.
0x7f178: A real master of warfare alters his strategy to cope with changes in the battlefield conditions.
0x7f1e9: If you always follow the book, you'll be transparent to your enemy.
0x86a2c: Master, you and I...we're nothing more than dogs, are we?
0x86a73: That's not like you, Snake...Don't let what Sniper Wolf said bother you.
0x86ade: Listen. There's not a soldier alive that doesn't question himself. And if there is one, he's nothing more than a murderer.
0x86b6c: But someone like Wolf...a soldier who's looking for nothing more than their own death is no good to anyone either.
0x86bf2: Once she started to look for death, it was all over.
0x86c34: That's how you'll end up too, Snake...
0x86c9d: Naturally, in an enclosed room, your motion is limited. But that doesn't mean that you should stand still and become a human target.
0x86d35: You can win if you watch how your enemy moves and then cleverly counter it.
0x87183: They're already frozen.
0x871a5: You can warn them up by equipping them. After a while, they should be okay to eat.
0x87228: An Native Alaskan American, huh? Probably Athapaskan. They're originally from the same tribe as the Apaches and Navajos of New Mexico.
0x872c2: Anthropologically, they're related to the Japanese. There are even linguistic similarities between
0x87335: Athapaskan languages and ancient Japanese. You and he probably share many of the same ancestors.
0x873c5: ...Master, I don't remember telling you that I was part Japanese...
0x8744b: The Four Man carry is a race where you have to run with four grown men hanging from a long stick that you carry on your back.
0x874dc: Apparently Raven does it with six men.
0x87c61: Snake, I'm sure that woman calling herself Naomi is some type of spy.
0x87cb4: And now I'm starting to think that Campbell might be hiding something too. Don't trust him.
0x87d79: Snake, isn't the detonation code input system in the Control Room? Hurry up and get in there!
0x880d9: You lost the key? Hurry up and find it! They've already entered the detonation code!
0x8815d: The only way to stop that launch is to lock the system by re-inputting the detonation codes.
0x88206: If you use the Mine Detector, you should be able to find the key even if it fell into the drainage ditch. Whatever you do, find that key!
0x882cd: You got the card key back? Good job. Hurry and input it.
0x88325: You got the card key back? Good job. Now hurry to the Control Room.
0x883b5: The key changed shape. Hurry to the Control Room and input it.
0x88414: Now freeze that key. Get somewhere cold!
0x88475: Now you've gotta warm it. You need to find someplace hot.
0x884f8: So Naomi is a spy, just like I thought. Campbell is hiding something too...
0x88551: But that's okay. FoxDie is a virus... a biological weapon. There must be a vaccine.
0x885b5: We can worry about getting that later, Snake, but right now you've got to focus on re-inputting those detonation codes. Okay?
0x88674: The key changed shape. Hurry to the Control Room! That's the last key!
0x886e7: Master, I've never heard you so excited.
0x887e7: So Naomi used FoxDie to take her revenge on you...
0x88827: Yeah, but she said she wasn't the one who made the decision to use it. According to her, it was just one part of this operation.
0x888bb: Hmmm. If this goes all the way up to Campbell, it might not be so easy to get that vaccine...oh well, forget about it...
0x88975: Hurry up and get to the Control Room. Input that last key!
0x889cf: First you have to change the shape of the last key.
0x88a56: War brings out the cruelty of man. No matter how the soldier was brought up, they all turn into animals when they thrust into the heat of combat.
0x88b1a: Sometimes, even though you know it's a losing battle, you just have to fight or be damned. A narrow chance is still a chance.
0x88bca: Foresight is important in war. In times of extreme danger, people's latent sixth sense often awakens.
0x88c40: When that happens, throw logic to the wind and trust your instincts.
0x88cb0: The only way to conquer fear is to stare it straight in the face and laugh at it. Never let fear control you.
0x88d4c: Don't feel guilty about the soldiers that died from your bullets. They knew the risks they were taking, just like you.
0x90e89: Snake, what happened to your items? You're not going to try to finish this mission barehanded are you? Get your items.
0x90f25: Now that you've got your stuff back, you should take a good look through it. If you're slow equipping an item in battle, it could mean death.
0x9954d: Sound travels better in cold environments. If you're going to use a handgun, you should equip a suppressor.
0x995ed: When the temperature falls down to minus 30 or minus 40 degrees celsius, you start to get ice fogs. That's when the moisture in the air freezes.
0x99691: It may look pretty at first, but it'll severely limit your visibility. Be careful.
0x9970f: Kipling, an English poet who also won the Nobel prize, said that once you go beyond 65 north,
0x9977d: you're beyond the reach of divine protection and human law.
0x997c6: To survive in such surroundings, you have to be strong enough to not rely on God or anyone else.
0x99855: In cold like this, over 70% of your body warmth is lost through your head. Put on some kind of hat.
0x998e8: I hate hats. Is a bandanna okay?
0x99913: Well, I guess it's better than nothing...
0x99977: In an arctic environment, it's important to change your underwear if you're sweating a lot. Dawdle around too much and you'll not only waste your
0x99a1c: strength, but you could even catch pneumonia. Gaming after a bath should be avoided.
0x99a9f: It's easy to dehydrate in sub-zero climates, so make sure to replenish your fluids. But don't ever try to do it by eating snow.
0x99b32: You'll freeze your stomach and your body temperature will drop. Always melt the snow and then boil it before you drink it.
0x99bde: No cold foods or cold liquids for you. That stuff causes a temperature imbalance that actually drains your body of energy.
0x99c6c: A golden rule in arctic environments.
0x9a94e: Don't suddenly look into the dark. Look slowly from a light area to a darker area.
0x9a9b1: If you do that, your eyes will gradually adjust and you'll be able to see better in the dark. Try not to play in the dark either.
0x9aa64: When you're fighting in the dark, you need to use your sense of hearing and smell. Don't trust your eyes, use your ears.
0x9aaf2: Feel the flow of the air with your whole body. That's the way to tell where your enemy is.
0x9ab7b: People sometimes panic in the dark. Try to stay cool.
0x9abdc: When you're wearing Night-Vision Goggles, the light gets amplified a hundred-fold.
0x9ac3f: So if you look at an explosion or a Stun Grenade, you may burn your retinas. If that happens, it'll take a little while until your vision returns.
0x9b5c0: You're as good as ever, Snake. Not only are you an expert at infiltration, but you're a skilled marksman too.
0x9b63e: But never relax until you confirm a kill with your own two eyes.
0xaa61f: The most important tools you need to be a good sniper are the senses that you were born with. No amount of training can change those.
0xaa6b8: If your senses are dull from the beginning, you'll never be a great sniper.
0xaa732: According to the SWAT manual, the longest a shooter can stay adequately focused on his target is 15 minutes.
0xaa7af: After 15 minutes, the observer and the shooter change places. Sniping is usually a two man job.
0xaa83e: It looks like your target is stationary. If you've had enough practice, it shouldn't be a difficult shot.
0xaa8d8: The scope of a sniper rifle is extremely powerful. On the other hand, it's got a very narrow field of vision.
0xaa959: If you're searching for your enemy's position, it'd be better to use your binoculars.
0xab27a: If you leave a lot of footprints, you can confuse your enemy. But don't let your footprints reveal the direction you went in.
0xab30b: Disguise your footprints to fool the enemy.
0xab86d: Those mice are Alaskan field mice. Don't worry. They can't hurt you.
0xab8cb: Wild field mice don't have a thick layer of fat, but they can still survive the bitter winters here without hibernating.
0xab957: They dig tunnels under the snow and that's where they stay warm.
0xab9a5: Survival specialists, huh? I should learn from them.
0xab9e7: But there's a dark side too. Sometimes the males will kill and eat offspring that's not their own.
0xaba5a: To ensure the survival of their own genes, right?
0xaba99: Yeah. Pretty brilliant program, huh?
0xabae1: If there are mice, that means there must be an exit somewhere. Follow the mice.
0xac1db: Snake, that floor is designed so that your footsteps echo.
0xac242: Listen, Snake. There's a way to walk so that your footsteps won't be heard. I call it stalking. Here's how you do it.
0xac2cf: First, put your weight on the opposite foot that you're going to step with. Then take a step so that your heel makes contact with the ground first.
0xac376: Then as you slowly lower the tip of your foot to the floor, gradually shift your weight onto that foot.
0xac3ee: Use your knees to maintain the subtle balance. Try it.
0xac432: I...I can't do it...
0xac451: Another way is to wear your socks over your shoes...
0xac4b1: If you crawl on your stomach, you won't make any noise either...
0xaca42: The muzzle velocity of a bullet fired from a revolver is slower than one fired from an automatic. That's bad for you.
0xacacb: The slower a gun's muzzle velocity, the more damage it does.
0xacb15: That's cause the bullet will tend to lodge in the body instead of going right through.
0xacb7c: Those kind of wounds take a long time to heal. Sometimes they never do. I think that's part of the reason he likes that gun.
0xacc0c: He's a real sick puppy, that Ocelot...
0xacc5b: The biggest drawback to a revolver is the reload time. That's your chance!
0xad1cd: Meryl must be hiding somewhere in there. Search around.
0xad9ea: It's true...your enemy is a powerful telepath. But you've got more battle experience. You can do it, Snake!
0xadf88: Snake, now's your chance. Take it. Get out of there!
0xae022: Normally, when a soldier is taken prisoner, he should only give up the Big 4.
0xae080: That's name, rank, serial number and date of birth. But you're not any old soldier, Snake.
0xae0eb: I don't want you to tell them anything. Fortunately, you're strong enough to resist.
0xae184: Don't say anything to tease or anger the person torturing you. If you make him mad, it'll be that much worse for you. You'll need to save your strength.
0xae260: If you get a chance to eat, don't pass it up. A prisoner can't be choosy.
0xae2b7: You need to get your strength back so you can escape when the opportunity presents itself.
0xae356: Snake, you'll get a chance to escape. Make sure you take it.
0xae3b4: Master, I...
0xae3cb: Don't say it, Snake. You still have a mission to accomplish. That's all you should be concentrating on right now.
0xae478: In any case, don't you think you should contact Colonel Campbell?
0xae564: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xae60f: You better use that weapon you found!
0xae651: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xae6c5: Snake, Meryl's not herself. Don't use your weapon.
0xae71a: It's Psycho Mantis. He's controlling Meryl. That tune is his mind control music.
0xae7a5: Don't use your weapon. Try to knock her out.
0xae85a: That's Psycho Mantis...former KGB psychic. He has powerful telepathic abilities.
0xae8bb: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America looking for a job. He worked with the FBI on several cases as a psychic profiler.
0xae95b: Five years ago he was working on the case of a multiple serial murderer ...and he got too far into the killer's mind.
0xae9e4: As a result, he became just like the killer.
0xaea32: So he was sort of infected by this serial murderer's thoughts...?
0xaea95: In any case, after that he became sort of a psychic spy working for the highest bidder. He travelled all around the world.
0xaeb23: That's when he was recruited by FOX-HOUND.
0xaeb67: He can read people's minds. He knows every move that you're going to make. 
0xaebc3: What should I do? I've got no chance of beating him.
0xaec19: There must be some way.
0xaec4f: He's a master at controlling people. Snake! Don't let him manipulate you!
0xaecc4: Not everything you see with your two eyes is real. Destroying his spirit is more important than destroying his body.
0xaed60: Don't let him read you. Be a blank slate! Okay? Clear your mind.
0xaedcc: He read your mind with his psychic abilities. Somehow you've got to get around him!
0xaee6d: I've got it. Use the Controller port!!
0xaee9e: Plug your Controller into Controller port 2. If you do that he won't be able to read your mind!
0xaef6a: Snake, is there some reason you can't use Controller port 2?
0xaefb4: Oh well, it's okay. Do you see something that looks like a statue on both sides of the room?
0xaf021: Yeah. You mean those things with their faces all wrapped up in leather bands?
0xaf07f: Yes. Attack those statues to uncover their faces.
0xaf0be: Why?
0xaf0e1: Those statues were modeled after Mantis' real face.
0xaf122: Mantis despises the sight of his own face. If he suddenly sees his own disfigured face staring at him, it might break his concentration.
0xaf1fa: Snake, if you destroy the faces of those statues, you should be able to disturb Mantis' psychic powers.
0xaf286: He's using his psychic ability to read your Controller's moves. That's how he's evading your attack.
0xaf2fb: You've got to do something so he can't read your Controller's moves. Think! There must be some way!
0xaf39d: Snake, isn't Meryl waiting for you?
0xaf3df: It's rude to keep a lady waiting.
0xaf447: Snake, Meryl's in danger! Find a sniper rifle so you can shoot back at Wolf! It's the only way to save Meryl!
0xaf504: Snake!! What the hell!! Are you trying to kill Meryl!!?
0xaf569: Have you gone insane!?
0xaf5b2: Stop it! You'll kill her!
0xaf5fe: Snake, stop!!
0xaf63e: You're terrible, Snake!!
0xaf752: No!! I can't believe it!! Snake has gone insane!
0xaf7a4: Snake, you're a poor excuse for a man!...
0xaf807: You got a PSG-1? You can use that against Sniper Wolf. Hurry up and save Meryl!
0xaf8a6: Snake, be careful. They've set up new gun cameras and increased their patrols. They don't want you to get away.
0xaf947: You can either destroy them with a Grenade or jam them with your Chaff...
0xaf99e: You won't be able to get on the elevator unless you disable those gun cameras.
0xafa30: First you've got to retrieve your items.
0xafa91: Snake, get that bomb out of your items!
0xafac6: Select the bomb in the Equipment Window and press the O button to throw it away!
0xafb27: Hurry! Throw it away!
0xafb73: If the Remote Controlled Missile goes too far away, you'll lose control over it. Be careful.
0xafc0c: Here's how to rappel.
0xafc2c: Press the X button to jump away from the wall. While you're away from the wall, press down on the Directional Button to drop down.
0xafcc2: If you jump while pressing right or left on the Directional Button, you can make a big jump in that direction.
0xafd41: If you press and hold the O Button while using the Directional Button, you can walk slowly across the wall.
0xafdbd: If you're careful with the timing, you should be able to dodge the gunfire from the Hind while you rappel down. If anyone can do it, you can Snake!
0xafea0: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0xafefa: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0xaff59: Colonel, listen to me. I found a parachute near the wreckage of the Hind.
0xaffc9: A parachute? You don't think that Liquid survived....?
0xb000d: Impossible. As soon as he jumped out of the pilot's seat, he'd be sliced up faster than an onion on an infomercial.
0xb00a5: ...So what's that parachute doing there then?
0xb0120: Either that or a message...to me.
0xb014c: ...Meaning I'm not dead , I suppose...
0xb0180: Maybe...but I think it's more like I'll string you up! 
0xb0205: Well, in any case, don't let your guard down.
0xb0240: I won't.
0xb027f: The entrance to the underground base is further below.
0xb02c3: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there. Try to find it.
0xb035f: Snake, take that elevator all the way down to the underground base.
0xb03f0: It looks like that elevator you were riding on won't go any further down. Switch to the other elevator.
0xb047a: Metal Gear is straight down. Better move it!
0xb04d3: There's no time. The terrorists are ready to launch.
0xb0516: Negotiations are all finished?
0xb053f: The government can't cave in to terrorist's demands.
0xb0581: But they're threatening to launch a nuclear weapon!
0xb05c2: They've made their final decision.
0xb05ef: ...Why is the White House being so inflexible?
0xb0640: Colonel, is there still something you're hiding from me?
0xb0686: Snake, please...just concentrate on stopping them, okay?
0xb070c: Snake, we're not paying you to be a scarecrow y'know.
0xb078c: Poor things. Ravens are God's creatures too, Snake.
0xb081b: Colonel, where's Naomi?
0xb0851: I'm right here, Snake. What is it?
0xb087e: Oh...uh...nothing. Forget it.
0xb08a6: Strange...
0xb08f7: ...Snake, by now those terrorists have finished their launch preparations. Stop wasting time!
0xb0971: Metal Gear's base is up ahead.
0xb09cd: Snake, it's over 30 below outside...
0xb0a17: Be careful, you're just recovering from a cold...
0xb0a91: Forget it, thanks.
0xb0af6: Snake, stop lollygagging around and get to Metal Gear's base. There's no time!
0xb0bc1: Snake, that water is contaminated with nuclear waste material. If you go in there, you'll take damage.
0xb0c57: Nuclear waste?
0xb0c70: They were extremely careless with their handling of nuclear materials. Nastasha knows all about that if you want more info.
0xb0d1e: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb0d8b: Snake, get that card key back from the rat. Why don't you watch its route and set up a trap for it with the C4 or something.
0xb0e2d: Find that key! It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch!
0xb0ea7: Use your Mine Detector.
0xb0ee8: Mine Detector?
0xb0f01: Yes. The Mine Detector works just like a metal detector. The position of the card key should show up on your radar screen.
0xb0fb7: Snake, they've input both detonation codes. The only way to stop the launch now is to use the card key to re-input the codes.
0xb1054: Find that card key! It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch!
0xb10b8: You got the card key...good. Now get back to the Control Room and use that key to re-input the PAL codes. Stop that launch!
0xb130d: Snake, re-input the PAL codes.
0xb1348: Snake, the surveillance camera... When you insert the card key, don't let it see you.
0xb13cd: Try using your Chaff.
0xb1416: You could probably use a Box too.
0xb1472: Snake, what are you doing? Go after Liquid!
0xb14d7: What the hell are you doing, Snake!? You've got to stop Metal Gear!
0xb1554: Snake, we don't need a rat trap. We need someone to stop that godamn nuke from getting launched!
0xb1618: Snake, is killing rats really that fun? Torturing small animals is a sign of a warped mind, you know.
0xb1772: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xb179f: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xb1819: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xb1880: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xb18eb: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xb194e: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xb19d3: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xb1a50: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xb1af2: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xb1b7b: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xb1bf8: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xb1cb0: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xb1ce7: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xb1d0c: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xb1dab: Are you smoking?
0xb1dda: Yeah, so what?
0xb1e14: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xb1e7f: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xb1eef: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xb1f51: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xb1feb: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xb210f: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xb214d: Diazepam?
0xb2161: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xb2204: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xb2240: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xb22c0: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xb2337: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xb23bc: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xb2439: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xb2478: I am a scientist.
0xb24d6: Snake, look at your C-rations. They're frozen. You can't use frozen C-rats.
0xb2543: Until they defrost, you won't be able to replenish your energy. Be very careful.
0xb25b8: They'll defrost in a warm place. Probably just your bare skin would be fine.
0xb2656: Snake, Naomi wants to talk to you.
0xb2697: How do you feel, Snake?
0xb26b9: Well, to tell you the truth, I think I'm catching a cold...
0xb2702: I'm monitoring you via the nanomachines...Your body temperature is elevated and your lymph nodes are slightly swollen.
0xb278c: But don't worry, it appears to be just a mild rhinovirus.
0xb27d3: I guess I got it from that soldier.
0xb2801: I've increased your nutrition and elevated your blood sugar level.
0xb2851: You can't cure it?
0xb286e: Sorry, Snake. The nanomachines don't carry antibiotics.
0xb28b6: Maybe you could find some garlic. It contains natural antibiotics, you know. Vitamins and minerals too.
0xb292e: Uhhh. Raw garlic. Gimme a break.
0xb2995: There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base. That would make you feel better.
0xb29fe: If not, you'll just have to wait until your body's natural defenses take over.
0xb2ad1: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter Weapon Mode. 
0xb2b48: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xb2b92: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit Weapon Mode. The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xb2c35: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xb2c84: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xb2d18: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xb2da2: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xb2e56: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha. Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb2f40: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xb2fa6: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xb3073: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xb310d: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?
0xb3185: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xb322c: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xb32bc: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xb3300: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xb3394: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xb3433: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xb34c9: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xb3526: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xb35a4: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xb3619: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xb3686: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xb3708: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xb374f: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xb37f8: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press the Select or X Button.
0xb3889: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xb38f1: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xb3938: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xb39b1: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xb3a01: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xb3a78: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xb3b15: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xb3bbd: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xb3c41: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xb3c90: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xb3da6: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xb3e37: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xb3ea5: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xb3f04: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xb3f80: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xb4007: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xb408c: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xb43e1: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas. It represents one breath.
0xb4487: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xb45d6: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xb4639: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xb46e3: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xb4771: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xb47da: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xb4ba7: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xb4c46: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xb4cf0: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xb4d6e: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xb4df6: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xb4e43: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xb4ee1: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xb4fb8: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xb5082: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xb50e4: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xb518e: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xb5230: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xb529c: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xb535d: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xb5415: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xb54c0: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xb5568: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xb771c: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xb77b5: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xb7841: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xb7a2a: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xb7ad8: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xb7b64: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xb7bd9: Did you try hitting the wall? Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xb7c59: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xb7cee: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xb7d9b: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xb7e1d: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xb7eec: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xb7fa2: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xb801b: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xb80b7: ...I didn't know.
0xb80ef: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xb8165: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xb8211: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xb8279: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xb8315: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xb837f: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xb83da: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xb8458: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xb84a6: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xb8529: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xb8649: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xb8678: Thank God...
0xb86a3: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xb86e4: She's got plenty of heart.
0xb8736: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xb879d: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xb888a: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xb88d8: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xb8985: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xb8a1d: So you mean someone leaked the information?
0xb8a61: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xb8a9c: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xb8ae9: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on the base.
0xb8bb4: Snake, you'll have to go through the mine field to advance.
0xb8c1d: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xb8cad: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xb8cf9: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xb8d69: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xb8e59: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xb8ea5: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xb8f6f: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xb9084: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xb9491: For the time being, let's trust what that Deepthroat told us.
0xb94dc: Use a Remote Controlled Missile to destroy the switchboard in the NorthWest section of the Warhead Storage Building's 2nd floor basement.
0xb9599: Make sure your Remote Controlled Missile doesn't get shot down by those gun cameras. 
0xb965a: You did it. You destroyed the switchboard. The electrical current running through the floor should be off now.
0xb96fa: You've got to rescue Dr. Emmerich and find out Metal Gear's weak point.
0xb9763: Isn't he being held in the laboratory in the northeast part of the floor you're on?
0xb97d9: Snake, you've got to rescue Dr. Emmerich, the Metal Gear engineer.
0xb983d: He's probably being held prisoner in the 2nd floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0xb98e3: Snake, don't fire your weapon on that floor.
0xb993e: I've already programmed the nanomachines so that he won't be able to, Colonel.
0xb99a7: What! What are you talking about!?
0xb99de: Have you forgotten? That's where they keep the nuclear warheads. Can't you see them?
0xb9a4d: Yeah. There's lots of boxes piled up here, but...are they all warheads?
0xb9ab6: Yes. They're all dismantled warheads.
0xb9af0: They just leave them here? It's like President Baker said...totally careless.
0xb9b4e: They're working on a limited budget. They try to put on a pretty face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.
0xb9bd7: Nastasha knows lots more about it than I do. 
0xb9c80: All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation mechanisms removed so there's no fear of them exploding.
0xb9d09: But if the warheads are broken, they might leak plutonium and that would be a serious problem.
0xb9dc8: Snake, never use your weapon on that floor.
0xb9e61: The ninja!...
0xb9eb6: That stealth camouflage, it's him. It must be!
0xb9ef3: Snake! Emmerich's in danger! Hurry and go after him!
0xb9f58: Snake! Hurry! Emmerich's in danger!
0xb9fc3: If you have a question about members of FOX-HOUND, you should ask Naomi.
0xba02d: I'm sorry, but there's no one in FOX-HOUND like that.
0xba071: There are currently only six members of FOX-HOUND.
0xba0b1: Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf, Vulcan Raven, Decoy Octopus, Revolver Ocelot...
0xba10f: And finally Liquid Snake.
0xba133: The Genome soldiers under his command are Next Generation Special Forces.
0xba18d: FOX-HOUND is intended to be a small number of highly elite, hand-picked soldiers.
0xba1f0: You're talking about the current FOX-HOUND, right?
0xba256: Snake, who or what is that thing? Is he an enemy or not?
0xba29d: That's what I'd like to know. Naomi, you really don't have any idea?
0xba317: ...Maybe I should ask you the same thing.
0xba35e: Nothing...forget about it.
0xba3b1: Snake, he's obviously trying to provoke you.
0xba410: Snake, he's obviously trying to provoke you. Throw away your weapon and take him on.
0xba493: It looks like your weapons won't work on him. You'll have to think of something else.
0xba50c: He's fast! If you lose sight of him, switch to First Person View Mode and look for him.
0xba5e7: Well it looks like you've rescued Emmerich for the time being.
0xba633: Yeah. With that stealth camouflage, he should be able to hide safely.
0xba686: Gray Fox...I can't believe it...But the real problem is your niece. The way the Codec got cut off like that has me worried.
0xba715: Something must have happened to her...
0xba75d: You're worried? About Meryl?
0xba784: Not exactly. It's just that she's holding the detonation code override keys. They're our last chance of stopping that nuclear launch.
0xba827: You're a cold man. Your mission is more important than the life of your companions?
0xba88b: This is war. Survival is the name of the game. Sometimes you have to be cold to survive.
0xba8f4: Yes, but...
0xba91e: Snake, either way I want you to find Meryl as soon as possible.
0xbaa22: You didn't find Meryl? Why don't you take another look around?
0xbaa8d: So Meryl's disguised as an enemy soldier, huh? Well even so, you should be able to spot her if you look close enough.
0xbab16: Use either First Person View or Corner View Mode to get a really close look.
0xbaba3: You might also try to sneak in by covering yourself with that cardboard box.
0xbac14: Didn't Meryl say that she's somewhere close by? Why don't you start by searching in that building.
0xbac9b: Meryl said that she's close by. She's probably in the Warhead Storage Building? Why don't you start by looking there.
0xbad6d: Colonel, your niece is fine.
0xbad94: Thank goodness!
0xbadae: We can't relax...not yet.
0xbadd2: I know. Snake...
0xbaded: She is quite a woman.
0xbae0d: As commander of this operation, I can't ask you to watch after Meryl, but...
0xbae6b: Duty first?
0xbae81: Maybe I was wrong...sending my own flesh and blood to war.
0xbaec9: She understands about duty.
0xbaeef: I know she does...
0xbaf0c: But what I want to know is what was the real purpose of this military exercise?
0xbaf6c: I don't know. Like I said, I'm nothing more than a middleman.
0xbafb7: Is this transmission being monitored by the military?
0xbaffa: Of course.
0xbb00f: I get it. All the world's a stage and we're merely players, right?
0xbb05f: Yes, but even players can influence the play.
0xbb09a: I just hope we can prevent it from having a bad ending.
0xbb101: Snake, go with Meryl to the underground base where they're keeping Metal Gear.
0xbb1a7: Colonel, Meryl's acting kind of strange.
0xbb1da: Maybe she's just feeling a little tired from all the stress.
0xbb238: Snake, do you hear something that sounds like a song?
0xbb27b: Yeah, I do. I started hearing it a little way back. What could it be?
0xbb30a: Hurry ahead, Snake. The underground base is to the north, isn't it?
0xbb4e9: I can't see Mantis!
0xbb51b: Snake, he has mind powers, but he's not a magician. 
0xbb55e: I get it. Stealth camouflage maybe?
0xbb5a0: Meryl is being controlled by him.
0xbb63b: My First Person View Mode isn't working right.
0xbb677: You're seeing what he's seeing. It's a result of his telepathic powers. Maybe you can use that to find him!
0xbd646: Be careful. Wolves have the advantage in the dark. Not only can they see better, but they have a keen sense of smell as well.
0xbd6d7: You'd better use your Night-Vision Goggles.
0xbd72f: Ask Dr. Emmerich where the Night-Vision Goggles are.
0xbd7a2: It looks like Meryl's okay. Thanks, Snake.
0xbd98f: Colonel, I lost track of Meryl...
0xbd9bb: If I know Meryl, she's probably waiting for you up ahead somewhere.
0xbda34: To get to the underground base, you've got to go through that cave and use the passageway that leads to the Communications Tower.
0xbdaf3: Snake, there's no time left. You've got to hurry up and get to the underground base.
0xbdb6a: Snake, there's no time left. You've got to hurry up and get to the underground base.
0xbdbcf: You should be able to go north from the Commander's Room.
0xbdc6b: Sniper Wolf is Fox Hound's best sharpshooter.
0xbdca6: Everyone knows that women have more patience than men,
0xbdcea: but Sniper Wolf can go for a whole week with no sleep, no food...her sights never straying from her target.
0xbdd66: And on top of that, she takes diazepam, so that her hands never tremble.
0xbde07: Stay out of her range and shoot at her with a sniper rifle. 
0xbde70: Yeah, but where can I find a sniper rifle? I can't ask Meryl.
0xbdecf: What about Dr. Emmerich? He's been on the base for a while. He might know...
0xbdf80: Ask Dr. Emmerich where there might be a sniper rifle.
0xbdfd7: Didn't you just hear that there's a sniper rifle in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar!? Go get it and save Meryl!
0xbe10d: Stay out of her range and shoot back with a sniper rifle.
0xbe195: Good job with Wolf. Is Meryl okay?
0xbe1c2: I don't know. I don't see her around.
0xbe21a: You don't think she's been captured do you!?
0xbe254: Could be. Let's ask Wolf. If she's still alive, I'm going to get some answers...
0xbe2d9: About Meryl, I'm counting on you.
0xbe327: Snake, take the underground passage north.
0xbe3cd: Snake, the launch deadline for the new nuclear warhead is almost here. Hurry and get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base!
0xbe463: The overland route is blocked by a glacier. Climb the Communications Tower so you can go over it.
0xbe4f3: The Communications Tower consists of tower A and tower B. You're in tower A now. To get to tower B, you'll have to use the outside walkway.
0xbe5a6: Remember, Snake. Dark places are dangerous places.
0xbe5e6: You can't see where your enemies are coming from. Please use your Night-Vision Goggles or your Thermal Goggles.
0xbe69d: The walkway door won't open, huh?
0xbe6e8: Yeah. Any ideas?
0xbe703: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich.
0xbe751: Wait a minute, Snake. According to these satellite photos that Mei Ling got, it looks as if there's a walkway on the roof as well.
0xbe7fb: You can take that to the other side too.
0xbe88d: Snake, you'll have to use the walkway on the roof. Climb up there!
0xbe8fc: That's easy for you to say...
0xbe949: Use your throw move on the bad guys that are chasing you!
0xbe9af: Grenades might work well too. To get the grenade to explode near the soldiers, pull the pin and hold on to it for 4 seconds before you throw it.
0xbea9e: Snake, wait a minute. You forgot to take your items.
0xbeaf4: They're probably being kept somewhere close by.
0xbeb43: To get to the underground base where Metal Gear is, you'll have to climb the Communications Tower on the north side of the cave.
0xbec0b: Wait a minute, Snake. You're in an armory. Why don't you load up on ammo?
0xbecc4: Whew...I made it to the roof.
0xbecec: You must be exhausted, Snake.
0xbed14: It was no big deal.
0xbed32: Snake, I'm monitoring you closely. Your heart rate is elevated and your breathing is shallow.
0xbedc9: What's the matter, Snake? You out of shape from all that dog mushing?
0xbee54: The walkway should be right in front of you. Cross it to get to tower B.
0xbeeb8: Then climb down and proceed north.
0xbef04: Where are you going, Snake? Hurry and take the walkway on the roof to the B tower.
0xbf1b2: The walkway on the roof of tower A was destroyed...? That doesn't mean there's no other way.
0xbf253: Is there a rope or something around there? If you had a rope you could rappel from the roof of tower A down to the walkway below.
0xbf2e8: You're an expert at rappelling aren't you?
0xbf332: You'll have to go to the north part of tower A and use that rope to rappel down to the walkway below.
0xbf3db: It's too dangerous! That Hind is aiming at Snake! And he'll need to use both hands to rappel too!
0xbf461: You're right, but we have no choice! The Hind can't move in tight spaces. It's our best bet!
0xbf4e2: This is insane!
0xbf4fc: The colonel's right. There's no other way.
0xbf839: Snake, the Hind is still circling above the Communications Tower.
0xbf888: Damn. There's no weapon here that I can use to take him on.
0xbf8ef: Dr. Emmerich might know where there's a weapon you could use against the Hind. Why don't you ask him.
0xbf97a: Snake, hurry up and get those Stinger Missiles. Didn't Emmerich say they're near the entrance to the walkway in tower B?
0xbfa40: The way to the top is blocked, huh...Well we can worry about that later. Why don't you go and see what's happening below?
0xbfaf2: It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you. I'm looking at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.
0xbfba1: Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just circling around like a buzzard.
0xbfbf5: I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast?
0xbfc45: Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do something to help.
0xbfc99: Snake...I don't like it. Please don't go up to the roof.
0xbfce0: I have to. I can't run from this one.
0xbfd46: Liquid is waiting for you up on the roof...
0xbfe36: The staircase is broken...tough luck. It looks like the elevator is the only way up now. Okay, Snake, I want you to head up there right away.
0xc027f: Liquid means to bring this to an end now. He obviously planned this.
0xc02e5: Maybe the broken elevator was all part of the trap.
0xc0326: You mean he fiddled with the elevator to get me out on the roof?
0xc03b3: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0xc042e: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0xc051e: Use your ears, Snake. You should be able to tell where he's coming from by the sound of his rotor blades.
0xc05d0: Huh? Snake, you're not using a stereo TV!?
0xc0626: It can't be!
0xc0665: A Mono TV...
0xc0690: Hmmmmmm....
0xc06ba: Well Colonel...there's nothing we can do about it...
0xc0710: ...I guess you're right.
0xc0733: Snake, don't worry about it. There's more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. You can do it just the way you are!
0xc07e5: A mono TV...
0xc0d7c: You did it, Snake! You shot down the Hind! 
0xc0dc9: I was so worried...
0xc0dfb: Liquid couldn't have survived that.
0xc0e29: I wonder...
0xc0e3f: But even so, just cause we've taken out their leader doesn't mean they're going to give up. They're still going to try to launch that nuke.
0xc0ede: You're right. There's no time to waste.
0xc0f31: Hurry. The underground base is past the Communications Tower. The elevator is working again, isn't it?
0xc100a: They're using stealth camouflage! You can't see them, so listen closely. Use your ears.
0xc1087: How does that stealth technology work?
0xc10bb: Is it optic or chemical? ...Do you know, Snake?
0xc1134: Ask the person who invented it. He should know.
0xc1196: Snake, you can't fight what you can't see. Use your Thermal Goggles!
0xc11fa: Snake, use all five of your senses. You can do it even without Thermal Goggles!
0xc1510: It looks like the weather is getting worse. Try using your Binoculars.
0xc1564: What about the satellite data?
0xc15a1: I'm sorry, Snake. I can't see the entrance in the satellite photos either.
0xc15f9: What about a heat source? An exhaust pipe or something?
0xc163e: I can't confirm anything. Only that there are multiple heat sources to the southeast of your position.
0xc16c9: That's probably just the burning wreckage from the Hind.
0xc1723: Snake, you're in a big open space surrounded by walls. The entrance to the underground base should be somewhere in there.
0xc17b0: Stay close to the walls and you won't get lost.
0xc1829: Snake, you're our only hope. Please stop them from launching that nuke.
0xc1893: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is somewhere towards the back of the Snowfield north of Tower B.
0xc1969: It's Sniper Wolf. You can only shoot at her with your PSG-1.
0xc19dd: Snake, Wolf is hiding somewhere in that Snowfield. First you'll have to find out where she is.
0xc1a76: She should come out of hiding briefly to shoot at you.
0xc1be2: It looks like Wolf is down. Now get to Metal Gear's underground base on the double.
0xc1ca5: Colonel, there's an elevator, but it's stuck on a floor below.
0xc1cf1: That elevator can probably only be moved from below.
0xc1d33: There must be some other way down. Look around.
0xc1da3: Dr. Emmerich knows the base well. Why don't you ask him?
0xc1e10: Snake, that's a blast furnace.
0xc1e39: A blast furnace? What do they use that for?
0xc1e72: There's no airport on the base, so it's hard to bring in supplies.
0xc1ec3: They must have built a blast furnace so they could make building materials and such.
0xc1f28: That makes sense. Whew, I'm starting to sweat. It's getting kind of warm.
0xc2079: The elevator to the underground base was in the northeast of the bottom floor. Right, Snake?
0xc239c: A sad story. We shouldn't have turned our backs on the Kurds after the Gulf War...
0xc23ff: Listen. We're not responsible for her choices. Everyone decides their own fate, no matter where they were born.
0xc247f: Words like fate, karma...it's just an excuse for giving up if you ask me....
0xc24ed: I don't agree with you.
0xc250f: Maybe if she hadn't been born on a battlefield, she might have had a happier, more fulfilling life. She might not have turned into a killer...
0xc25e8: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base! The entrance should be towards the back of the Snowfield.
0xc26a5: Snake, blow away all the bad guys or you're not going to be able to get out of there and get to the underground base.
0xc3325: Vulcan Raven is half Native Alaskan American and half Inuit. He was raised as a shaman and they say he has supernatural powers.
0xc33b8: During the Cold War, he trained in Russia with the Bimpel, the Soviet special forces. 
0xc341f: In 1993, he was demoted by President Yeltsin following his coup d'etat. So he fled the country and became a mercenary.
0xc34a9: After that, he joined those rent-a-war bastards at Outer Heaven Inc. 
0xc34ff: He stayed there until he joined us in Fox Hound, thanks to a strong recommendation from Revolver Ocelot.
0xc358c: That cannon he's holding is a 20 millimeter Vulcan gun. You usually see them mounted on fighter planes.
0xc3604: You can't take him on in a fire fight. He'll make mincemeat of you.
0xc3669: He's not just strong, Snake. He's a graduate emeritus from Alaska University, so he's a quick thinker, too.
0xc36f9: In any case, you'd better not try to attack him from the front.
0xc3746: Normal weapons are no match for his 20 millimeter Vulcan. Try to attack him from the sides or behind.
0xc37ea: You're at a disadvantage in a frontal assault.
0xc3826: Try attacking him with a Remote-Controlled Missile. Maneuver it between the containers to get it to come up behind him.
0xc38b1: But if you fly the missiles too slow, they'll get shot down even if they approach him from behind.
0xc3924: Try to get them close by flying them at top speed, or by maneuvering them around corners.
0xc39a1: You could also try to predict where he's gonna move and set up some C-4. If your timing is good, it might work.
0xc3a37: When the containers get destroyed, they'll block your way. Try to take him out before that happens.
0xc3af4: Snake, if it's about Naomi, I'm looking into the matter right now. Give me a little more time.
0xc3b63: Where is she?
0xc3b7b: She's still sleeping.
0xc3b9b: I can't believe it... First, the DARPA Chief turns out to be an imposter and now Naomi...What the hell is going on here?
0xc3c27: I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know anything, right?
0xc3c76: I'm sorry, Snake.
0xc3c92: A madman is threatening the world with a nuclear weapon. I guess that's what I should worry about now...
0xc3d63: Snake, stop that launch. Head for the Control Room in the underground base.
0xc3deb: Give Dr. Emmerich a call.
0xc3e21: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the underground base, isn't it?
0xc3e84: There's no time!
0xc3ff9: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base. It's north of the warehouse where you fought Raven.
0xc44bd: Snake, the card key changed shape. That's no good. Change it back.
0xc454c: Good. The card key changed shape. Hurry up to the control room, Snake!
0xc45ce: Snake, don't warm that card key. Cool it down. Find someplace cool.
0xc464e: Snake, look at the card key. It changed to its original shape. You'll have to change it again.
0xc46ef: You've got to lower that card key's temperature. Find someplace cold!
0xc4795: Colonel, what's new with Naomi?
0xc47bf: She's being interrogated, Snake. Leave her to me. You just worry about stopping Metal Gear.
0xc4840: Please, Snake.
0xc4859: I consider you my friend. Please believe that.
0xc48c9: Snake, we're just about out of time! Get to the Control Room!
0xc494e: Snake, what are you doing? You're supposed to warm it, not cool it. Look for a warm place.
0xc49d7: You did it. That's the last one! Hurry to the Control Room!
0xc4ae6: Now you've got to warm the key up. Find someplace hot!
0xc4b79: Sorry, Snake...I'm still investigating.
0xc4c06: Snake, gas! Do something!
0xc4c36: Snake! Call Emmerich! He should be able to break through security!
0xc4c98: Snake, Emmerich will be able to open the door. Just trust him and hang on!
0xc4d8f: God help us! Metal Gear is moving...
0xc4dbe: Snake, it's all riding on you now. You've got to stop that thing!
0xc4e0d: But how?
0xc4e20: You'll have to ask Dr. Emmerich, the guy who made it.
0xc4e75: Destroy Metal Gear! We're out of time!
0xc4ec5: If you can't do it, I'll have to resort to my last option.
0xc4f0d: Last option?
0xc4f24: We have a submarine prepared to deliver a full nuclear strike on the base.
0xc4f89: What the hell!?
0xc4ffe: Colonel, Fox is dead...
0xc502a: I know.....God rest his soul.
0xc5052: Even a soldier needs more to live for than just fighting. Maybe if he had found something else, he wouldn't have been so haunted...
0xc50e9: He was too simple...too pure. There was nothing in this world for him to believe in...so he chose to believe only in himself.
0xc5184: I guess you're right. A man like Fox is really only looking for his death...
0xc51e1: Yeah. But if you ask me, there's no happiness to be gained in death... no peace either.
0xc5249: I'm gonna leave here alive.
0xc526f: Good. I want that too.
0xc52b2: If you can shoot a Stinger missile directly into the cockpit, maybe you can destroy it. C'mon, Snake! Win!
0xc55ec: Snake, great job! You stopped Metal Gear...
0xc5625: No...it's not time to celebrate yet. I can't move.
0xc568d: Snake, can you turn your neck? Take a look around.
0xc583e: Snake, you have to crawl to get through there.
0xc587a: First crouch down by pressing the Crawl Button and then use the Directional button to crawl in the direction you want.
0xc5937: Be careful though. Crawling is slow and you can't attack when you're doing it either.
0xc59b1: You can stand up by pressing the Crawl Button again.
0xc6212: Snake, there's an elevator there you can take up to the ground.
0xc6290: You'll just have to wait for the elevator to come down. You'd better hide somewhere.
0xc6307: Get on the elevator. It should take you right to the front of the Nuclear Weapon Disposal Facility. Be careful, though.
0xc63c0: Snake, don't run over puddles. The splashing sound might alert your enemies. Be careful.
0xc67dc: Snake, don't forget this is a covert operation. There are lots of bad guys and only one of you.
0xc684c: If you're spotted, you'll be surrounded before you know it.
0xc68b5: If that happens, you're finished.
0xc6901: First go to the elevator in the back and take it up to the ground floor. Then look for the DARPA Chief.
0xcb571: Snake, they're using a searchlight to sweep the area. Make sure you stay out of the beam.
0xcb609: There's no turning back now, Snake. You've got a job to do and you're our only hope. The world is counting on you.
0xcc094: It looks like a cargo truck.
0xcc0bb: They must use it for transporting goods around the base.
0xcc149: Snake, why don't you try to hide in the truck? If you disguise yourself as part of the cargo, you might be able to use the truck to get around.
0xcc22c: That base must have some kind of ventilation system to recirculate the air. There should be air ducts around there somewhere.
0xcc2dc: They must need a lot of power to run the base. There's probably a diesel generator somewhere.
0xcc34a: And since generating electricity requires oxygen, there must be exhaust openings for that too.
0xcc3e4: You're not going to believe this, but they shot down the F-16s we were using as a diversion....with a Hind D! Then we got a message from Liquid.
0xcc488: He said if we try something like that again, he'll launch the nuke!
0xcc4d9: Snake, hurry up and get in there! That Hind will be coming back soon.
0xcc56a: Snake, you'll never be able to get through the front door. Find some other way to get in.
0xcc61f: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xcc69f: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0x107783: Don't make too much noise or you'll be spotted. Be careful when you're walking on that floor.
0x10781f: Use the elevator to change floors.
0x10784c: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there.
0x1078ac: Try to find it.
0x10791f: Even though the Genome Soldiers are strengthened by gene therapy, they still need to sleep. You can move safely while they're napping.
0x1079d9: The Genome Soldiers were specially trained so they can enter into a light sleep any time and still remain in attack posture.
0x107a69: Be careful not to make noise when you're near them.
0x107aca: When they're yawning, their eyes are closed, so they shouldn't be able to see you. Be careful with your timing and you'll be okay.
0x107d01: Snake, use the elevator to move from floor to floor.
0x107d43: To call the elevator, press the button on the nearby control panel by pressing the Action Button. The elevator should show up in no time.
0x107e1c: Use the elevator to change floors. To select the floor you want to go to, use the control panel inside the elevator, on the left.
0x107ed4: Press up or down on the Directional Button to choose the floor. Then press the Action Button to confirm or the X Button to cancel.
0x107ffc: Button to cancel.
0x108027: Be careful. The elevator won't work in either Alert Mode or Evasion Mode.
0x1080aa: Hmm. It looks like the infrared sensors that were set up here have been switched off.
0x10813c: Press the Action Button to drop down.
0x108251: Snake, that door is protected by a security system. It won't open without the right security card.
0x1082d6: You can only open the door with a security card that's got the same or a higher security clearance than the door.
0x10841b: There must be some other way to get in. Take a look around. The best way to do that is to use First Person View Mode. 
0x1084a8: Press the First Person View Button to go into First Person View Mode. 
0x1085c4: Snake, the DARPA Chief's signal is coming from somewhere in that area. Isn't there some place to drop down?
0x108640: Take a look around in First Person View Mode.
0x1086b7: Snake, if you want to go up or down a ladder, just press the Action button by the ladder.
0x108ad2: It looks like the place is protected by infrared sensors. Somehow you'll have to make it past the beams.
0x108c3c: Snake. Be careful. There are trap doors near there and the fall will kill you. Stay close up against the wall and you should be okay.
0x108cf4: You should be able to see where the trap doors are if you use your Thermal Goggles.
0x108da9: If you've got a question about FOX-HOUND, ask Dr. Naomi.
0x108e03: Revolver Ocelot is a former member of Spetsnaz.
0x108e40: After the fall of the Soviet Union, he apparently served in the Russian Tax Police's elite swat team.
0x108eb6: After that, he joined the SVR, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency, which was formerly a part of the KGB.
0x108f34: But according to my sources, he was dissatisfied with the rigid system of the KGB and wanted to get out.
0x108fe5: He's a gun fanatic and totally obsessed with cowboy movies and spaghetti westerns.
0x109048: He's also something of a sadist...he learned the most advanced torture techniques while he was with Spetsnaz.
0x1090dd: Yeah, he had plenty of practice. The Lubianka Prison is located right there inside KGB headquarters.
0x10915e: In a gunfight, reloading is usually the most dangerous time. But he loves it. Use that to your advantage.
0x1091d8: You'll have to take him out when he's reloading. Can you see where his number of remaining bullets is displayed on the screen?
0x10926a: Wait for the right moment and then take him out!
0x1092dc: Make sure President Baker doesn't get hurt. If he's killed, it's all over. Try not to cross over that yellow line or you might set off the explosion.
0x1093ba: You might also try to faze him with a Stun Grenade.
0x10942f: If you get too close to Ocelot, he'll run away and shoot you from distance. So be careful.
0x1094ce: Don't forget that President Baker is there. He's wrapped up in C4, so don't use any type of explosive near him.
0x109924: Snake, there are gun cameras set up there. If they detect you, they'll open fire.
0x109986: Stay out of the cameras' field of vision. You could also try to jam them with Chaff.
0x109df3: A minefield, huh. You'll need a Mine Detector.
0x109e2f: Meryl knows the base like the back of her hand. Why don't you ask her?
0x109e95: A mine field, huh. Don't forget to use your mine detector.
0x109edd: When you find out where a mine is, crawl forward and try to recover it.
0x10a1fe: Be careful. You absolutely must not use weapons in that area.
0x10a756: Colonel, I saw your niece, but...
0x10a78c: Really? Where?
0x10a7a5: She went in the ladies' bathroom.
0x10a7d1: That's strange. I saw her go in, but now she's nowhere to be found.
0x10a840: You'll just have to look in the stalls, I guess.
0x10a87e: I guess you're right. I'll take em in order.
0x10ec5f: The guard is only human. He has to sleep and go to the bathroom like the rest of us. That'll be your chance.
0x10ecef: Snake, don't worry. You'll have a chance to escape. Hang on.
0x10ed7d: I don't know how, but the door is open.
0x10edaf: I saw the silhouette of someone in stealth cammies...
0x10edf2: Stealth camouflage? Could it be Emmerich?
0x10ee29: No, I don't think it was Otacon.
0x10ee5e: So who then?.....You don't think it could be Gray Fox?
0x10eea2: Yeah, I do. I think it was...
0x10eede: ...Are you saying that he came to save his friend?
0x10ef1e: Could be. Or maybe he just doesn't want me to die in a prison cell.
0x10ef79: ...I don't know. I can't imagine what he could be thinking...
0x10f000: Snake, you can worry about it later. Now is the time to escape.
0x10f075: Great job with the guard, Snake. Now is your chance to escape.
0x10f0c1: I plan on it. Next time I meet Ocelot, it's going to be on my terms...
0x10f152: How do you feel, Snake? Can you go on?
0x10f186: Yeah. Don't worry. That sadist can't keep me down.
0x10f1da: Snake. Now is your chance to escape.
0x10f2c6: The ketchup! You might be able to trick the guard if you use it right.
0x10f32e: Snake, why don't you use the ketchup and pretend that you're dead?
0x10f499: Snake, that's a prison cell. You can't open the door from the inside. Somehow you'll have to get the key off the guard.
0x10f524: Yeah, but how?
0x10f551: Why don't you try disappearing?
0x10f7b1: I made it to the bottom.
0x10f7f3: Thank God you're okay. I was terrified just watching you.
0x10f84c: You're incredible, Snake.
0x10f8cd: Snake, why don't you try the door that leads from the walkway to Tower A?
0x111751: Snake, you're under attack from off-screen.
0x1117e2: First find out where the enemy is. Use your binoculars.
0x111827: Then attack with a PSG-1 or Remote Controlled Missile. Something with a longer range than an ordinary weapon.
0x1126c1: What's this pile of corpses...!? It looks like they were all slashed by some kind of sword.
0x112755: It couldn't be!...
0x11278d: ...uh nothing.....
0x1127e6: Snake, I'm worried about Emmerich. Hurry up and get to him!
0x11285b: Snake, be careful. You won't be able to control your missile in an area with electronic jamming.
0x11388b: Snake, isn't that the elevator that goes down to Metal Gear's underground base?
0x11390a: Yeah, but there's no button for calling the elevator.
0x11394d: Maybe it'll come if you wait.
0x113989: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?
0x1139f1: Watch out for the steam. It's dangerous. Use your First Person View Mode to see where the steam is coming out and then avoid it.
0x113aa4: Yeah. I like a sauna now and then, but this is too much.
0x113cf0: That M1 tank is equipped with advanced vetronics. Once it locks on to a target, it automatically tracks it,
0x113d6f: and its main gun is effective up to 3000 meters.
0x113dad: To get close, you'll have to confuse its tracking system. Use your Chaff.
0x113e04: If you can jam the system and get close enough, it won't be able to use its main gun.
0x113e76: Use your Chaff at a long distance to fool its electronic systems.
0x113ef3: Even if you can get close, the M1 tank's maximum speed is 45 miles per hour. First, you'll have to slow it down.
0x113f74: Go after its caterpillars with C4 or Grenades.
0x113fb0: Once it slows down, toss a Grenade in the commander's turret.
0x113ffb: The M1 has exceptionally strong armor.
0x11402f: With your weapons, the only way to beat it is to attack the soldiers inside through the hatch.
0x1140aa: Try to aim at the upper hatch with your grenades.
0x114273: You have Stinger missiles. Now you have at least got a chance against the Hind...
0x1142f4: Only a chance?
0x11430d: Well you are not exactly evenly armed.
0x114341: That Hind is a monster. You have only a small chance to win, but at least it's better than no chance...
0x1143b9: That's a pretty grim analysis, Nastasha.
0x1143ef: To shoot down that Hind, you will have to get to a place with good visibility.
0x11444e: Do not try to fight in that walkway. Get up on that roof where you will have a clean shot at him.
0x114569: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1145f1: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x114687: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x1146d5: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x11473f: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x1147d0: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x114889: You're a tough lady.
0x1148cf: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x11491b: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x114979: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x114a01: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x114b25: Same here, Snake.
0x114b3b: 7HNASTASHA
0x114bc6: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x114c55: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x114ccb: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x114d50: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x114dc1: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x114dfe: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x114e64: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x114ea3: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x114f0f: You don't mean...
0x114f2b: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x114fd4: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x115051: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x11508d: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x115111: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x115170: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x1151bf: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x11525e: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x1152d4: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x11535e: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is a Gas Mask.
0x1153de: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x115435: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x1154aa: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x115592: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x11562f: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x11568e: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x115725: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x115795: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x1157db: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x11584a: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x1158fd: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x115986: Sometimes they are called flash bangs or sound and flash grenades. 
0x1159e2: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x115a57: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x115b23: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x115bbd: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x115bec: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x115c45: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x115d29: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x115d88: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x115e3c: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x115ec9: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x115f13: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x115f8c: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x115fc2: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x11604b: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x116099: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies, so be careful.
0x116148: That is a FAMAS.
0x116163: It is a bullpup style assault rifle. It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x116206: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a 25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x1162cd: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x1162f1: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x116331: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x1163ac: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x11643e: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x1164ac: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x116570: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x1165e0: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x11661a: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x1166ad: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x116705: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x1167b3: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x116808: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x11687e: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x116914: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x11698e: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x116a10: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x116a3d: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x116ac2: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x116b09: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x116ba6: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x116be6: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x116ccf: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x116d12: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x116d7d: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x116dc7: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x116e64: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x116ee1: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x116f6f: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x11700f: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x117069: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x117134: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x117177: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x117263: A cardboard box.
0x11727e: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x117310: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x11739d: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x11740d: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x1174a9: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x117542: wood or something.
0x11755f: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x1175c6: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x1175f3: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x117662: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x117686: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x11770e: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being heard.
0x11776b: The outside is made of reinforced plastic and the inside is made from an acetate weave. 
0x1177d9: Also the eye pieces are specially treated so they won't fog up. 
0x11782b: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x1178e0: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x1178ff: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x117954: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x1179cb: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x117a18: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x117aa4: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x117b21: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x117b7c: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x117c46: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x117cbc: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x117d3a: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x117d6c: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x117e00: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x117ea4: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x117f4c: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x117f86: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x118072: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x1180c5: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x1181d8: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x118251: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x11829a: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle them right away?
0x118305: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x11838a: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x1183ef: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x118455: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x1184d3: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x118559: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x1185a5: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x1185fa: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x118644: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x1186be: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x118747: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x1187ed: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x118856: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x11889f: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x11893d: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x1189c4: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x118a3d: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x118abd: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x11d1a4: They were conducting exercises with this new Metal Gear prototype? Is that what the DARPA Chief said?
0x11d22a: What the hell...!?
0x11d247: So you know about Metal Gear?
0x11d26f: Just rumors. I heard it is some kind of walking tank that can deliver an accurate nuclear strike from any terrain...mountains, deserts, swamps...
0x11d314: ...wherever. But you are the real expert on Metal Gear, aren't you Snake?
0x11d36e: Yeah, I guess I am. But what about the PAL system that the DARPA Chief mentioned?
0x11d3d1: It is a device attached to a nuclear weapon system to prevent the missile from being armed or launched.
0x11d449: Usually a secret detonation code or combination is necessary to launch the missile.
0x11d4ad: According to the chief, there are two codes and the terrorists already know one of them.
0x11d516: The other code...if the terrorists find out that one too...
0x11d55f: Yeah... I've got to hurry and rescue President Baker...
0x11d5c2: PAL stands for Permissive Action Link. It is a safety system attached to nuclear missile systems.
0x11d638: The missile cannot be fired without the insertion of a special electronic code.
0x11d698: But if the terrorists have found out the detonation codes, they can launch the missile anytime they want.
0x11d730: Is it possible to destroy the PAL system so that the missile can be fired even without inserting the detonation code?
0x11d7b9: I do not believe so.
0x11d7d8: It is set up so that the warhead will become automatically inactive if any attempt is made to remove, deactivate or destroy the PAL.
0x11d870: So unless the terrorists either learn the detonation codes or get their hands on the detonation code override keys,
0x11d8f7: ...there's no way they can launch...
0x11d926: Do not be too sure. Any system can contain bugs or malfunctions. We cannot relax yet.
0x11d9aa: I do not know much about Metal Gear. Just the little I have heard.
0x11d9fa: I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in 1995 and then again in Zanzibar in 1999...
0x11da5b: Both were Third World countries led by military regimes.
0x11daa1: They secretly developed Metal Gear to increase their military and political power throughout the world.
0x11db19: But both were stopped by a lone hero...you, Solid Snake.
0x11db74: That was a long time ago....
0x11dbb9: All the ICBM silos are closely monitored by military satellites.
0x11dc07: SLBM-equipped submarines can move secretly, but naturally they are limited to launching from the water.
0x11dc7f: Finally, there are ALBMs which can be launched from aircraft. They allow for excellent mobility, but they are somewhat unreliable...
0x11dd17: Metal Gear was developed to solve all those problems.
0x11dd5a: It can move freely over any terrain and independently launch a nuclear missile at any target in the world.
0x11ddd5: It completely changes the nature of the strategic arms race and destroys the delicate nuclear balance...It's a weapon to be feared, believe me.
0x11de97: The development of Metal Gear is a cynical attempt to consolidate and increase our military dominance...
0x11df10: ...while at the same time maintaining the pretense of disarming ourselves.
0x11df68: Now that the SLCM zero option, allowing for the sneak inspections of submarines in international waters, has been concluded,
0x11dff8: ...the value of submarines as strategic weapons has been greatly diminished.
0x11e052: With Metal Gear, governments of the world will be able to avoid this type of inspection,
0x11e0bb: ...and at the same time stay in compliance with international nuclear treaties.
0x123987: Look at him move! ...He must have some kind of powered exoskeleton.
0x1239fa: Powered exoskeleton? You mean like prosthetic arms and legs?
0x123a44: No. Prosthetics are intended to replace original body parts. That ninja's exoskeleton makes him far stronger than any normal human.
0x123adb: He is a true cyborg... a cybernetic organism.
0x123b16: So he's half machine, huh...?
0x123b3e: I heard rumors about the experiments, but I had no idea that such a creature really existed...
0x123bd1: Snake, to save Dr. Emmerich, you must defeat that ninja. Don't give up.
0x12727c: It is just like Baker said. We are facing increasing danger from stored nuclear materials.
0x1272e7: You see, there are three elements necessary in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
0x12734a: Nuclear materials, nuclear engineers, and manufacturing technology.
0x12739b: All three of them can easily be acquired by either legal or illegal means. If you have enough money, that is.
0x12743a: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x127487: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x1274f2: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x127554: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.
0x127608: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x127695: That stands for Material Unaccounted For. 
0x1276d0: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.
0x127761: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x1277c4: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x127862: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...
0x127902: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x127993: They are big on the nuclear deterrent theory.
0x1279d2: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x127a6b: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...
0x127af3: ...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike. Those two probably feel that Metal Gear will further promote that security...
0x127b9a: The right-wingers believe that as long as any country has nuclear weapons, they must have them as well.
0x127c12: That is why they will never be in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x127c77: And with each new country that acquires nuclear capabilities, the need for maintaining that counterstrike threat increases.
0x127d06: As long as the nuclear deterrent policy continues, we'll never be rid of nuclear weapons...
0x127d90: The theory of nuclear deterrence was born during the Cold War, at a time of great suspicion between the US and the USSR.
0x127e1c: The great gulf between the ideologies of East and West caused a dramatic escalation in the arms race.
0x127e92: And this escalation of the arms race in turn fueled mutual distrust and fear between the world's two great superpowers.
0x127f1d: The last half of the 20th century was shaped by the policy of nuclear deterrence.
0x127f7f: But the world has changed.
0x127fa4: The Cold War has ended and we are now living in a world where small, regional conflicts are breaking out all over.
0x12802a: Things are not so simple anymore, and the policy of nuclear deterrence is obsolete.
0x12808e: Most of these regional conflicts are the result of age old enmities between different ethnic groups and religions.
0x128114: In those cases, the hatred often runs so deep that rationality is thrown out the window.
0x12817d: For people such as them, the fear of a counterstrike often means little and that is why the nuclear deterrence policy has lost much of its efficacy.
0x128225: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.
0x12dc25: You found Meryl. Harasho!
0x12dc94: Meryl is acting kind of strange...
0x12dcc1: It could be the stress of battle. ...I have a friend who had Chechan Syndrome. 
0x12dd24: He became depressed six months after returning from Chechnya and took his own life.
0x12dd89: He was forced to fight people who spoke his own language...people with his own culture. He couldn't live with the guilt of it...
0x12de1d: It sounds like PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.
0x12de5f: A lot of veterans returning from Vietnam suffered from that...in fact, many still do.
0x12dec5: Yes, it is also similar to the Afghan Syndrome. In Meryl's case, it is probably a much more short-term condition...
0x12df6a: Try to cheer her up. She'll come out of it.
0x12dfcb: Meryl is definitely not herself. Could she be dragged?
0x1316dc: Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation...
0x13175a: ...without ever exploding a nuclear device. Is that true?
0x1317a1: Yes, it is true. Since the establishment of DARHT, (the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility),
0x13181d: and NIF, (the National Ignition Facility) early in the 21st century, there has been a wealth of data concerning nuclear fission and fusion.
0x1318bc: There is also much data accumulated from the nuclear tests conducted over the last four decades.
0x13192d: With the processing speed of today's supercomputers, they can design a new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer simulations.
0x1319e6: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x131a5e: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x131af7: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x131b4a: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x131bf0: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x131c99: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x131cfd: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.
0x131d5f: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x131dd1: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x131e5a: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x131edc: ...but that is nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x131f20: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x131f87: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear weapons.
0x132009: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.
0x1320a8: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?
0x132103: That was the secret World War II project responsible for the creation of the first atomic bomb.
0x132173: It had a huge budget, something like two billion dollars. They brought in 120,000 of the best and brightest scientists and engineers to work on it.
0x13221a: And we all know how that story ended.
0x13224a: In July of 1945, they exploded the first nuclear device at Trinity, followed shortly after by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x1322d3: Trinity...the world was changed forever that day. Scientists and researchers could no longer pretend that their hands were clean of blood.
0x132371: Afterwards, the leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, said:
0x1323d0: "The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose. 
0x132450: When Dr. Emmerich designed the new Metal Gear prototype, he thought he was creating a mobile TMD system. He is a very naive man.
0x1324e4: TMD stands for Theater Missile Defense. 
0x13251d: They represent a shift in defense priorities from dealing with the threat of ICBMs from the former Soviet Union,
0x1325a1: ...to dealing with small scale regional conflicts in the Third World.
0x1325f4: Current TMD systems work by a combination of THAADs, theater high altitude air defense, which intercept missiles outside of the atmosphere,
0x132693: and Patriot-type missiles which intercept missiles within the atmosphere.
0x1326ed: Dr. Emmerich was planning on them using Metal Gear as a low atmosphere mobile missile interceptor unit.
0x132783: There are many in Russia as well as America who are opposed to TMD systems...
0x1327e1: ...because they say that it undermines the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
0x132852: And there are also those who say that the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over from the Cold War.
0x1328c3: They argue that the strategy of MAD (mutually assured destruction) should be maintained by limiting missile defense systems.
0x132953: There was a big debate over it, but ultimately, under pressure from the Defense Industry who was looking to expand into new markets,
0x1329eb: TMD systems were accepted as an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x139c86: Snake, you cannot win without a sniper rifle...you cannot save the girl either.
0x139ce3: Find a sniper rifle. It is the only way to save Meryl.
0x13d37b: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x13d441: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x13d4b8: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x13d51b: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x13d5ca: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x13d624: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x13d6bf: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x13d733: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x13d7d0: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x13d870: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x13d8eb: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and dramatically.
0x143a86: That was a close one. I didn't think they would go so far as to booby trap your equipment. ...sneaky bastards.
0x143b4b: When you're in a dark place, you should use Night-Vision or Thermal Goggles.
0x143bf1: To beat that Hind, you need a SAM, a surface to air missile.
0x143c3c: You cannot shoot it down with just small arms fire. If only you had a Stinger...
0x143cb0: Only a handful of pilots in the world could operate a Hind in a blizzard like this.
0x143d15: The IR and night-vision equipment would be useless. He must be flying on manual. That means your Chaff won't work.
0x143eb8: The Hind is still around. You'll need a surface to air missile to take him on. Like a Stinger or something...
0x14421e: Your best chance is to hit him while he is circling, when his nose isn't pointed at you. That is your opening. Shove a Stinger missile up his butt!
0x1442f4: That machine gun can rip you to shreds in seconds.
0x144334: When it is facing in your direction, you'd better hide in the shadows up there.
0x1443b2: You cannot move while operating your Stinger missile.
0x1443f5: Focus your sights on that bird as soon as it shows its tail. When its gun turret is aimed at you, quickly hide in the shadows.
0x144487: Use your R1 Button effectively.
0x1444cf: That Hind is equipped with infrared and night-vision equipment. It can fly even in pitch darkness. But there's one thing...
0x148370: So the terrorist's intentionally set their deadline to coincide with the signing of the START 3 Accord...
0x1483ea: According to the terms of START 3, both Russia and the U.S. are to reduce the number...
0x148452: ...of their nuclear warheads in deployment to between 2,000 and 2,500 missiles.
0x1484b2: The current President has not yet had any major foreign policy successes.
0x148509: His term will be up soon and the word at the White House is that he desperately wants this one for the history books.
0x148592: Typical politician...
0x1485b2: It is a big concern for him and his supporters.
0x14860d: The signing of the START 3 was dependent on ratification of the START 2.
0x148666: But MIRVs were the most important weapon in Russian arsenal.
0x1486b0: Naturally, the conservatives in the Russian Parliament were greatly opposed to disarming them.
0x14871f: The expansion of NATO, along with tension caused by disagreements...
0x148771: over the application of the ABM Treaty with regards to TMD systems made ratification in the 1990's difficult.
0x1487ef: It took a tremendous amount of pressure and secret negotiations to get the Russians to sign the START 3 tomorrow.
0x148874: But the political situation in Russia is tenuous at best and one small incident could bring the signing to a crashing halt.
0x148903: If the Russians learn that America has secretly developed a new type of nuclear weapon, there is no telling how they might react.
0x148998: World opinion will be strongly against us too.
0x1489d4: That Liquid Snake is a smart one...he knows the political climate. His actions were obviously very well calculated...
0x148a78: It is true that the signing of START 3 would mean a reduction in nuclear missiles,
0x148adb: but it would still leave between 4,000 to 5,000 missiles between the US and Russia alone.
0x148b45: That is more than enough to destroy every living thing on this planet several times over.
0x148baf: There is a big difference between nuclear reduction and nuclear elimination.
0x148c2a: Negotiations for START 3 began in the late 1990's.
0x148c6a: The Russian President had actually been pushing for a much more ambitious arms reduction pact, but it was rejected by the Americans.
0x148d02: America was the sole remaining superpower on the Earth and they were not too eager to give up the title.
0x148d7b: The fact is in the history of the world, no dominant power has ever willingly given up the reigns of that power.
0x148dfc: ...in the case of the US, that means nuclear superiority.
0x148e61: There has been a lot of effort to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons,...
0x148ec6: but even today, there is no treaty limiting tactical nuclear weapons.
0x148f19: It may look from the outside that the world is disarming, but in fact nuclear weapons are not going anywhere soon.
0x148fba: The Nuclear Age is not over yet. As long as one country in the world has nuclear weapons, they will never go away.
0x14f4ff: My God, you actually shot down that Hind...
0x14f553: You're the one who said I could do it with a Stinger. ...You didn't really think I had a chance, did you?
0x14f5d0: It is not that...
0x14f5fa: Well after all, that Hind shot down two F-16s.
0x14f636: It is hard to believe that after doing that it got taken out by just one man...nice going, Snake.
0x14f6f3: Stealth camouflage? Yes. That is the new material, recently developed, which hides a person's body by bending light.
0x14f77e: I think you should ask the person who invented it.
0x14f7e3: Use the Thermal Goggles like Dr. Emmerich said.
0x14f832: If you don't have Thermal Goggles, there is not much you can do.
0x14f881: Try to watch for a faint disturbance in the air. That's where your stealth soldiers are.
0x14f917: Snake, to get to the underground base, you have to get past the snowfield where Sniper Wolf is waiting.
0x14f992: You will have to take care of her to complete your mission.
0x14fa16: It looks like, Raven's holding an M61A1 20 mm. multi-turreted machine gun. They're usually mounted on F16s.
0x14fa92: With its 6 rotating turrets, it can fire 4000 20 mm. rounds per minute. And it's accurate, too.
0x14fb02: If you come at him from the front he will turn you into borscht.
0x14fb72: Stay out of his way. You have to hide and attack. Try a Remote Controlled Missile or your C4 explosives.
0x153b93: There is no doubt about it. After the Cold War ended, the chance of a full-scale world-wide nuclear conflagration was diminished.
0x153c28: But on the other hand, the chances of local, tactical use of nuclear weapons greatly increased.
0x153c98: Civil wars, revolutions, regional disputes...it seems like there is a new war popping up somewhere every day,
0x153d19: and many of them are the result of centuries-old hatred between different ethnic or religious groups.
0x153d8f: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x153dcf: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.
0x153e54: A nuclear deterrent is meaningless because emotions run so hot.
0x153ea1: Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear missiles, the decision to use tactical nuclear missiles is in some cases left up to battlefield commanders.
0x153f46: It is pretty scary.
0x153f64: As long as nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the chances that someone is going to use them will also continue to grow...
0x154015: Ironically, the policy of nuclear deterrence has prevented the elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x154085: The entire basis for determining them to be illegal has been undermined by this military policy.
0x1540f6: In other words, nuclear weapons cannot be declared illegal because we have an entrenched policy which makes them legal ipso facto.
0x1541aa: America and Russia are not the only countries with nuclear weapons.
0x1541fb: During the Cold War, the UK, France and China publicly declared the existence of their own nuclear arsenals.
0x15427b: Since we entered the 21st century,
0x1542a8: we have confirmed the existence of nuclear weapons programs in countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia.
0x154340: Nukes are steadily proliferating. The 21st century is paying for the 20th century's failure to plug the holes in the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)
0x1543e8: and for the IAEA's failure to tighten nuclear control measures.
0x154453: The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was established in 1957 to oversee peaceful as well as military applications of atomic power.
0x1544f2: But the IAEA can only investigate those countries which request an investigation.
0x154554: Furthermore, the timing of the inspection must be approved by the country in question. They are not allowed to do sneak inspections.
0x1545ed: The country that is being investigated can even dictate the nationality of the inspectors that they will allow in.
0x154671: In the late 1970's, Iraq would only allow inspectors from Bulgaria and Russia to enter the country.
0x1546e5: The IAEA does not even have the authority to level fines against countries who have committed infractions.
0x154763: After the Gulf War, they discovered that Iraq had been developing nuclear weapons in secret right under the investigators' noses!
0x1547f8: Unfortunately, as an organization, the IAEA just did not have the teeth to effectively stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
0x1548bb: In 1970, all five nuclear powers, America, the Soviet Union, France, England and China, signed the NPT.
0x154933: The treaty provided that the non-nuclear equipped countries could receive assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear power.
0x1549c7: But military applications of nuclear power were strictly prohibited,
0x154a19: and the IAEA was given the responsibility of investigating countries who were suspected of being in non-compliance with the NPT.
0x154aad: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x154b03: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between...
0x154b93: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x15a552: I cannot believe it! Dr. Naomi working with the terrorists...
0x15a59d: I don't want to believe it either.
0x15a5ca: But if what Campbell says is true...
0x15a5f9: I know. Nastasha, have you ever heard of FoxDie?
0x15a637: FoxDie? No, sorry...I've never heard of it.
0x15a670: Oh well....Forget about it.
0x15a6b8: Snake, forget about Dr. Naomi. Right now the most important thing you have to worry about is reinserting that PAL code.
0x15a777: Nastasha, I'm going to ask you one more time. Do you know anything about FoxDie and the real nature of this operation?
0x15a801: Sorry. I have not been told anything about that.
0x15a83f: That's funny. The Colonel said almost exactly the same thing.
0x15a89f: Sorry. I didn't mean to sound sarcastic. I believe you...
0x15a944: Snake, you are in danger! Get out of there!
0x15a97d: Yeah but how?
0x15a9b3: Isn't there someone who knows this base...?
0x15a9ec: Dr. Emmerich! Maybe he can do something.
0x15aa34: All you can do is wait for Dr. Emmerich to open the door. Stay alive, Snake.
0x15ab54: I am a military analyst and an expert on high-tech weapons, but I do not know anything about Metal Gear.
0x15ac15: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x15ac75: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x15af83: Radome stands for radar dome. It is a cover protecting a super-sensitive electronic scanning array.
0x15aff7: Almost all modern combat aircraft have them.
0x15b031: It is not just a radar system in there. That radome probably contains infrared sensors, motion detectors, and other quipment, too.
0x15b0c7: It is like a combination of eyes, ears and nose all rolled into one. If you could destroy that you might have a chance...
0x15b172: Use your Stinger missiles carefully. If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.
0x15b5d6: Snake, it is just you and Liquid now. There's no advice I can give you.
0x15b62b: Trust yourself! You have got to win!!
0x15ecaf: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x15ed17: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x15eda2: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x15ee01: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x15ee55: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x15eef9: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x15ef57: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x15efcc: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x15f037: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x15f0a5: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x16b208: That stuff that is flowing in those ditches on the 1st floor must be radioactive nuclear waste water.
0x16b27e: You had better stay away from it. You are already exposed enough just by being in that area. Any further exposure could be fatal.
0x16b313: That place does not have a nuclear processing facility.
0x16b358: It must be some other kind of nuclear material that is leaking besides the dismantled nuclear warheads...
0x16b3d2: ...probably spent nuclear fuel or something.
0x16b42a: Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear reactor, it will always produce, as a waste product,
0x16b493: some spent-fuel mixed with highly toxic, radioactive compounds.
0x16b4e0: Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive for 300 years. In other words, this material will remain lethal for the next three centuries.
0x16b594: There was a time when we thought it was safe to seal the nuclear waste in special containers...
0x16b604: and bury it in a layer of rock salt without much exposure to underground water.
0x16b664: Even though we now know there are big problems with that, we still do not have an effective disposal solution.
0x16b6e3: Most of the nuclear waste we produce is just shoved underground with no intention of ever processing it.
0x16b75c: It is like an ostrich with its head in the sand. No?
0x16b7bc: There is a process which involves mixing the nuclear waste with low grade uranium to convert it into a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...
0x16b850: ...for burning in light water reactors, usually in the form of glass logs.
0x16b8a8: But MOX contaminates a nuclear reactor more quickly than low grade uranium. It is also highly toxic.
0x16b91d: It is economically unfeasible unless the price of uranium is more than four times what it currently is.
0x16b995: Not only that, you cannot ignore the danger inherent in transporting the MOX from the processing factories to the nuclear reactors.
0x16ba2c: An accident could lead to radioactive contamination or the materials could be hijacked by terrorists...
0x16baa4: No, I do not think MOX could be called a viable solution to the problem of plutonium disposal.
0x16bb31: There is only one effective use for nuclear waste.
0x16bb71: Military applications. You see, after chemical reprocessing, they can separate plutonium from the nuclear waste.
0x16bbf5: Nuclear weapons normally use military grade plutonium 239 with a purity of 93-94%.
0x16bc58: It is made in special nuclear reactors designed for military applications.
0x16bcb0: On the other hand, the plutonium in spent nuclear fuel only has a purity of about 60%.
0x16bd17: But that does not mean that spent nuclear fuel cannot be used for military applications.
0x16bd80: America has been successful in tests using weapons made from nuclear reactor grade plutonium.
0x16bdee: That means that eventually everyone will be able to make nuclear weapons from plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel.
0x16be9a: Spent nuclear fuel can also be used to make depleted uranium (DU) bullets or shells. They are armor- piercing anti-tank rounds.
0x16bf2d: DU is two-and-a-half times denser than steel and 50% denser than lead, so it makes it an extremely effective armor-piercing weapon.
0x16bfc4: It can cut through tank armor like a hot knife through butter.
0x16c010: Unfortunately, when a DU round explodes, it spreads a fine dust which, when absorbed into a body,
0x16c082: supposedly causes terrible long-term health problems including genetic damage.
0x16c0e1: During the Gulf War, American as well as Iraqi soldiers were exposed to DU dust and suffered from radiation poisoning and other illnesses.
0x16c17f: The American government conducted research to discover whether exposure could lead to cancer or genetic damage,
0x16c202: ...but the results were inconclusive.
0x16c232: Some people think that this type of radioactive contamination is what is behind the Gulf War Syndrome ,
0x16c2ad: but the government will not admit it...
0x16c2fd: They are currently doing research to find ways to transform minor actinoids such as Americium and Neptunium,
0x16c37a: which are highly toxic with long half lives, into nuclear materials with short half lives.
0x16c3e5: It's called extinction processing, but it is not being used much due to all the technical and economic problems with it.
0x16c471: A serious program for nuclear waste treatment has yet to be established.
0x17123f: Security cameras? Da.
0x17125f: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff, you will be able to disable it.
0x19d3fa: Snake, that room is set with infrared sensors. You should be able to see them if you had some smoke... cigarette smoke or something.
0x19d4b1: Sorry, but these are smokeless cigarettes.
0x19d4e9: You mean those cigarettes that are designed to cut down on second- hand smoke?
0x19d548: Oh well. Don't worry... If you blow the smoke in the direction of the infrared sensors, you should be able to see them.
0x19d5d3: That was a good idea bringing the cigarettes. But don't smoke too much. Cigarettes make you weak, in mind and body. They are bad for you.
0x19dd20: Snake, there are Gun Cameras somewhere around there. They'll open fire automatically if they detect you. Be careful.
0x19dda8: You should be able to confuse their sensors briefly with your chaff. Get past them while they are disabled!
0x19de43: You could also destroy them with your Stinger missiles.
0x19e53b: He's using a Single Action Army? The first model of that gun was made in 1873...over 130 years ago.
0x19e5af: Today they're still being made in small numbers, but that's just for collectors and such. Nobody uses them in combat anymore...
0x19e660: The biggest drawback to revolver style handguns is the reload time. That's your chance.
0x19f3d8: Snake, radiation sickness is a horrible thing...
0x19f416: I watched my friends, family...all my loved ones die slowly from it.
0x19f468: It ate away at them like a living thing...they died wretched deaths. All I could do was watch.
0x19f4d7: I sat in my bed and cried for days, whimpering in fear.
0x19f51c: I thought it was my turn next...
0x19f55c: I was cursed...cursed by the sudden explosion at Chernobyl. Why did this terrible thing have to happen to us?! I cursed at God for what he did to us...
0x19f607: I went to America after my parents died, but the terrible curse followed me.
0x19f664: It was not until many years later that I decided to put all of my efforts into making this world free from nuclear weapons...
0x19f6f5: After I learned that I was unable to have children.
0x19f736: Nastasha...I'm sorry.
0x19f756: Since I was exposed at age 10, I suffered from problems with my thyroid gland.
0x19f7b5: ...It wasn't really a surprise, but when the reality of it hits you...it is quite a shock.
0x19f820: You became infertile from radiation poisoning?
0x19f85c: To be told that you cannot have a child...that you will never be able to pass on your genes to a new generation...
0x19f8e2: ...you cannot know what it is like.
0x19f925: It took a long time, and I hurt a lot of people along the way, but learning I was infertile allowed me to think clearly.
0x19f9b1: I decided that instead of having children, I would help to make the world a safe and better place for future generations.
0x19fa3e: I determined to work for the elimination of nuclear weapons, and so I joined the Pentagon.
0x19faa9: Nastasha....
0x19fac0: I'm sorry to go on and on about myself.
0x19faf2: Please forget I said anything.
0x1a256b: Snake, that is a nuclear warhead storage area.
0x1a25a7: Are all these filled with nuclear warheads?
0x1a25e0: Yes. But their detonation mechanisms have been removed.
0x1a2625: So I don't have to worry about this island turning into a pile of smoking rubble?
0x1a2687: No. But if the casing is damaged, they may be leaking nuclear materials. Please make sure you do not use your gun around there.
0x1a2739: Naturally, nuclear weapons contain plutonium.
0x1a2774: Most of the radiation emitted by plutonium isotopes consists of alpha rays.
0x1a27d0: The ionization effects are strong, but if they are kept in containers there is no danger of exposure.
0x1a2846: But if plutonium enters the body through breathing or other contact, it is quickly absorbed into the bones and internal organs.
0x1a28da: After that, there is no way to remove it. 
0x1a2912: Once that happens, the victim will be constantly exposed to it, and just one one-millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer.
0x1a29a9: That is why a plutonium leak is such a serious danger. Make sure you do not use your gun anywhere near there.
0x1a2a45: Scientists are currently using gene therapy to try to create a microorganism capable of breaking down plutonium, but...
0x1a2ad0: ...they have not yet had any success.
0x1a2b03: The plutonium version of bio-remediation, huh.
0x1a2b3f: Instead of processing, what about reusing it? I thought that they were working on using dismantled plutonium for civilian applications.
0x1a2bda: For a time, it looked like there was going to be international cooperation for that,
0x1a2c3f: ...but unfortunately there was too much mutual suspicion, and it all fell apart.
0x1a2cbb: The signing of START was a step in the right direction, but it created a flood of dismantled plutonium.
0x1a2d33: Disposing of that plutonium safely is now the biggest challenge facing the world.
0x1a2d95: Combustion in nuclear reactors, vitrification processing...lots of suggestions have been made, but in reality...
0x1a2e19: ...no effective solutions have been found.
0x1a3c5f: That area is mined?
0x1a3c9e: If you only had a Mine Detector...
0x1a3cd9: After you locate the mines on your radar, crawl forward and retrieve them.
0x1a3d50: Anti-personnel mines have killed over 20,000 non-combatants in the past thirty years.
0x1a3db6: In countries like Cambodia and Nicaragua, the killing and maiming of innocent victims continues long after the wars have ended.
0x1a3e49: It is easy to plant the mines, you see, but removing them is a different matter.
0x1a3eaa: It requires more time and manpower than anyone is willing to invest.
0x1a3efc: The superpowers need to donate more mine detectors and other equipment to remove them. It is the least we could do after laying them.
0x1a5954: Snake, that is a woman's bathroom. You should not be in there!
0x1a59bf: But I saw Meryl go in here.
0x1a59e5: Even so, Snake!
0x1a59ff: This is our only chance to talk alone together. I was sure she was in here...
0x1a6195: A psychic soldier...yes. Although they won't admit it, many countries have paranormal programs and use psychics in their special-ops.
0x1a622e: Psychics range in power from those who can bend spoons to those who can cause natural disasters.
0x1a62bd: But Psycho Mantis is one of the most powerful. Be careful.
0x1a69c8: Snake, do you like the atmosphere there or something? Hurry up and escape!
0x1a6a35: Just because you are locked up does not mean there is no chance of escape.
0x1a6a90: Keep your eyes and ears open and when you see a chance, take it.
0x1a6afd: You should call Campbell and wait for his instructions.
0x1a74a4: What about your equipment? You're not going to leave behind everything you've collected are you? Hurry! Grab your stuff.
0x1a7542: Snake, hurry to the Communications Tower.
0x1a7c54: You have a good view, though your movement is limited...It might be a good place to take out your enemy with your PSG-1.
0x1a8a45: Snake, I am detecting high levels of radiation coming from that waterfall. If you get too close you could be exposed.
0x1a8ace: Besides the dismantled warheads, Shadow Moses Island must also be storing some other kind of nuclear materials.
0x1a8b51: Whatever it is, it must be leaking...
0x1a8b81: You have probably heard it before, but I will tell you again. Most nuclear storage facilities aren't in much better shape than this one.
0x1a8c1d: They're causing immeasurable damage to the environment.
0x1a9357: You are under long-distance attack. Shoot back with your sniper rifle.
0x1a9bc8: Sniper Wolf....It is pretty unusual for a sniper to announce their presence before they shoot. She must have a real thing for you.
0x1a9c5e: Anyway, I do not think it is going to be as easy as before.
0x1b02cb: Get on your stomach. Fire from the prone position. It would be good if you had a tri pod or something stable to balance your weapon on.
0x1b0366: If you don't have that, hold the weapon firmly under your armpit and keep it still with your chin. Line up your target in your scope's crosshairs.
0x1b042a: Most soldiers can hit a target at 300 meters. I have a friend who can hit one at 520 meters.
0x1b04b5: To be a good sniper, you must have nerves of steel and lots of patience. Sometimes you have to sit in position for days, barely moving a muscle.
0x1b0559: The most important thing is to wait for your opportunity and then take it.
0x1b05cf: A slight tremor in your hand can cause you to miss a target 60 meters away by a half foot or more.
0x1b0642: Concentrate, hold your breath and try to stop your hand from moving.
0x1b06b3: The most important thing is to zero your rifle scope.
0x1b06f6: If you do not zero your sight correctly, you will never be able to hit your target.
0x1b075a: Your sight might be slightly off, so it would be a good idea to try a test shot. If it is off, you will have to take some lead for that when you shoot.
0x1b0805: Don't worry. This was Sniper Wolf's rifle.
0x1b083d: Da. In that case, you had better not mess with it.
0x1b089c: At a distance of 400 meters, a one degree difference in air temperature will take you about 1 centimeter off your target.
0x1b0929: Atmospheric pressure will affect your shot in the same way. That is why you have to aim differently depending on the conditions.
0x1b09db: Have you ever heard of the Magnus Effect? Normally, a rifle bullet rotates and curves slightly to the right. That is called the Magnus Effect.
0x1b0a7d: Think about comrade Magnus when you are lining up your crosshairs.
0x1b10a4: Stay out of his way. You have got to hide and attack. Try a Remote Controlled Missile or your C4 explosives.
0x1b1146: Snake, be careful!
0x1b1163: There are Claymore mines around there.
0x1b1197: Use a Mine Detector!
0x1b11fc: Just call me Deepthroat .
0x1b1223: Deepthroat?
0x1b1239: The informant from the Watergate scandal?
0x1b1270: Never mind about that.
0x1b1291: You're not using burst transmission.
0x1b12c0: Are you nearby?
0x1b12da: Listen. There's a tank in front of your position waiting to ambush you.
0x1b132f: Who are you anyway?
0x1b134d: One of your fans.
0x1b1366: DEEPTHROAT
0x1b13bf: Snake, watch out!
0x1b13db: That place is filled with gas.
0x1b1404: Also, the floor is electrified.
0x1b142e: First destroy the high-voltage switch.
0x1b145f: It's the switchboard on the northwest wall.
0x1b1498: But how? I can't reach it.
0x1b14bd: Use a Remote-Controlled Missile.
0x1b168b: Snake, there's a bomb planted in your items!
0x1b1722: One of them?
0x1b1739: You'll find out soon enough.


III. Briefing and more Codec text
-------------------------------------

0x39f0: It's been a long time, Snake.
0x3a20: I should have known you were behind this, Colonel.
0x3a64: That's no way to greet an old war buddy, Snake.
0x3aa8: What do you want from me?
0x3ad4: I just invited you here so we could have a talk.
0x3b18: Invited!?
0x3b34: That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me?
0x3b7c: Sorry if they were a little rough with you.
0x3bbc: But we've got a serious situation here.
0x3bf8: Only you can get us out of it.
0x3c28: I'm retired from FOX-HOUND.
0x3c54: You're not my commander anymore
0x3c84: and I don't have to take orders from you or anyone else.
0x3cd0: You will take these orders.
0x3cfc: I know it.
0x3d18: Excuse me...
0x3d38: Who's this?
0x3d54: Dr. Naomi Hunter.
0x3d78: She's chief of FOX-HOUND's medical staff
0x3db4: and an expert in gene therapy.
0x3de4: Are you military?
0x3e08: No, civilian.
0x3e28: I've been sent here from ATGC.
0x3e58: Pleasure to meet you, Snake.
0x3e88: Don't worry,
0x3ea8: this injection won't hurt a bit.
0x3edc: What's the shot for?
0x3f04: What's wrong?
0x3f24: You don't like shots?
0x3f4c: Snake, listen up.
0x3f70: It all went down five hours ago.
0x3fa4: Heavily armed soldiers occupied Shadow Moses Island,
0x3fec: a remote island off the coast of Alaska.
0x4028: What soldiers?
0x4048: Next-Generation Special Forces
0x4078: led by members of Unit FOX-HOUND.
0x40ac: They've presented Washington with a single demand
0x40f0: and they say that if it isn't met,
0x4124: they'll launch a nuclear weapon.
0x4158: A nuclear weapon?
0x417c: I'm afraid so.
0x419c: You see, the island is the site of
0x41d0: a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility.
0x158558: FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon!?
0x158590: Now you understand how serious the situation is.
0x1585d4: You'll have two mission objectives.
0x158608: First you're to rescue the DARPA Chief Donald Anderson
0x158650: and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker.
0x158690: They're both being held as hostages.
0x1586c8: Those are some heavy duty hostages.
0x158700: Secondly,
0x15871c: you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have
0x158768: the ability to launch a nuclear strike
0x1587a0: and stop them if they do.
0x1587cc: Any questions, Snake?
0x1587f4: Questions?
0x158810: I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission.
0x158858: Well, you can make up your mind
0x158888: after you hear more about the situation.
0x1e4918: Tell me about the nuclear weapon disposal facility.
0x1e4960: The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base.
0x1e49b0: Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment
0x1e4a00: we can't tell what's happening inside.
0x1e4a38: So someone needs to penetrate,
0x1e4a68: gather intelligence and report back.
0x1e4aa0: Sounds like a spy movie...
0x1e4acc: What's the insertion method?
0x1e4afc: Well, an air insertion is impossible.
0x1e4b34: Not with this storm going on.
0x1e4b64: We'll approach the disposal facility by sub.
0x1e4ba4: Approach?
0x1e4bc0: Yes,
0x1e4bd8: within a few miles of it.
0x1e4c04: The facility is equipped with sonar detection capabilities.
0x1e4c54: They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise.
0x1e4c9c: And then?
0x1e4cb8: We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle).
0x1e4d00: Launch?
0x1e4d18: Same as a torpedo.
0x1e4d3c: Only this has no propulsion device of its own.
0x1e4d7c: After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it.
0x1e4dc4: From there on you'll have to swim.
0x1e4df8: You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?
0x1e4e38: Don't worry.
0x1e4e58: That suit represents the latest advances in poly-thermal technology.
0x1e4eb0: The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island.
0x1e4f00: I'll instruct you by Codec after you reach your target.
0x1e4f4c: Anyone going with me?
0x1e4f74: As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.
0x1e4fb8: Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?
0x1e4ffc: Yes.
0x1e5014: This is a top-secret black op.
0x1e5044: Don't expect any official support.
0x2da0dc: The chief of DARPA
0x2da100: and the president of an arms manufacturing company...
0x2da148: What business did they have
0x2da174: at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?
0x2da1b0: ...The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted
0x2da1fc: at the time the terrorist group attacked.
0x2da238: Must be extremely important exercises
0x2da270: if those two were directly involved.
0x2da2a8: Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?
0x2da2f0: I'm not privy to that information.
0x2da324: Do we know exactly where they're being held?
0x2da364: The DARPA Chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter.
0x2da3b8: As you get closer, you should be able to pick up
0x2da3fc: his location on your radar.
0x34610c: Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?
0x34615c: They say they do.
0x346180: They even gave us the serial number of
0x3461b8: the warhead they plan to use.
0x3461e8: Was the number confirmed?
0x346214: I'm afraid so.
0x346234: At the very least, they've got their hands
0x346270: on a real nuclear warhead.
0x34629c: Isn't there some kind of safety device
0x3462d4: to prevent this type of terrorism?
0x346308: Yes,
0x346320: every missile and warhead in our arsenal
0x34635c: is equipped with a PAL
0x346384: which uses a discrete detonation code.
0x3463bc: PAL?
0x3463d4: 'Permissive Action Link'
0x346400: The safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems.
0x346454: But even so, we can't rest easy.
0x346488: Why not?
0x3464a4: Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code.
0x3464e8: But even if they have a nuclear warhead,
0x346524: it must have been removed from its missile.
0x346564: All the missiles on these disposal sites
0x3465a0: supposed to be dismantled.
0x3465cc: It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM.
0x346610: That used to be true,
0x346638: but since the end of the Cold War,
0x34666c: you can get anything
0x346694: if you have enough money and the right connections.
0x407100: So, what exactly are they demanding?
0x407138: A person's remains.
0x40715c: Remains?
0x407178: That's right.
0x407198: To be more accurate,
0x4071c0: cell specimens, which contain the individual's genomic information.
0x407218: Cell specimens?
0x407238: Why would they want that?
0x407264: The terrorists need them.
0x407290: You see, these Next-Generation Special Forces
0x4072d0: have been strengthened through gene therapy.
0x407310: Strengthened?
0x407330: You've heard of the Human Genome Project.
0x40736c: They've been mapping the human genome
0x4073a4: and they're nearly finished.
0x4073d4: Following up on this research,
0x407404: the military has been working towards identifying those genes
0x407454: which are responsible for making effective soldiers.
0x40749c: There are genes that do that?
0x4074cc: Yes.
0x4074e4: And using gene therapy,
0x40750c: they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers.
0x40755c: Gene therapy?
0x40757c: I'll explain this part.
0x4075a4: With gene therapy, we can remove those genes
0x4075e4: which we know may lead to sickness or disease,
0x407624: and at the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects,
0x407674: such as resistance to cancer for example.
0x4076b0: In other words,
0x4076d0: we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases,
0x407710: and at the same time,
0x407738: add genetic characteristics as desired.
0x407774: O.K.
0x40778c: And so, if you knew what genes were responsible
0x4077d0: for making the perfect soldier,
0x407800: you could implant them in the same way, right?
0x407840: Yes...we could.
0x407860: But, it all depends on being able to isolate
0x4078a0: and identify those "soldier genes".
0x4078d8: And, in order to do that,
0x51bb48: it's helpful if you can study the genomic information of
0x51bb94: one of the greatest soldiers ever.
0x51c972: ]Km>l^/;
0x52d8e4: One of the greatest soldiers ever?
0x52d918: The man they called the greatest warrior of the 20th century...
0x52d96c: You don't mean Big Boss!?
0x52d998: That's right.
0x52d9b8: We've been working feverishly to identify the genes
0x52da00: responsible for his incredible combat skill.
0x52da40: So far, we've discovered about 60 of the so-called
0x52da84: "soldier genes".
0x52daa8: So, his body was recovered after all.
0x52dae0: Yes,
0x52daf8: and his cells have remained frozen in a cryo-chamber.
0x52db40: His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind.
0x52db90: Priceless to the military perhaps.
0x52dbc4: His body was burned severely,
0x52dbf4: but it was possible to restore his DNA profile
0x52dc38: from just a single strand of his hair.
0x52dc70: You people are amazing.
0x52dc98: And then, you're gonna transplant those genes into soldiers?
0x52dd00: we'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting.
0x52dd50: The strongest soldiers don't become what they are
0x52dd94: by acquiring their skills through training or experience.
0x52dde0: We now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial
0x52de2c: for creating superior soldiers.
0x52de5c: Snake,
0x52de74: we can't give them his body.
0x52dea4: It's potentially more dangerous than all the nuclear warheads
0x52def4: on that island put together.
0x52df24: I hear the terrorists are calling themselves
0x52df64: "The Sons of Big Boss".
0x52df8c: "The Sons of Big Boss"
0x612884: What's the time limit?
0x6128ac: 24 hours.
0x6128c8: They say they'll launch after 24 hours.
0x612904: Do they say what the target will be?
0x61293c: So far they haven't mentioned the target.
0x612978: When did the countdown start?
0x6129a8: 5 hours ago.
0x647158: Colonel, who are you speaking for?
0x64718c: Naturally I'm representing the U.S. Government.
0x6471d0: So who's in supervisory control of this operation?
0x647214: ...The President of the United States.
0x64724c: Which means that the President must be meeting
0x64728c: with his top aides in the Map Room about now, huh?
0x6472d0: No, at this point they're still video conferencing with each other.
0x647328: If that's a real nuclear warhead,
0x64735c: shouldn't they issue a COG?
0x647388: Not yet.
0x6473a4: The Secretary of Defense has operational control
0x6473e8: and is fully aware of the situation.
0x647420: After you infiltrate,
0x647448: if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities,
0x647494: a COG will be issued.
0x6474bc: Well if they haven't relocated
0x6474ec: to the nuclear shelter under Mount Washington,
0x64752c: I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet.
0x647574: Is the National Security Agency in on this?
0x6475b4: Yes and so is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency.
0x647600: The DIA?
0x64761c: I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.
0x64765c: They'll be sending us some support.
0x647690: We don't need desk jockies.
0x6476bc: We need a nuclear weapons specialist.
0x6476f4: Of course.
0x647710: A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us.
0x7250c4: We need backup from a specialist.
0x7250f8: I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons.
0x725140: I know.
0x725158: That's why I've requested the assistance of
0x725198: a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko.
0x7251d8: She'll be providing you backup by Codec.
0x725214: A female analyst?
0x725238: She's built up an impressive record as an advisor
0x72527c: for the Nuclear Emergency Search Team.
0x7252b4: Contact her if you have any questions.
0x7252ec: She's also an expert on hi tech weapons.
0x725328: Where's she working from?
0x725354: At her home in Los Angeles.
0x725380: California...
0x7253a0: Seems like a million miles away...
0x7a48a4: How well armed are these terrorists?
0x7a48dc: I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted.
0x7a4930: They're heavily armed, I'm afraid.
0x7a4964: What about their battle experience?
0x7a4998: The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans.
0x7a49ec: They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds.
0x7a4a34: I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND.
0x7a4a78: The others are Next-Generation Special Forces.
0x7a4ab8: They're not your average grunts, either.
0x7f30f4: Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces.
0x7f313c: They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit
0x7f3184: made up of former members of biochem units,
0x7f31c4: technical escort units
0x7f31ec: and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team.
0x7f3224: Their purpose was to respond to threats
0x7f3260: involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction,
0x7f32a8: including NBC weapons.
0x7f32d0: Until "they" were added, that is.
0x7f3304: Who's "they"?
0x7f3324: These guys didn't start out as regular army.
0x7f3364: Looks like a pretty international group.
0x7f33a0: Mercenaries?
0x7f33c0: Yeah,
0x7f33d8: and it gets worse.
0x7f33fc: Most of them were from a merc agency
0x7f3434: that I think you're familiar with.
0x7f3468: They were part of Big Boss's private guard.
0x7f34a8: And after Big Boss went down,
0x7f34d8: the military just bought out all their contracts.
0x7f351c: Outer Heaven...
0x7f353c: After that,
0x7f3558: they were merged with our own VR Unit, "Force 21",
0x7f359c: and retrained.
0x7f35bc: If you ask me, these so-called "Next-Generation Special Forces"
0x7f3610: should be called "simulated soldiers".
0x7f3648: They have no real battle experience.
0x7f3680: Video game players, huh?
0x7f36ac: Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy.
0x7f36fc: They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers.
0x7f3744: Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience.
0x7f3798: I thought using genetically modified soldiers was
0x7f37dc: prohibited by international law.
0x7f3810: Yes,
0x7f3828: but those are just declarations, not actual treaties.
0x7f3870: The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit
0x7f38c0: conspired in this attack.
0x90a9b4: How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?
0x90a9fc: They're calling it a revolution.
0x90aa30: Since they all went through the same gene therapy,
0x90aa74: they probably felt closer than brothers.
0x90aab0: They see the unit as their only family.
0x90aaec: The Sons of Big Boss...
0x90ab14: but if they were regular army
0x90ab44: they must have been interviewed periodically by army counselors...
0x90ab98: According to their files,
0x90abc4: they all got straight A's on their psychological tests.
0x90ac10: They all seemed like fine, upstanding, patriotic soldiers.
0x90ac5c: But they all took part in the uprising?
0x90ac98: No.
0x90acac: Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise.
0x90acf8: That's why there was a re-supply of troops.
0x90ad38: Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?
0x90ad84: There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely.
0x90add8: Apparently, they consulted classified information
0x90ae1c: about the soldier genes
0x90ae44: and performed their own gene therapy experiments.
0x90ae88: They can do that even without you?
0x90aebc: Well, our gene therapy process is almost completely automated.
0x90af0c: And besides that, they're all geniuses with IQs over 180.
0x90af58: Even the existence of this genome army
0x90af90: is a national secret of the highest order.
0x90afcc: We had been hoping to investigate this thing quietly
0x90b014: and deal with it behind closed doors.
0x9e98b0: High Tech Special Forces Unit FOX-HOUND.
0x9e98ec: Your former unit...
0x9e9910: and one that I was a commander of.
0x9e9944: An elite group combining firepower and expertise.
0x9e9988: They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them.
0x9e99d4: So they're still around...
0x9e9a00: There are six members of FOX-HOUND
0x9e9a34: involved in this terrorist activity.
0x9e9a6c: Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities.
0x9e9ab4: Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.
0x9e9afc: Decoy Octopus, master of disguise.
0x9e9b30: Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman.
0x9e9b64: And Revolver Ocelot,
0x9e9b8c: specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter.
0x9e9bd8: Looks like a lovely bunch of folks.
0x9e9c0c: Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances...
0x9e9c54: And finally, in charge of them...
0x9e9c88: FOX-HOUND's squad leader,
0x9e9cb4: Liquid Snake.
0x9e9cd4: Liquid Snake?
0x9e9cf4: Yes.
0x9e9d0c: And you're the only person who can stand against him.
0xaad8fc: Liquid Snake?
0xaad91c: Liquid Snake.
0xaad93c: The man with the same code name as you.
0xaad978: Tell me what you know.
0xaad9a0: He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager,
0xaad9dc: the youngest person in the SAS.
0xaada0c: His job was to track down and destroy
0xaada44: mobile SCUD missile launching platforms...
0xaada80: You were there too, I believe.
0xaadab0: Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?
0xaadb04: I was just a kid myself back then.
0xaadb38: The details are classified, but it seems that originally
0xaadb84: he penetrated the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS.
0xaadbd0: He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?
0xaadc1c: But he never once showed his face in Century House.
0xaadc64: He was taken prisoner in Iraq
0xaadc94: and after that there was no trace of him for several years.
0xaadce4: After you retired, he was rescued
0xaadd18: and became a member of FOX-HOUND.
0xaadd4c: I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using code names.
0xaadda8: I don't know his real name.
0xaaddd4: That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it.
0xaade2c: Here's a photo of him.
0xaade54: Pretty shocking, huh?
0xaade7c: His skin tone is different,
0xaadea8: but otherwise you two are exact duplicates.
0xaadee8: I have a twin?
0xaadf08: I don't know the details,
0xaadf34: but it seems so.
0xaadf58: That's why we really need you for this mission.
0xaadf9c: You're the only one who can beat him.
0xaadfd4: Now that I've met you, I know.
0xaae004: You've got something that he doesn't.
0xaae03c: I can see it in your eyes.
0xaae068: Why don't I find that thought more comforting?
0xbe0b40: Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore.
0xbe0b84: Let me go back to Twin Lakes.
0xbe0bb4: Why, Snake?
0xbe0bd0: Is your life in Alaska all that great?
0xbe0c08: There's a dog sled race this week.
0xbe0c3c: Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage.
0xbe0c78: The Iditarod?
0xbe0c98: The longest sled race in the World?
0xbe0ccc: When did you become a dog musher?
0xbe0d00: Right now my fifty huskies are my only family.
0xbe0d40: I've got to take care of them.
0xbe0d70: Don't worry about your dogs.
0xbe0da0: What do you mean?
0xbe0dc4: I'm sorry Snake,
0xbe0de8: but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea...
0xbe0e2c: there's no room for debate.
0xbe0e58: I told you.
0xbe0e74: Even if I do owe you,
0xbe0e9c: I don't owe anything to this army or this country!
0xbe0ee0: You will accept this assignment.
0xbe0f14: Why should I be stupid enough to do that?
0xbe0f50: I'm no patriot.
0xbe0f70: Snake,
0xbe0f88: there's enough dirt in your file, from your days as an agent,
0xbe0fd8: to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man.
0xbe1024: Oh I see...
0xbe1040: blackmail.
0xbe105c: No, Snake.
0xbe1078: I prefer to look at it as
0xbe10a4: helping you come to a decision more easily.
0xbe10e4: But anyway,
0xbe1100: I know you better than that.
0xbe1130: You'd take this assignment even without the threat.
0xbe1178: Why do you say that?
0xbe11a0: You're a natural born soldier.
0xbe11d0: You're not the grow old gracefully type.
0xbe120c: It's the same for all of us who've seen real action.
0xbe1254: The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield.
0xbe12a4: I'm a soldier too.
0xbe12c8: I know those feelings of powerlessness,
0xbe1304: frustration that you feel everyday...
0xbe133c: You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska.
0xcf763c: But you can't race dogs in the snow forever.
0xcf767c: Why don't you come back to us
0xcf76ac: and be a soldier again.
0xcf76d4: You think my life is some kind of a joke?
0xcf7710: Snake,
0xcf7728: I just want to give you back your purpose in life.
0xd2c958: Colonel, you're retired.
0xd2c984: Why are you involved in this?
0xd2c9b4: Because there aren't many people
0xd2c9e8: who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do.
0xd2ca20: Is that really the only reason?
0xd2ca50: I've been soldiering for a long time.
0xd2ca88: I don't know anything else.
0xd2cab4: I guess even though I'm getting a little old,
0xd2caf4: I still love to be in the field.
0xd2cb28: Colonel,
0xd2cb44: you're a lousy liar.
0xd2cb6c: Tell me the real reason.
0xd2cb98: Okay, Snake.
0xd2cbb8: Sorry.
0xd2cbd0: I'll be frank.
0xd2cbf0: A person very dear to me is being held hostage.
0xd2cc34: Who is it?
0xd2cc50: My niece,
0xd2cc6c: Meryl.
0xd9c13c: What was your niece doing here?
0xd9c16c: Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt,
0xd9c1bc: and my niece was one of those called in
0xd9c1f8: as an emergency replacement.
0xd9c228: She looks like you.
0xd9c24c: She's my little brother's girl.
0xd9c27c: He died in the Gulf War,
0xd9c2a8: and since then I've been watching after her.
0xd9c2e8: A personal motive, Colonel...
0xd9c318: that's not very soldierly.
0xd9c344: I'm retired.
0xd9c364: I'm just an old man now...
0xd9c390: and I'm your friend.
0xd9c3b8: Since when are we friends?
0xd9c3e4: I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar.
0xd9c430: With my personality,
0xd9c458: I don't have too many friends.
0xd9c488: That's what I trust about you.
0xd9c4b8: It's what makes you human.
0xd9c4e4: Please, Snake!
0xd9c504: Save my niece, Meryl!
0xd9c52c: All right.
0xd9c548: But I have two conditions.
0xd9c574: Name them.
0xd9c590: One,
0xd9c5a8: no more secrets between us.
0xd9c5d4: I want complete disclosure at all times.
0xd9c610: And two,
0xd9c62c: I'll only accept orders directly from you, Colonel.
0xd9c674: No cutoffs involved, okay?
0xd9c6a0: Agreed.
0xd9c6b8: That's why I was called.
0xd9c6e4: But one thing...
0xd9c708: What?
0xd9c720: I'm not a Colonel anymore,
0xd9c74c: just a retired old warhorse.
0xd9c77c: I understand...
0xd9c79c: Colonel.
0xe8d910: That doctor.
0xe8d930: Is she part of this operation too?
0xe8d964: She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy.
0xe8d9a4: She knows more about those men than anyone else.
0xe8d9e8: You mean you've seen them naked?
0xe8da1c: Make no mistake.
0xe8da40: I'm not a nurse.
0xe8da64: I am a scientist.
0xe8da88: By the way,
0xe8daa4: what was that injection for?
0xe8dad4: It's a combination of nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide
0xe8db28: so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze,
0xe8db74: even at sub-arctic temperatures...
0xe8dba8: Nanomachines?
0xe8dbc8: Not just one kind either.
0xe8dbf4: There are different types
0xe8dc20: which will replenish the supply of adrenaline,
0xe8dc60: nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream.
0xe8dc9c: Now I don't have to worry about food.
0xe8dcd4: I also put some nootropics in there.
0xe8dd0c: Say what?
0xe8dd28: Nootropics.
0xe8dd44: A class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning.
0xe8dd98: It'll make me smarter, huh?
0xe8ddc4: Anything else?
0xe8dde4: Yes,
0xe8ddfc: benzedrine.
0xe8de18: Its a type of stimulant.
0xe8de44: It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours.
0xe8de94: That was quite a cocktail.
0xe8dec0: Anything else in there?
0xe8dee8: Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's
0xe8df28: batteries charged up.
0xe8df50: I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.
0xe8df98: You're welcome.
0xf68090: I need to borrow your scissors.
0xf680c0: What are you going to do?
0xf680ec: Don't worry.
0xf6810c: Just gonna clean myself up a little.
0xf68144: Huh?
0xf6815c: I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists.
0xf929bc: This is Snake.
0xf929dc: Colonel, can you hear me?
0xf92a08: Loud and clear.
0xf92a28: What's the situation, Snake?
0xf92a58: Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.
0xf92aa0: Just as I expected.
0xf92ac4: You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.
0xf92b08: But make sure nobody sees you.
0xf92b38: If you need to, contact me by Codec.
0xf92b70: The frequency is 140.85.
0xf92b9c: When you want to use the Codec, push the Select Button.
0xf92be4: When we need to contact you, the Codec will beep.
0xf92c28: When you hear that noise, press the Select Button.
0xf92c6c: The Codec's receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your ear.
0xf92cc4: No one but you will be able to hear it.
0xf92cfc: Got it. Okay. I'm ready to go.
0x101106c: It's Snake.
0x1011088: I'm in front of the disposal facility.
0x101a074: Excellent, Snake.
0x101a098: Age hasn't slowed you down one bit.
0x1026894: That took a long time.
0x10268bc: I guess you're feeling a little rusty.
0x10268f4: Don't worry.
0x1026914: It's been a while but it's all coming back to me.
0x103c998: How's that Sneaking Suit working out?
0x103c9d0: I'm nice and dry, but it's a little hard to move.
0x103ca14: Bear with it. It's designed to prevent hypothermia.
0x103ca58: This is Alaska, you know.
0x103ca84: Take it easy, I'm grateful.
0x103cab0: If it weren't for your suit and your shot, I would've turned into a popsicle out there.
0x103cb18: An anti-freezing peptide, Snake.
0x103cb4c: All of the Genome Soldiers in this exercise are using it.
0x103cb98: I see. I'm relieved to hear that. Already tested, huh?
0x103cbe0: By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?
0x103cc24: Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.
0x103cc74: The terrorist's radar should have already picked them up.
0x10a1070: Thanks to the VR training I did on board the Discovery.
0x10aa878: There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.
0x10aa8bc: You've got to hurry!
0x10b82a4: Wow...,
0x10b82bc: he must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather.
0x10b8304: Who's that?
0x10b8320: Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.
0x10b835c: This is Mei Ling. She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.
0x10b83c4: She designed your Codec as well as your Soliton radar system.
0x10b8414: Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.
0x10b8460: Nice to meet you, Snake.
0x10b848c: It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.
0x10b84d8: ..........
0x10b84f4: What's wrong.
0x10b8514: Nothing...
0x10b8530: I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so cute.
0x10b85ac: you're just flattering me...
0x10b85dc: No, I'm serious.
0x10b8600: Well I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
0x10b8644: C'mon.
0x10b865c: ..I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...
0x10b86ac: But I'm surprised...
0x10b86d4: You're very frank for a trained killer.
0x10b870c: Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.
0x10b8758: Yeah.
0x10b8770: I'm looking forward to learning about the man behind the legend,...
0x10b87c4: ...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system.
0x117c1a4: The bright dot in the middle is you, Snake.
0x117c1e4: The red dots are your enemies
0x117c214: and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision.
0x117c260: Be careful Snake.
0x117c284: The genome soldiers have highly developed senses of hearing and vision
0x117c2dc: due to their gene therapy.
0x117c308: Make sure you don't let them see you.
0x117c340: First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the DARPA Chief.
0x117c3a0: The DARPA Chief was injected with the same
0x117c3dc: GPS transmitting nanomachines as you.
0x117c414: He should appear on your radar as a green dot.
0x117c454: Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.
0x117c4a8: If he's alive that is...
0x11e6bc8: Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it.
0x11e6c4c: Yes. It gets jammed easily I'm afraid.
0x11e6c84: Yes. It's all made from currently existing technology.
0x11e6ccc: You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance. So be careful.
0x11e6d34: We'll be monitoring your movements by radar,...
0x11e6d74: ...so contact us by Codec anytime you want.
0x11e6db0: Got it. I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.
0x11e6dec: Seriously, Snake.
0x11e6e10: We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice.
0x11e6e6c: I'm also in charge of your mission data.
0x11e6ea8: Contact me if you want me to save your current status.
0x11e6ef0: My frequency is 140.96.
0x11e6f18: It's a dedicated frequency for saving data. Don't forget it.
0x11e6f68: Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.
0x11e6fac: You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find.
0x11e6ffc: I remember. First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here,
0x11e7048: ...and then all my weapons are taken away.
0x11e7084: Imagine yourself put in that position.
0x11e70bc: Well, if you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me.
0x11e7120: I'll hold you to that, Doctor.
0x11e7150: By the way, sorry to disappoint you, but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.
0x11e71b0: How did you do that?
0x11e71d8: In my stomach.
0x11e71f8: Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids.
0x11e724c: Cigarettes? How are those going to help you?
0x11e728c: You never know.
0x12e126c: Wow...,
0x12e1284: he must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather.
0x12e12cc: Who's that?
0x12e12e8: Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.
0x12e1324: This is Mei Ling. She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.
0x12e138c: She designed your Codec as well as your Soliton radar system.
0x12e13dc: Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.
0x12e1428: Nice to meet you, Snake.
0x12e1454: It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.
0x12e14a0: ..........
0x12e14bc: What's wrong.
0x12e14dc: Nothing...
0x12e14f8: I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so cute.
0x12e1574: you're just flattering me...
0x12e15a4: No, I'm serious.
0x12e15c8: Well I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
0x12e160c: C'mon.
0x12e1624: ..I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...
0x12e1674: But I'm surprised...
0x12e169c: You're very frank for a trained killer.
0x12e16d4: Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.
0x12e1720: Yeah.
0x12e1738: I'm looking forward to learning about the man behind the legend,...
0x1399308: We'll be monitoring your movements by radar,
0x1399348: so contact us by Codec anytime you want.
0x1399384: Got it. I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.
0x13993c0: Seriously, Snake.
0x13993e4: We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice.
0x1399440: I'm also in charge of your mission data.
0x139947c: Contact me if you want me to save your current status.
0x13994c4: My frequency is 140.96.
0x13994ec: It's a dedicated frequency for saving data. Don't forget it.
0x139953c: Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.
0x1399580: You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find.
0x13995d0: I remember. First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here,
0x139961c: and then all my weapons are taken away.
0x1399654: Imagine yourself put in that position.
0x139968c: Well, if you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me.
0x13996f0: I'll hold you to that, Doctor.
0x1399720: By the way, sorry to disappoint you, but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.
0x1399780: How did you do that?
0x13997a8: In my stomach.
0x13997c8: Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids.
0x139981c: Cigarettes? How are those going to help you?
0x139985c: You never know.
0x145d994: If you want to get in, there's the front door.
0x145d9d4: It's the fastest way,
0x145d9fc: but there's too much risk of being spotted by the enemy.
0x145da48: I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.
0x145da94: ...One sentry on the left...
0x145dac4: ...and one on the right...
0x145daf0: They're armed with "five five sixers" and pineapples...
0x145db3c: What about the air duct near the door?
0x145db74: There should also be a duct on the 2nd floor.
0x145dbb4: I can't see it from here.
0x145dbe0: I'll let you decide the best COA (course of action).
0x145dc28: I'm counting on you, Snake.
0x151f864: Is this all there is to load?
0x1525860: To the Heliport, huh...
0x152a060: To the canyon, huh...
0x152e068: To nuclear warhead storage, huh...
0x153506c: The snowfield north of the towers, huh...
0x15599d4: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0x1559a1c: Master? What are you doing here?
0x1559a50: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0x1559ab0: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x1559b18: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x1559b58: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0x1559bb8: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x1559c00: Well I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.
0x1559c48: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0x1559cc8: My frequency is 141.80.
0x15df088: ...Caught a damned cold.
0x15df0b4: I hate Alaska.
0x15df0d4: Boy oh boy. That woman is built all right.
0x15f5068: Is that a woman...
0x15f508c: Not him.
0x15fe9c0: Naomi, the Chief! What happened!?
0x15fe9f4: I...I don't know.
0x15fea18: It looked like a heart attack, but...
0x15fea50: A heart attack? No...
0x15fea78: ...Colonel, are you hiding something from me?
0x15feab8: Absolutely not. Snake, you've got to understand.
0x15feafc: This op is security level Red.
0x15feb2c: You need the highest security clearance to get access to the complete file.
0x15feb88: You want me to believe that you're in charge of this op, but you don't have complete access to the file!
0x15fec04: I told you. The Secretary of Defense is in operational control.
0x15fec54: I'm just here as your support...
0x15fec88: ..........
0x15feca4: Snake, we don't have time to debate.
0x15fecdc: Get out of there and find President Baker!
0x177886c: Looks like we'll be a little delayed.
0x178387c: What are you waiting for!!
0x17838a8: Shoot!!
0x17838c0: Don't talk to me like a rookie!
0x1790878: I'm telling you!
0x17a505c: Hey!
0x17a8860: Shut up!
0x17ac864: Hey! Shut up!
0x17ad864: Shut up in there, willya!
0x17b385c: Ooooooo...
0x17b88fc: Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.
0x17b893c: Is it from the nanomachines?
0x17b896c: No, Snake.
0x17b8988: The nanomachines are functioning properly.
0x17b89c4: So what was it?
0x17b89e4: It must have been psychometric interference coming from Psycho Mantis, FOX-HOUND's psychic.
0x17b8a50: Think of it is a mental feedback loop.
0x17b8a88: So that was Mantis...?
0x186b05c: Draw!
0x186e88c: Hiding won't help you.
0x186e8b4: I understand the bullets, you see.
0x186e8e8: I make them go where I want.
0x1871c04: "23D3#323
0x1884894: I love to reload during a battle.
0x18848c8: There's nothing like the feeling of slamming a long silver bullet
0x188491c: into a well greased chamber...
0x189e86c: All right!
0x189e888: I'm alive again!
0x189e8ac: Let's go!
0x18a9078: You better hurry up.
0x18a90a0: The old man's not gonna last too long.
0x18b6068: Don't you want to settle this?
0x18bd07c: I love the smell of cordite...
0x18bd0ac: You know...
0x18bd0c8: that sulfury smell...
0x18cd074: But to you,
0x18cd090: it'll be the smell of your own death.
0x18d8acc: Colonel! Are you listening?
0x18d8af8: Now he's dead too!
0x18d8b1c: ...I have no idea!
0x18d8b40: Don't lie to me!
0x18d8b64: It looked like another heart attack, but...
0x18d8ba0: Some kind of poison!?
0x18d8bc8: Well, there are lots of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.
0x18d8c24: For example potassium chloride or dioxides,,,
0x18d8c64: But we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy.
0x18d8cac: Damn...!
0x18d8cc8: Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!
0x18d8d08: Can I trust her!?
0x18d8d2c: ...More than you can trust me.
0x18d8d5c: ..........
0x18d8d78: Get in contact with her.
0x18d8da4: ...Snake, there's a lot of electrical interference coming from there.
0x18d8dfc: It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us, but normal transmission is probably impossible.
0x18d8e74: Try moving away from that area.
0x18d8ea4: Snake, get a hold of yourself...
0x18d8ed8: Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing!?
0x18d8f30: A member of FOX-HOUND?
0x18d8f58: No...
0x18d8f70: Are you sure?
0x18d8f90: Yes, we have no one like that in our unit.
0x18d8fcc: ...Is that right?
0x18d8ff0: Snake, I'm counting on you.
0x1ae7900: Who are you?
0x1ae7920: I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there.
0x1ae7978: The one from the prison...?
0x1ae79a4: You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?
0x1ae79e0: ......No...it's not him...
0x1ae7a0c: Just exactly who are you?
0x1ae7a38: I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess.
0x1ae7a98: You're came by yourself?
0x1ae7ac4: You think you're some kind of one-man army?
0x1ae9f0e: /L"2/3a0
0x1b29878: You're not even armed.
0x1b298a0: I appreciate your help from before.
0x1b35938: I don't need lectures.
0x1b35960: You're just like your uncle, you know.
0x1b35998: How do you know my uncle?
0x1b359c4: We go way back.
0x1b359e4: What's your name?
0x1b35a08: My name's not important.
0x1b35a34: Aha!
0x1b35a4c: Could you be Snake?
0x1b35a70: Are you Solid Snake?
0x1b35a98: That's what some people called me.
0x1b35acc: The legendary Solid Snake...! You!?
0x1b35b00: Sorry about before...
0x1b35b28: I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys.
0x1b35b68: But I knew you were.
0x1b35b90: How?
0x1b8a8ac: It's your eyes.
0x1b8a8cc: My eyes?
0x1b8a8e8: They're not soldier's eyes.
0x1b8a914: They're rookie's eyes, right?
0x1b8a944: No, they're beautiful, compassionate eyes.
0x1ba7164: Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.
0x1ba71ac: You trying to sweep me off my feet?
0x1ba71e0: Don't worry. You'll land back on them once you meet me.
0x1ba7228: The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid.
0x1ba726c: I don't believe that.
0x1ba7294: Why did you look so surprised when you saw my face?
0x1ba72d8: Because you look just like him.
0x1ba7308: ...You mean the terrorists' leader, Liquid Snake?
0x1ba734c: Yeah, you know him?
0x1ba7370: You're not brothers, are you!?
0x1ba73a0: I have no family.
0x1ba73c4: So what's the deal then?
0x1ba73f0: Who knows. Why don't you ask him?
0x1c07358: But first I want some information.
0x1c0738c: You were involved in this exercise from the beginning.What exactly happened here?
0x1c073f0: I'm sorry. I was captured along with the President Baker right after the terrorist attack.
0x1c0745c: That's okay.
0x1c0747c: But what is this place?
0x1c074a4: I don't think it's just a nuclear weapon disposal facility...
0x1c074f4: Boy oh boy...it's just like them!
0x1c07528: Nobody's told you anything, did they?
0x1c07560: Okay...you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.
0x1c075b8: This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech.
0x1c0760c: This is a civilian base?
0x1c07638: Right. For the development of Metal Gear.
0x1c07674: Colonel!
0x1c07690: FOX-HOUND and the Next- Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead.
0x1c07718: Why FOX-HOUND?
0x1c07738: Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.
0x1c07794: They figured they could help keep it all hush-hush.
0x1c077d8: But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.
0x1c07818: Why just this time?
0x1c0783c: I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program...that's what I heard anyway.
0x1c078d4: Hmmm...sounds kinda fishy...
0x1c07904: So what do you think the terrorists want?
0x1c07940: Sorry, I'm not sure...
0x1c07968: I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started...
0x1c079c0: Oh yeah.
0x1c079dc: That's when he gave you detonation code override keys, right?
0x1c07a2c: That's right.
0x1c07a4c: Amazing you were able to keep'em hidden from the guards.
0x1c07a98: Well...women have more hiding places than men.
0x1c07ad8: Anyway, you met Baker, huh? How's he holding up?
0x1c07b1c: ...He's dead.
0x1c07b3c: What?!
0x1c07b54: Heart attack.
0x1d27dd8: Same as the DARPA Chief...
0x1d2d32c: The Chief died from a heart attack too...?
0x1d2d368: Yeah...Was either of them sick or anything?
0x1d2d3a4: No...not that I heard of.
0x1d2d3d0: Well I don't believe in coincidences.
0x1d2d408: Something funny's going on.
0x1d2d434: Hmmm. Sounds like it.
0x1d2d45c: But I have no idea what.
0x1d2d488: Me neither...yet.
0x1d2d4ac: Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?
0x1d2d4ec: You mean Dr. Emmerich?
0x1d2d514: Yes. Is he still alive?
0x1d2d53c: Probably. He should be in the reserach lab area .......
0x1d2d584: 2nd floor basement?
0x1d2d5a8: Yeah, that's where his lab is.
0x1d2d5d8: I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program.
0x1d2d630: So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway...
0x1d2d678: Then we'd better do something before he finishes.
0x1d2d6bc: You're right.
0x1d2d6dc: In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x1d2d750: You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?
0x1d2d794: It won't be the first time...
0x1d2d7c4: ..........
0x1d2d7e0: What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?
0x1d2d83c: There's a cargo door on the 1st floor of this building that leads to the north.
0x1d2d89c: What's the security level of the door there?
0x1d2d8dc: Five, but its okay...I've got a level five card.
0x1d2d920: Well...
0x1d2d938: I've got to go save the Doctor. You should go...
0x1d2d97c: I'm going with you!
0x1d2d9a0: No way.
0x1d2d9b8: You're still too green. I want you to hide somewhere.
0x1d2da00: I'm not green.
0x1d2da20: Oh yes you are.
0x1d2da40: ...........
0x1d2da5c: You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over.
0x1d2dab4: Good luck doesn't last forever!
0x1e432a0: I don't know what happened. I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.
0x1e432fc: I never had any problems in training...
0x1e43334: But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated...
0x1e433a0: Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different.
0x1e433fc: Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed about being a soldier...
0x1e43458: Everyday of my life, I've trained my mind and body for the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now...
0x1e434e4: So what now? You wanna quit?
0x1e43514: I can't quit.
0x1e43534: I can't allow myself to quit now.
0x1e43568: Listen, Meryl. Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.
0x1e435c0: Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.
0x1e43624: In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions...worst traits come out.
0x1e43678: It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield.
0x1e436cc: But this isn't a war.
0x1e436f4: It's a terrorist action.
0x1e43720: You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.
0x1e43764: The adrenaline in your blood stream is starting to thin out.
0x1e437b4: Just take it easy.
0x1e437d8: But I learned all about combat high at the academy...
0x1e43820: We'll talk about it later.
0x1e4384c: For now, just think about keeping yourself alive.
0x20de190: If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that ather stuff.
0x20de1e0: Okay, let me try to say this another way...
0x20de21c: Stay the hell out of my way.
0x20de24c: Ha ha. You're a real bastard...
0x20de27c: Just like my uncle said.
0x20de2a8: Ha, I told you.
0x20de2c8: Real me is no match for the legend.
0x20de2fc: Ha ha, It looks like you are right.
0x20de330: Okay Snake. I'll be a good girl.
0x20de364: We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.
0x20de39c: Then we'll take care of the detonation code override.
0x20de3e4: Got ya.
0x20de3fc: But listen, I know this area better than you.
0x20de43c: Call me if you have any questions.
0x20de470: Be careful, okay?
0x20de494: After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.
0x215f0b4: Snake, I unlocked the cargo door for you.
0x215f0f0: Thanks. Where are you?
0x215f118: Where - I - can - see - ya.
0x215f144: Don't move around too much.
0x215f170: Don't worry, I'm disguised in this enemy uniform.
0x2180878: You won't be for long with the way you walk.
0x21808b8: What does that mean?
0x218c98c: Oh,... nothing.
0x218c9ac: Listen Snake, the cargo door is like an airlock.
0x218c9f0: It's equipped with infrared sensors. Be careful.
0x218ca34: If an intruder is sensed, gas is released.
0x218ca70: Gas...
0x218ca88: Okay, so we'll meet at the nuclear warhead storage building!
0x218cad8: Wait! You said you'd stay put and be a good girl!
0x218cb1c: I changed my mind.
0x218cb40: Don't get careless. That's when things always turn sour.
0x218cb8c: Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure whether or not I'm cut out to be a soldier.
0x218cbf8: ...I gotta get my hands dirty.
0x218cc28: These guys are professionals. You're gonna get yourself killed.
0x218cc78: ...See ya there!
0x21f7084: Snake, be careful!
0x21f70a8: There are Claymore mines around there.
0x21f70e4: Use a Mine_Detector!
0x22088f4: Who are you?
0x2208914: Just call me Deepthroat .
0x2208944: Deepthroat?
0x2208960: The informant from the Watergate scandal?
0x22089a0: Never mind about that.
0x22089c8: You're not using burst transmission.
0x2208a00: Are you nearby?
0x2208a20: Listen. There's a tank in front of your position waiting to ambush you.
0x2208a7c: Who are you anyway?
0x2208aa0: One of your fans.
0x220abbe: /[?"V34>
0x22460d8: Snake, watch out!
0x22460fc: That place is filled with gas.
0x224612c: Also, the floor is electrified.
0x224615c: First destroy the high-voltage switch.
0x2246194: It's the switchboard on the northwest wall.
0x22461d4: But how? I can't reach it.
0x2246200: Use a Remote-Controlled Missile.
0x22460d8: Snake, watch out!
0x22460fc: That place is filled with gas.
0x224612c: Also, the floor is electrified.
0x224615c: First destroy the high-voltage switch.
0x2246194: It's the switchboard on the northwest wall.
0x22461d4: But how? I can't reach it.
0x2246200: Use a Remote-Controlled Missile.
0x22728d8: Who are you?
0x22728f8: Just call me Deepthroat .
0x2272928: Deepthroat?
0x2272944: The informant from the Watergate scandal?
0x2272984: Never mind about that.
0x22729ac: You're not using burst transmission.
0x22729e4: Are you nearby?
0x2272a04: Who are you anyway?
0x2272a28: One of your fans.
0x22a306c: It's...
0x22a3084: it's a ghost!!!...
0x22a30a8: Uuurgh!
0x22c7888: Now.
0x22c78a0: Make me feel it!
0x22c78c4: Make me feel alive again!
0x22dd078: Snake, you can't defeat me with a weapon like that.
0x22eb884: Pathetic!
0x22eb8a0: The old Solid Snake would never depend on
0x22eb8dc: such a weapon!
0x22fe8b0: Good.
0x22fe8c8: Now we can fight as warriors.
0x22fe8f8: Hand to hand.
0x22fe918: It is the basis of all combat.
0x22fe948: Only a fool trusts his life to a weapon.
0x232309c: Do you remember Snake?
0x23230c4: The feel of battle?
0x23230e8: The clashing of bone and sinew?
0x2340868: Like old times?
0x234806c: That's good, Snake!
0x2351868: Hurt me more!
0x235a868: More! More!
0x2365078: That's it!
0x2365094: I remember. That punch.
0x2373070: I've been waiting for this pain.
0x237d870: You can't defeat me with weapons!
0x2388868: That's good, Snake!!
0x2391868: Hurry up and catch me.
0x239a068: I'm here, Snake!
0x23b6338: Gray Fox...
0x23b6354: Colonel, that Ninja is Gray Fox.
0x23b6388: No doubt about it.
0x23b63ac: Ridiculous.
0x23b63c8: You of all people should know he died in Zanzibar...
0x23b6410: No. He should have died.
0x23b643c: ...but he didn't.
0x23b6460: What!?
0x23b6478: It happened before I joined FOX- HOUND's medical staff.
0x23b64c0: They were using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments.
0x23b6510: I never heard that.
0x23b6534: It happened right after you retired...
0x23b656c: My predecessor, Dr. Clark, was in charge.
0x23b65a8: Dr. Clark?
0x23b65c4: Yes. He started the gene therapy project.
0x23b6600: And where is he now?
0x23b6628: He was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago.
0x23b6670: So what about this soldier?
0x23b669c: Apparently for their test subject, they decided to use the body of a soldier...
0x23b66fc: who was recovered after the fall of Zanzibar...
0x23b673c: And that was Gray Fox?
0x23b6764: But he was already dead!
0x23b6790: Yes. But they revived him.
0x23b67bc: They fitted him with a prototype exoskeleton and kept him drugged for 4 years
0x23b681c: while they experimented on him like a plaything.
0x23b6860: Today's genome soldiers were born from those experiments.
0x23b68ac: That's the sickest thing I ever heard...
0x23b68e8: They used him to test all sorts of gene therapy techniques.
0x23b6934: ...Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
0x23b6978: ...Because it's confidential information.
0x23b69b4: Is that the only reason?
0x23b69e0: ..........
0x268f174: Naomi, what happened to Gray Fox after that?
0x268f1b4: The record says he died in the explosion.
0x268f1f0: I see.
0x268f208: But even if that ninja is Gray Fox, the question is why?
0x268f254: From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was.
0x268f298: Are you saying that he's just a mindless robot?
0x268f2d8: I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the death...
0x268f32c: ...we'll meet again, I know it.
0x268f35c: So you'll fight again?
0x268f384: Until you kill him?
0x268f3a8: Hmmmm...
0x268f3c4: I'd rather not, but maybe that's what he wants...
0x268f408: ..........
0x27d98c4: Meryl, the engineer's okay.
0x27d98f0: That's a relief.
0x27d9914: I want you to look after him.
0x27d9944: Where are you now?
0x27d9968: Very close.
0x27d9984: There she is! Over there!
0x27d99b0: Oh no!
0x27d99c8: Damn...they've spotted me!!
0x27d99f4: Wakkyakkya
0x27d9a10: Meryl! What happened!
0x2804080: Okay. Let's go.
0x28040a0: I know this place better than you.
0x28040d4: I'll be pointman. Follow me...
0x281a068: That's strange. There's no guard.
0x2822064: What happened to the music?
0x282411c: ?..
0x282806c: I'll keep a look out.
0x2828094: Make sure you're ready, okay?
0x2833068: No! Meryl!
0x283b868: Damn! Meryl!
0x2842060: Don't move!
0x2854070: Snake, don't do that! We're going to the Commander's Room.
0x2860874: Snake, what are you doing. Let's go to the Commander's Room.
0x286d070: Snake, let's hurry up and go to the Commander's Room!
0x2878068: Snake, what are you doing?
0x288086c: C'mon, Mr. FOX-HOUND. The commander is waiting.
0x289108c: Ha ha ha! You stupid fool!
0x28910b8: No! Meryl!!
0x28ae068: No! Meryl!!
0x28bc08c: Now let me read your mind.
0x28bc0b8: No...
0x28bc0d0: ...perhaps I should say your past.
0x28d5070: You're a careless man, aren't you?
0x28e1870: And you're a poor warrior as well.
0x28ec06c: And the same goes with traps.
0x28f7874: However you are skillful at eluding traps.
0x290687c: However you are a skilled warrior.
0x29068b0: You like brute force...
0x2919070: But you are careless around traps.
0x2926878: You are extremely cautious around traps.
0x293588c: You are a very methodical man.
0x29358bc: The type that always kicks his tires before he leaves.
0x294f878: And yet you are rather ineffective in battle.
0x295f074: And you need to beware of traps as well.
0x296c874: It seems that you are careful with traps.
0x297b088: You are a highly skilled warrior,
0x297b0bc: well suited to this stealth mission.
0x2990878: However, traps are your weak point.
0x29a0094: You are extremely careful of traps.
0x29a00c8: You are either very cautious,
0x29a00f8: or you are a coward...
0x29bb088: Still don't believe me?
0x29bb0b0: Now I'll read more deeply into your soul.
0x29d1878: Ah...I can see into your mind...
0x29e1074: So you like SUIKODEN?
0x29ef078: So you like AZURE DREAMS?
0x29ff874: You like fighting games, don't you?
0x2a0d074: So you like adventure games?
0x2a1c070: You enjoy role-playing games.
0x2a2a86c: You like action games!
0x2a3586c: You like to play sports games!
0x2a46070: You like arcade games.
0x2a53870: I see that you enjoy Konami games.
0x2a5f870: So you like VANDAL HEARTS.
0x2a6c874: I can read you like an open book!
0x2a7a084: Hmmm. You have saved often.
0x2a7a0b0: You are a prudent person.
0x2a8e084: Hmmm. You have not saved often.
0x2a8e0b4: You are somewhat reckless.
0x2aa2880: Hmmm...Your memory is completely clean.
0x2ab2090: And you are neglecting to save this game as well.
0x2ab20d4: You will regret it.
0x2ac88c0: You still don't believe me!?
0x2ac88f0: I will show you my psychokinetic power.
0x2ac892c: Put your controller on the floor.
0x2ac8960: Put it down as flat as you can... that's good.
0x2af7884: Now I will move your controller...
0x2af78b8: by the power of my will alone!!
0x2b0c080: What do you think now!?
0x2b0c0a8: Can you feel my power now!!!?
0x2b1d06c: The demonstration is over!!
0x2b2886c: You like Castlevania, don't you?
0x2b340b4: You are powerful indeed,
0x2b340e0: but I know your weak point!
0x2b3410c: Meryl.
0x2b34124: Stand right where he can see you...
0x2b34158: and blow your brains out!!!
0x2b5d874: Aaah!!
0x2b5d88c: Stop! Meryl!!
0x2b67074: Why!?
0x2b6708c: Why couldn't I read your mind?
0x2b75074: No!! It cannot be!!
0x2b75098: Noo!!
0x2b85070: Give up!
0x2b8508c: I can read your mind!
0x2b94868: What!? I cannot read you!!
0x2b9d984: Colonel, your niece is going to be okay.
0x2b9d9c0: Thanks, Snake. I owe you one.
0x2b9d9f0: Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing should wear off, right Naomi?
0x2b9da50: Yes...
0x2b9da68: But...why did you go so far out of your way to save her?
0x2b9dab4: For Campbell's sake?
0x2b9daf4: ...maybe it's cause you like her?
0x2b9db28: I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.
0x2b9db70: Oh really? Since when did anybody's death bother you so much?
0x2b9dbc0: Naomi! It's true that Snake has killed a lot of people,...
0x2b9dc0c: ...but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart.
0x2b9dc50: It's okay, Colonel...she's right.
0x2b9dc84: ..........
0x2ce2070: I'll take point. Snake, you follow me.
0x2cef874: Snake, what's wrong? I thought you were good with dogs.
0x2cfc0b4: This place is mined.
0x2cfc0dc: I'll take point again.
0x2cfc104: Stay back, okay?
0x2cfc128: But the radar isn't working.
0x2cfc158: And since we can't use the mine detector either...
0x2cfc19c: Leave it to me.
0x2d1b8e4: So what do you think?
0x2d1b90c: Pretty good, huh.
0x2d1b930: How did you know where the mines were?
0x2d1b968: It sounds weird, but when Mantis dove into my mind
0x2d1b9ac: I was able to see where the mines were placed.
0x2d1b9ec: Are you impressed?
0x2d1ba10: Well...a little bit...
0x2d1ba38: Only a little?
0x2d4d3cc: ...Meryl!..........
0x2d4d3f0: Damn!! Snake, it's a trap!
0x2d4d41c: A sniper's trick to lure you out.
0x2d4d450: The sniper's waiting for you to go and help Meryl so he can pick you off...Don't do it!
0x2d4d4b8: It must be Sniper Wolf...
0x2d4d4e4: FOX-HOUND's best shooter.
0x2d4d510: Sniper usually works in pairs, but this one's alone, huh.
0x2d4d55c: I know her.
0x2d4d578: She can wait for hours, days or weeks. It doesn't matter to her.
0x2d4d5cc: She's just watching and waiting for you to expose yourself.
0x2d4d618: Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long...
0x2d4d658: Snake, can you see Wolf from where you are?
0x2d4d694: There's nowhere to hide between here and the tower...
0x2d4d6dc: ...she must be on the 2nd floor of the tower.
0x2d4d71c: If Wolf is in the Communications Tower, she can see you perfectly! It's the classic sniper's position!!
0x2d4d794: At that distance you won't be able to hit her with a standard weapon either!
0x2d4d7f4: You'll need a sniper rifle!!
0x2d4d824: Colonel! Take it easy.
0x2d4d84c: ...?
0x2d4d864: I'm going to save Meryl no matter what it takes.
0x2d4d8a8: Okay...thanks.
0x2d4d8c8: ..........
0x2d4d8e4: What's wrong, Naomi?
0x2d4d90c: Nothing...
0x2d4d928: ...I'm just surprised you're willing to sacrifice yourself...you've got the genes of a soldier, not a savior.
0x2d4d9a8: You trying to say I'm only interested in saving my own skin?
0x2d4d9f8: I wouldn't go that far, but...
0x2d4da28: I don't know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care.
0x2d4da78: I operate on instinct.
0x2d4daa0: Like an animal?
0x2d4dac0: I'm going to save Meryl. I don't need an excuse.
0x2d4db04: Okay...
0x2d4db1c: And I'm not doing it for someone else either.
0x2d4db5c: I'm going to save Meryl for myself.
0x2d4db90: Colonel, don't worry!
0x2d4dbb8: Snake, thanks.
0x30c02ec: I understand.
0x30c030c: I'm sorry.
0x30e2860: I got her!
0x30e8060: Don't move!
0x30ed0e4: Don't kill him yet...
0x30ed10c: I want him alive.
0x30ed130: Leave it to me.
0x30ed150: I want no more accidents like that DARPA Chief.
0x30ed194: Yes. He's my target. Mine alone.
0x311c91c: Can you hear me, Solid Snake?
0x311c94c: He's tougher than I thought...
0x311c97c: Do you know who I am?
0x311c9a4: I always knew that one day I would meet you.
0x311c9e4: The man who stole what was rightly mine...
0x311ca20: the man who stole my birthright.
0x31658a0: It's no use.
0x31658c0: We've taken away all your weapons and items.
0x3165900: Don't worry, they're safe.
0x316592c: But you won't be needing them anymore.
0x3187870: Don't make me laugh.
0x3187898: These shackles are steel.
0x3194874: Forget it.
0x3194890: Your body is strapped down tight.
0x31a20ec: Me?
0x31a2100: I'm the man you stole everything good from.
0x31a2140: And now,
0x31a215c: after the sacrifice of our brothers... after 30 long years,
0x31a21ac: finally the two of us meet.
0x31a21d8: The brother of light
0x31a2200: and the brother of dark.
0x31e5104: Do you need his DNA too?
0x31e5130: Yes.
0x31e5148: I want a sample while he's still alive.
0x31e5184: We need it to correct the Genome Soldiers' mutations.
0x31e51cc: Then we'll be able to cure them?
0x31e5200: No.
0x31e5214: We still have to get our hands on Big Boss's DNA.
0x3222960: Have they given in to our demands yet?
0x3222998: Not yet.
0x32229b4: They won't give in.
0x32229d8: They're all hypocrites, every one of them.
0x3222a14: Is that your opinion as a Kurd?
0x3222a44: They always put politics first.
0x3222a74: That's right.
0x3222a94: That's why they want to avoid 
0x3222ac4: any leak about their precious new nuclear weapon.
0x3222b08: Boss, it looks like our friend is awake.
0x32728c4: Press the O button repeatedly to regain your strength.
0x327290c: When you've had enough, press the Select Button to submit.
0x3272958: When your life reaches zero, the game is over.
0x3272998: There are no continues, my friend.
0x32a2078: Don't even think about using auto-fire or I'll know.
0x32b18e8: Snake, it's been a long time since you saved your game.
0x32b1934: Yeah? So what?
0x32b1954: If you're body can't survive the torture, it'll be game over.
0x32b19a4: You really wanna travel down that long road again?
0x32b19e8: C'mon I won't tell.
0x32b1a0c: Why don't you just give up?
0x32b2bae: 43BdSwCe$SA
0x32e7194: I'm going to run a high voltage electric current through your body.
0x32e71ec: If it's just for a short time, it won't kill you.
0x32e7230: Did you know that it was the French
0x32e7264: who first thought of using electrical shocks
0x32e72a4: as a means of torture?
0x32e72cc: I've seen lots of French films, but I never heard that before.
0x32e731c: You're a tough guy, Snake.
0x32e7348: But I got some bad news for you.
0x32e737c: You're no POW.
0x32e739c: You're a hostage.
0x32e73c0: There's no Geneva Convention.
0x32e73f0: No one is coming to save you.
0x32e7420: Startin' to feel a little scared?
0x32e7454: Good...
0x32e746c: you should be.
0x32e748c: Okay.
0x32e74a4: Let's get started.
0x32ff91c: But I never heard that before.
0x32ff94c: You're a tough guy, Snake.
0x32ff978: But I got some bad news for you.
0x32ff9ac: You're no POW.
0x32ff9cc: You're a hostage.
0x32ff9f0: There's no Geneva Convention.
0x32ffa20: No one is coming to save you.
0x32ffa50: Startin' to feel a little scared?
0x32ffa84: Good...
0x32ffa9c: you should be.
0x32ffabc: Okay.
0x32ffad4: Let's get started.
0x334b864: How did you like that?
0x3353064: Had enough yet?
0x3359870: You still okay?
0x3359890: Want me to go on?
0x336686c: Give up.
0x3366888: Make it easy on yourself.
0x3372074: C'mon.
0x337208c: You don't wanna die like this, do you?
0x337f868: Okay. Here we go.
0x3389068: Shall we go again?
0x3391868: We're not finished yet.
0x339b068: Can you take one more?
0x33a5064: One more time.
0x33ad06c: I could do this all day.
0x33b785c: Ha ha ha ha ha!
0x33be868: Still hanging on?
0x33c7864: Why don't you give up?
0x33d187c: You're a strong man.
0x33d18a4: Well, that's enough for now I think.
0x33e28dc: You're the Boss's brother all right.
0x33e2914: Your brother...he's an amazing man.
0x33e2948: Who else could shoot down two F-16s with a Hind helicopter.
0x33e2998: The "Les enfants terribles" project was not a total failure.
0x33e29e8: He is the one man who could make my dream into a reality...
0x341f9c8: We live in a sad age.
0x341f9f0: Imperialism,
0x341fa10: totalitarianism,
0x341fa34: perestroika...
0x341fa54: 20th century Russia had its share of problems,
0x341fa94: but at least they had an ideology.
0x341fac8: Russia today has nothing.
0x341faf4: They're struggling between freedom and order.
0x341fb34: And with that struggle,
0x341fb5c: a new spirit of nationalism has been born.
0x341fb98: The Boss has a close friend high up in the Russian government.
0x341fbe8: He's currently the head of the Spetsnaz.
0x341fc24: He's agreed to purchase this new nuclear weapons system.
0x341fc70: The Hind was just a downpayment.
0x341fca4: So you're in this for money?
0x341fcd4: I don't need money.
0x341fcf8: I want Russia to be reborn...
0x341fd28: ...to lead a brave, new world order.
0x34a2974: You're a soldier. You should understand.
0x34a29b0: You and I can't continue to live in a world like this.
0x34a29f8: We need tension...
0x34a2a1c: ...conflict.
0x34a2a3c: The world today has become too soft.
0x34a2a74: We're living in an age where true feelings are suppressed.
0x34a2ac0: So we're going to shake things up a bit.
0x34a2afc: We'll create a world dripping with tension...
0x34a2b3c: ...a world filled with greed and suspicion,
0x34a2b7c: bravery and cowardice.
0x34a2ba4: ..You want the same thing that we do.
0x34a2bdc: Liquid Snake is the one.
0x34a2c08: He is an incredible man.
0x34a2c34: He is the man who can really make it happen.
0x3522108: Had enough?
0x3522124: So you're human after all.
0x3522150: The torture will stop as I promised.
0x3522188: But I'll take the woman in return.
0x35221bc: I'll have my fun with her before I kill her.
0x35221fc: ...Meryl.
0x3522218: I hope you can still look at yourself in the mirror,
0x3522260: my friend.
0x3566874: Snake. It's show time.
0x356689c: Ocelot wants you.
0x3575870: Okay.
0x3575888: I'll tell you once more.
0x3582968: I've fought wars in Afghanistan,
0x358299c: Mozambique, Eritrea, and Chad.
0x35829cc: Among the Mujahaddin guerrillas,
0x3582a00: I was known and feared as "Shalashaska". 
0x3582a3c: I was trained by the Russian GRU.
0x3582a70: I am not like one of those KGB slugs.
0x3582aa8: To me, this isn't torture....
0x3582ad8: It's a sport.
0x3582af8: You're all just a bunch of sadists.
0x3582b2c: Don't confuse me with those uniformed fools.
0x3582b6c: Well...
0x3582b84: ...shall we begin?
0x35e3884: Snake, are you okay?
0x35e38ac: I've been better...
0x35e38d0: How's Meryl?
0x35f4408: Why did you try to hide it?
0x35f4434: ...I'm sorry...
0x35f4454: Can't tell the grunts, huh...
0x35f4484: ...You've changed a lot.
0x35f44b0: Metal Gear...secret advanced nuclear weapons research...
0x35f44fc: Does the White House know about this? How deep does it go?
0x35f4548: ...As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not been briefed about the Rex Project.
0x35f45b8: `Need to know basis`, is that the idea?
0x35f45f0: These are sensitive times. Even sub- critical nuclear tests are causing quite a stir.
0x35f4658: Plausible deniability, huh.
0x35f4684: Yes.
0x35f469c: And tomorrow, the President and his Russian counterpart are scheduled to sign the Start Three Accord.
0x35f4714: I get it. That's the reason for the deadline.
0x35f4754: That's right, Snake.
0x35f477c: And that's why we can't let this terrorist attack go public.
0x35f47cc: We still haven't even ratified Start Two or dealt with the issue of TMDs.
0x35f4828: This has to do with the President's reputation and America's place as the dominant superpower.
0x35f4898: So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?
0x35f48ec: Please Snake, just stop them...
0x35f491c: Why should I?
0x35f493c: Because you're the only one who can.
0x35f4974: In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead.
0x35f49cc: I told you before. I don't know the details.
0x35f4a0c: I don't believe you.
0x35f4a34: ..........
0x35f4a50: If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands?
0x35f4aa8: Let them have Big Boss's remains.
0x35f4adc: You see...
0x35f4af8: Or is there some reason that you can't do that?
0x35f4b38: Something you havent told me about?
0x35f4b6c: Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to eugenics experiments.
0x35f4bd4: We don't want the existence of the genome army to go public.
0x3720ea4: And that's the only reason?
0x3720ed0: ..........
0x372ab38: Huh! The hell with you!
0x372ab60: I'm sorry...
0x372ab80: The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me.
0x372abd0: Poor man.
0x372abec: But it's strange. He looks and smells like he's been dead for days.
0x372ac40: All his blood's been drained out too.
0x372ac78: Drained!?
0x372ac94: Maybe to slow down decomposition?
0x372acc8: I have no idea.
0x372ace8: But the Chief only died a few hours ago, right?
0x372ad28: Right.
0x372ad40: But he's already started to decompose.
0x372ad78: What could it all be about?
0x372ada4: Something in his blood that they wanted?
0x372ade0: I doubt it. Just the nanomachines and the transmitter.
0x372ae28: Did the Chief tell them his detonation code?
0x372ae68: I'm afraid so. It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch.
0x372aecc: Damn. Is there any way to prevent it?
0x372af04: It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.
0x372af78: It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.
0x372afc0: You have to unlock it with three special card keys.
0x372b004: And where are those keys?
0x372b030: I've got one of them. I don't know where the other two are.
0x372b07c: Besides, I'm locked up here.
0x372b0ac: We've got no choice. Forget about the keys.
0x372b0e8: Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.
0x372b130: I'm sorry to have to lay it all in your lap, but you're all I've got.
0x372b188: Bust out of there and get to the Communications Tower.
0x38198b0: Also...
0x38198c8: What?
0x38198e0: I know it's asking a lot...
0x381990c: Meryl, right?
0x381992c: Yeah...
0x3819944: I'll save her.
0x3819964: Thanks.
0x383e06c: ...They've got her.
0x383e090: Damn...!
0x38438e1: b !
0x384710c: Snake,...
0x3847128: ...the government has decided not to give in to their demands.
0x3847178: We're trying to buy some more time.
0x38471ac: C'mon Colonel,...
0x38471d0: ...why don't you stop playing dumb?
0x3847204: I'm sorry about Meryl. But I want the lies to end now.
0x384724c: What are you talking about?
0x3847278: Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead, wasn't it?
0x38472e8: You knew it all along, didn't you.
0x384731c: ..........
0x388b860: You okay, Snake?
0x38900c8: Yeah, my arm hurts...
0x38900f0: ...Poor Snake.
0x3890110: I'll increase the level of pain killers in your blood.
0x3890158: Okay, but you can leave out the benzedrine.
0x3890194: That stuff makes me too frisky.
0x38901c4: I guess you're not feeling too bad after all.
0x38ba8fc: Snake, put the controller up against your arm.
0x38ba93c: What?
0x38ba954: Don't worry. It'll feel good.
0x38ba984: Huh?
0x38ba99c: Okay, here I go.
0x38ba9c0: Ooooh.
0x38ba9d8: How does that feel, Snake?
0x38baa04: A little better?
0x38baa28: How did you do that?
0x38baa50: I stimulated your muscle fibers with the nanomachine's cilia.
0x38baaa0: That's about all I can do for you...
0x3903b48: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x3903b74: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x3903bb0: What can I say?
0x3903bd0: Anything.
0x3903bec: I...I'm not a very good talker...
0x3903c20: Please...
0x3903c3c: tell me about yourself.
0x3903c64: Myself?
0x3903c7c: ...That's a tough one.
0x3903ca4: Any family?
0x3903cc0: ...That's not a happy topic for me.
0x3903cf4: I don't have any family... 
0x3903d20: No wait, there was a man who said he was my father...
0x3903d68: Where is he?
0x3903d88: Dead.
0x3903da0: ...by my own hand.
0x3903dc4: Big Boss.
0x3903de0: What!? Big Boss!!? I had no idea.
0x3903e14: There was no way you could.
0x3903e40: It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago.
0x3903e78: Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.
0x3903ec8: So...is it true?
0x3903eec: Was Big Boss really your father?
0x3903f20: That's what he said...
0x3903f48: That's all I know.
0x3903f6c: And you were able to kill him, knowing that?
0x3903fac: Yup.
0x3903fc4: How?
0x3903fdc: He wanted it.
0x3903ffc: Besides, some people just need killing...
0x3904038: That's patricide...!
0x3904078: That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.
0x39040bc: The one we share in common.
0x39040e8: Is that why you left FOX-HOUND?
0x3904118: Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska was the perfect place...
0x3904184: ...Snake.
0x3c4f1c8: ...I didn't have a real family either.
0x3c4f200: Just a big brother who put me through school.
0x3c4f240: We weren't even blood-related and he was much older than me.
0x3c4f290: Where is he?
0x3c4f2b0: ...He's dead...
0x3c4f2d0: I'm sorry...
0x3c4f2f0: Snake...
0x3c4f30c: ...is there a woman in your life?
0x3c4f340: After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.
0x3c4f39c: Friends?
0x3c4f3b8: ...Roy Campbell...
0x3c4f3dc: Huh? You're still calling me friend?
0x3c4f414: Is that it?
0x3c4f430: No, there was another...
0x3c4f45c: Frank Jaeger.
0x3c4f47c: What!?
0x3c4f494: Big Boss's most trusted lieutenant
0x3c4f4c8: and the only member of FOX-HOUND ever to receive the codename `Fox`.
0x3c4f520: ...Gray Fox.
0x3c4f540: ..........
0x3ce9ab4: I learned a lot from him...
0x3ce9ae0: But...
0x3ce9af8: ...didn't you try to kill each other?
0x3ce9b30: It's true. We did. In Zanzibar.
0x3ce9b60: But it was nothing personal.
0x3ce9b90: ...we were just professionals on opposite sides, that's all.
0x3ce9be0: And you still call yourself `friends`!?
0x3ce9c18: Hard to believe?
0x3ce9c3c: War is no reason to end a friendship.
0x3ce9c74: That's insane.
0x3ce9c94: I first met him on the battlefield.
0x3ce9cc8: He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.
0x3ce9d08: But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.
0x3ce9d44: He was always so cool and precise. I was still green and he showed me the ropes.
0x3ce9da8: You knew him well?
0x3ce9dcc: No. We never talked about our personal lives.
0x3ce9e0c: Sort of an unwritten rule...
0x3ce9e3c: The next time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.
0x3ce9e8c: We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.
0x3ce9ec8: I know it sounds strange to most people.
0x3ce9f04: But we were just two soldiers doing our jobs.
0x3ce9f44: It's like a sport.
0x3ce9f68: Men and their games!
0x3ce9f90: You're like wild animals!
0x3ce9fbc: You're right. We are animals.
0x3ce9fec: So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?
0x3cea044: I don't know.
0x3cea064: It's your genes...they make you predisposed towards violence!
0x3cea0b4: You really like talking about genes, Naomi.
0x3cea0f0: Why did you get into genetic research anyway?
0x3de11d0: ...I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like.
0x3de1224: I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am.
0x3de1288: So you studied about DNA?
0x3de12b4: Yeah. I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.
0x3de1318: I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information,
0x3de1364: I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory.
0x3de13b0: Memory is stored in DNA?
0x3de13dc: We're not sure.
0x3de13fc: But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA.
0x3de1478: So what about my fate?
0x3de14a0: You know my DNA sequence, don't you?
0x3de14d8: Your fate?
0x3de14f4: I...
0x3de150c: ...I'm sorry. I have no idea.
0x3de153c: Of course not.
0x3de155c: You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
0x3de1598: ..........
0x3e70054: ..........
0x3e77880: Yeah...nothing new to report.
0x3e778b0: Snake, is there anything I can do?
0x3e8895c: ..........
0x3e88978: I'm not the right guy. I can't save the world.
0x3e889b8: What's wrong?
0x3e889d8: I gave in to the pain...
0x3e88a04: I'm sorry, Colonel.
0x3e88a28: I sacrificed Meryl to save myself...
0x3e88a60: ...Snake..........
0x3e88a84: She was a soldier. She knew the risks.
0x3e88abc: Battlefield casualties are always tragic, but they're an unavoidable part of war.
0x3e88b20: Don't blame yourself.
0x3e88b48: You still have a mission to do.
0x3fa5054: .........
0x3fb2890: Hachooh!!!
0x3fb28ac: Damn!...I caught a cold...
0x3fb28d8: That witch!
0x3fb28f4: She took my clothes!
0x3fcb884: ooooooooohhhh!!!
0x3fcb8a8: Ooooohh....
0x3fcb8c4: Oh my stomach!!!
0x3fcb8e8: Oh! ...Damn it!!
0x3fcb90c: Mmmmnnnn!!
0x3fe8878: Mmmmnnnn!!!
0x3fe8894: ...not again!!!
0x3fe88b4: ....Uuunnnffff....
0x3ff90ac: That cold medicine knocked me out
0x3ff90e0: ...and it doesn't even work!
0x401687c: I'm so sleepy...
0x40168a0: Maybe if I walk a little...
0x4028068: Aaah!
0x4028080: That's better...
0x403786c: Hey! I'm here!
0x403788c: Where...?
0x403f864: That's all I can do for you, Snake.
0x404588c: Oh jeez...
0x40458a8: He's coming back.
0x40458cc: ...see ya later...
0x405285c: Wait.
0x4055064: Ha!?
0x405507c: He's gone!
0x405d064: What the hell?
0x4062074: What are you playing around with that ketchup for?
0x406c068: What the hell are you doing?
0x4074068: Otacon?
0x4074080: So you are here to get me out.
0x407c85c: The Ninja?
0x4080074: Snake, there's a bomb planted in your items!
0x40800b4: Hurry! Throw it away!
0x408d078: Who the hell are you!?
0x408d0a0: One of them?
0x408d0c0: You'll find out soon enough.
0x4099884: That was a close one, Snake.
0x40998b4: Ocelot...you'll pay for that...
0x40aa8b8: That Deepthroat's a real enigma. He's definitely from inside their ranks.
0x40aa914: Is he an informer?
0x40aa938: Maybe some kind of renegade?
0x40aa968: I've got the feeling there's some other force at work here.
0x40cf8a4: Snake, about Meryl...
0x40cf8cc: Colonel, I'm sorry...
0x40cf8f4: Listen to me.
0x40cf914: I wasn't able to protect her.
0x40ee898: Snake, it's okay.
0x40ee8bc: You did what you could, now let it rest.
0x40ee8f8: Colonel...
0x410c080: Snake...she's a soldier.
0x410c0ac: She knows that prisoners are a part of war.
0x411da7c: She joined up of her own free will.
0x411dab0: I'm sure she was prepared for this.
0x411dae4: No. You're wrong...
0x411db08: .....?
0x411db20: Meryl thought she had to become a soldier...thought it was the only way.
0x411db7c: She said she thought it bring her closer to her dead father.
0x411dbcc: She said that!?
0x411dbec: She wasn't ready for real combat.
0x411dc20: I shouldn't have pushed her so hard. ...It's all my fault.
0x411dc6c: That's not like you, Snake.
0x411dc98: Master? What is it?
0x411dcbc: Sorry for eavesdropping, but I just couldn't listen anymore.
0x411dd0c: Master...
0x411dd28: Snake, you can have regrets if you want to...it's only natural.
0x411dd78: But you can't keep attacking yourself for things that happened in the past.
0x411ddd4: That road leads to madness, believe me.
0x411de0c: He's right.Don't kick yourself.
0x411de3c: It doesn't suit a legend like you.
0x4304870: And besides that, for all we know Meryl's okay, right?
0x430e868: I'm sure Meryl's just fine.
0x4314b94: Mei Ling...
0x4314bb0: Snake, forget about Meryl. Stop Liquid.
0x4314be8: That's what Meryl would want, too.
0x4314c1c: You're right.
0x4314c3c: Meryl would say the same thing.
0x4314c6c: ...Snake?
0x4314c88: What?
0x4314ca0: Meryl...she's pretty special to you, huh?
0x4314cdc: Yes, she's special.
0x4314d00: There aren't many women like her around.
0x4314d3c: ...That's not what I meant...
0x4314d6c: She's the Colonel's niece. ...and a combat buddy.
0x4314db0: Is that all? C'mon...
0x4314dd8: ...This is like a police interrogation.
0x4314e10: No...I just...
0x4314e30: I guess it's in the genes...
0x4314e60: The genes?
0x4314e7c: What are you talking about, Colonel?
0x4314eb4: No, I just remembered about Naomi's grandfather.
0x4314ef8: I think Naomi said he rose as high as assistant secretary in the FBI during Edgar Hoover's time.
0x4314f6c: Is that right?
0x4314f8c: Yes...yes, he was Japanese and he became a special undercover investigator to nab the Mafia.
0x4314ffc: When was that?
0x431501c: Oh...sometime in the 50's, I guess.
0x4315050: Where?
0x4315068: ...New York, I think...
0x4315090: Naomi...I thought that you didn't have any family...
0x43150d8: Well,...I...I researched it after I became an adult.
0x4315120: My grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.
0x4315174: I never even had the chance to meet him...
0x43151b0: Oh...
0x43151c8: ...Snake, good luck.
0x43151f0: Watch your back, Snake.
0x4409098: She was a soldier.
0x44090bc: She knew the risks.
0x44090e0: Battlefield casualties are always tragic, but they're an unavoidable part of war.
0x4425060: Don't shoot!
0x4445068: You're out of missiles!
0x444e870: Don't make me wait. 
0x444e898: Come on out!
0x445c880: You're out of luck!
0x445c8a4: Now I'll send you to hell!!
0x446e9d8: Snake, the elevator's working.
0x446ea08: You fixed it?
0x446ea28: No, that's the weird thing.
0x446ea54: It just moved by itself. It's yourway now.
0x446ea90: Is that so? Okay.
0x446eab4: That explosion before...what was it?
0x446eaec: Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.
0x446eb24: Helicopter? That's incredible, Snake!
0x446eb5c: Listen. I just want to make sure again.
0x446eb94: This is the way to get to where Metal Gear's is being stored?
0x446ebe4: Yeah. The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards the back of the snowfield ahead.
0x446ec58: Okay. Find a safe place to hide out for a while.
0x446ec9c: I'm going underground.
0x446ecc4: I know, I know. You don't have to tell me.
0x446ed00: And stay outta my way. Don't try to be a hero or anything.
0x446ed4c: Okay, call me if you need to.
0x44f8068: Too late, Snake!
0x44f808c: Now die!
0x450022c: Snake, there's something I forgot to tell you before.
0x4500274: What?
0x450028c: There were five stealth camouflage prototypes in my lab.
0x45002d8: Yeah, so?
0x45002f4: If you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four.
0x450033c: Hey! This isn't first grade math class!
0x4500374: I thought I'd get one for you, so I went back to the lab and...
0x45003c4: Yeah?
0x45003dc: The four suits were missing.
0x450040c: ..........
0x4500428: Also...about the elevator that I checked out...
0x4500468: It's really strange.
0x4500490: It was like someone was intentionally holding it.
0x45004d4: When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off?
0x4500528: That's another thing that bothered me about it...
0x450056c: The warning went off and I know I couldn't be over the limit.
0x45005bc: How much do you weigh?
0x45005e4: About 135.
0x4500600: But that elevator had a weight limit of 650 pounds.
0x4500644: It would take at least five people to go over that limit...
0x4500690: L...Look out, Snake!
0x45006b8: The guys who stole my stealth prototypes are in there with you!!!
0x4705404: Snake!! Are you okay?!
0x470542c: Otacon! Were there any other stealth prototypes?
0x4705470: No. There were only five.
0x470549c: So...this isn't stealth camouflage then...
0x47054d8: What are you talking about?
0x4705504: Someone's shooting at me...
0x4705530: in the middle of this blizzard...
0x4705564: ...It's her!!
0x4705584: Wolf?
0x470559c: ....Sniper Wolf?
0x47055c0: Yes it's her!
0x47055e0: ...It's definitely her!
0x4705608: Otacon...you sound like you're happy.
0x4705640: No I'm not.
0x470565c: So then what is it?
0x4705698: ...please don't kill her!
0x47056c4: Are you insane!?
0x47056e8: Please. She's a good person!
0x4705718: You'd know that if you talked to her...
0x4705750: Listen to me, kid. She's a merciless killer.
0x4705790: I can see you perfectly from here.
0x47057c4: I told you...
0x47057e4: I'd never quit the hunt. Now you're mine.
0x4705820: Wolf! No, you can't!
0x4705848: Don't get between a wolf and it's prey!
0x4705880: You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.
0x47058c4: You see? 
0x47058e0: Women naturally make better soldiers.
0x4705918: Wolf! Don't do this!!
0x4705940: Snake, I'm near.
0x4705964: Can't you sense me near you?
0x4705994: It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.
0x47059d8: Is that right?
0x47059f8: Well I'm going to send you a love letter, my dear.
0x4705a3c: Do you know what that is? It's a bullet straight from my gun to your heart. 
0x4705a9c: Please!! Wolf!...Snake!...No!
0x4705ae4: Don't get in our way!
0x4705b0c: Now I'll pay you back for Meryl...
0x4705b40: You men are so weak.
0x4705b68: You can never finish what you start...
0x470c7d2: Dd422Ec 
0x4acc868: What's wrong, Snake!
0x4ada064: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
0x4adf864: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
0x4ae4884: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands.
0x4af60b0: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0x4af6120: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0x4b180c0: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0x4b1813c: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0x4b3f88c: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0x4b530a0: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0x4b6f888: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0x4b82094: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0x4b99088: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0x4bab0a8: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0x4bb1d12: !!$1!!2_
0x4bc9070: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0x4bd389c: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0x4bd3900: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0x4bee878: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0x4bfb9a8: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0x4bfba24: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0x4bfba9c: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0x4bfbb0c: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0x4bfbb8c: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0x4bfbbd8: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0x4bfbc80: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press the Select ( or X ) Button.
0x4c7f890: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas. It represents one breath.
0x4c96880: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0x4ca60c8: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0x4ca612c: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0x4cd20ec: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0x4cd2168: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0x4cd21c0: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0x4d038d0: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0x4d0396c: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0x4d318c8: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0x4d31934: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0x4d31978: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0x4d319b4: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0x4d58a5c: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0x4d58ac4: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0x4d58b10: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0x4d58b8c: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0x4d58be0: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0x4d58c58: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0x4d58ce0: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0x4d58d88: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0x4d58e0c: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0x4d58e4c: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0x4e080ac: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0x4e0814c: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0x4e2a094: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0x4e42890: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0x4e59080: Snake, if you make direct contact with an enemy, you'll take damage. Be careful.
0x4e6a0a0: Snake, don't forget this is a covert operation. There are lots of bad guys and only one of you.
0x4e6a110: If you're spotted, you'll be surrounded before you know it.
0x4e86064: If that happens, you're finished.
0x4e8c088: First go to the elevator in the back and take it up to the ground floor. Then look for the DARPA Chief.
0x4e9f0a0: Snake, you have to crawl to get through there.
0x4e9f0e0: First crouch down by pressing the Crawl Button and then use the Directional button to crawl in the direction you want.
0x4ebc89c: Be careful though. Crawling is slow and you can't attack when you're doing it either.
0x4ebc904: You can stand up by pressing the Crawl Button again.
0x4ed3084: Snake, don't run over puddles. The splashing sound might alert your enemies. Be careful.
0x4ee5870: Snake, there's an elevator there you can take up to the ground.
0x4ef0084: Get on the elevator. It should take you right to the front of the Nuclear Weapon Disposal Facility. Be careful, though.
0x4f03078: You'll just have to wait for the elevator to come down. You'd better hide somewhere.
0x4f10080: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0x4f20090: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0x4f200d8: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0x4f38084: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0x4f4a880: Snake, they're using a searchlight to sweep the area. Make sure you stay out of the beam.
0x4f5a88c: There's no turning back now, Snake. You've got a job to do and you're our only hope. The world is counting on you.
0x4f7007c: It looks like a cargo truck.
0x4f700ac: They must use it for transporting goods around the base.
0x4f7e894: Snake, why don't you try to hide in the truck? If you disguise yourself as part of the cargo, you might be able to use the truck to get around.
0x4f97080: Snake, you'll never be able to get through the front door. Find some other way to get in.
0x4fa7890: That base must have some kind of ventilation system to recirculate the air. There should be air ducts around there somewhere.
0x4fbe0d8: You're not going to believe this, but they shot down the F-16s we were using as a diversion....with a Hind D! Then we got a message from Liquid.
0x4fbe17c: He said if we try something like that again, he'll launch the nuke!
0x4fbe1d0: Snake, hurry up and get in there! That Hind will be coming back soon.
0x4ff10b4: They must need a lot of power to run the base. There's probably a diesel generator somewhere.
0x4ff1124: And since generating electricity requires oxygen, there must be exhaust openings for that too.
0x502007c: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0x502f880: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0x504107c: Don't make too much noise or you'll be spotted. Be careful when you're walking on that floor.
0x505088c: Even though the Genome Soldiers are strengthened by gene therapy, they still need to sleep. You can move safely while they're napping.
0x506789c: The Genome Soldiers were specially trained so they can enter into a light sleep any time and still remain in attack posture.
0x506792c: Be careful not to make noise when you're near them.
0x508208c: When they're yawning, their eyes are closed, so they shouldn't be able to see you. Be careful with your timing and you'll be okay.
0x5097178: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter Weapon Mode .
0x50971f0: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0x5097240: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit Weapon Mode . The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0x50972e0: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0x5097334: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0x50973c8: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0x5107090: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0x511d09c: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha. Her frequency is 141.52.
0x5139070: Her frequency is 141.52.
0x51438b8: Snake, use the elevator to move from floor to floor.
0x5143900: To call the elevator, press the button on the nearby control panel by pressing the Action Button. The elevator should show up in no time.
0x5171078: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0x517f084: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0x5191098: Use the elevator to change floors. To select the floor you want to go to, use the control panel inside the elevator, on the left.
0x51ab098: Press up or down on the Directional Button to choose the floor. Then press the Action Button to confirm or the X Button to cancel.
0x51c407c: Be careful. The elevator won't work in either Alert Mode or Evasion Mode.
0x51d389c: Press up or down on the Directional Button to choose the floor. Then press the Action Button to confirm or press the (^) Button to cancel.
0x51ed8b4: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0x51ed90c: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0x520e880: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there? Hurry up and get him out.
0x521e87c: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?
0x522d088: Snake, that door is protected by a security system. It won't open without the right security card.
0x523f890: You can only open the door with a security card that's got the same or a higher security clearance than the door.
0x52550bc: There must be some other way to get in. Take a look around. The best way to do that is to use First Person View Mode .
0x5255148: Press the First Person View Button to go into First Person View Mode .
0x527c898: Snake, the DARPA Chief's signal is coming from somewhere in that area. Isn't there some place to drop down?
0x527c914: Take a look around in First Person View Mode.
0x5296880: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0x52a80a0: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech,Kenneth Baker, 
0x52a812c: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0x52c4078: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0x52d2068: You better use that weapon you found!
0x52d8868: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0x52e017c: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0x52e021c: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0x52e0298: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0x52e0328: ...I didn't know.
0x52e034c: Really?
0x52e0364: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0x5338894: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0x53500a8: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0x53500e4: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0x5350110: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0x536b09c: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0x536b128: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0x5385074: Did you try hitting the wall? Maybe it'll sound different too.
0x5390090: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0x53a7880: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0x53b8090: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0x53d0094: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0x53d00fc: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0x53e7074: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0x53f3894: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0x540b9f0: If you've got a question about FOX-HOUND, ask Dr. Naomi.
0x540ba3c: Revolver Ocelot is a former member of Spetsnaz.
0x540ba7c: After the fall of the Soviet Union, he apparently served in the Russian Tax Police's elite swat team.
0x540baf4: After that, he joined the SVR, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency, which was formerly a part of the KGB.
0x540bb74: But according to my sources, he was dissatisfied with the rigid system of the KGB and wanted to get out.
0x540bbf0: That's when he was recruited by FOX-HOUND.
0x540bc2c: He's a gun fanatic and totally obsessed with cowboy movies and spaghetti westerns.
0x540bc90: He's also something of a sadist...he learned the most advanced torture techniques while he was with Spetsnaz.
0x540bd10: Yeah, he had plenty of practice. The Lubianka Prison is located right there inside KGB headquarters.
0x5492acb: Ok,
0x5497898: Make sure President Baker doesn't get hurt. If he's killed, it's all over. Try not to cross over that yellow line or you might set off the explosion.
0x54b00d4: In a gunfight, reloading is usually the most dangerous time. But he loves it. Use that to your advantage.
0x54b0150: You'll have to take him out when he's reloading. Can you see where his number of remaining bullets is displayed on the screen?
0x54b01e0: Wait for the right moment and then take him out!
0x54e106c: You might also try to faze him with a Stun Grenade.
0x54e9884: If you get too close to Ocelot, he'll run away and shoot you from distance. So be careful.
0x54fb08c: Don't forget that President Baker is there. He's wrapped up in C4, so don't use any type of explosive near him.
0x550f8a0: Snake, there are gun cameras set up there. If they detect you, they'll open fire.
0x550f904: Stay out of the cameras' field of vision. You could also try to jam them with Chaff.
0x552d080: It looks like the place is protected by infrared sensors. Somehow you'll have to make it past the beams.
0x553e094: Snake. Be careful. There are trap doors near there and the fall will kill you. Stay close up against the wall and you should be okay.
0x5556878: You should be able to see where the trap doors are if you use your Thermal Goggles.
0x5564188: Are you smoking?
0x55641ac: Yeah, so what?
0x55641cc: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0x5564238: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE) and
0x55642ac: attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0x556430c: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0x5564390: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0x55c9140: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0x55c91ac: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0x55c9200: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0x55c9280: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0x55c92d4: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0x5619888: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0x562d8e0: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0x562d918: Thank God...
0x562d938: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0x562d97c: She's got plenty of heart.
0x562d9a8: Thanks, Snake.
0x562d9c8: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0x5659890: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0x567008c: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0x568607c: Hmm. It looks like the infrared sensors that were set up here have been switched off.
0x5694878: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0x56a108c: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0x56a10c8: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x56b308c: A minefield, huh. You'll need a Mine Detector.
0x56b30cc: Meryl knows the base like the back of her hand. Why don't you ask her?
0x56c9894: A mine field, huh. Don't forget to use your mine detector.
0x56c98e0: When you find out where a mine is, crawl forward and try to recover it.
0x56e29b4: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0x56e2a08: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0x56e2aa0: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it...it's top secret information...
0x56e2b34: So you mean someone leaked the information?
0x56e2b70: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0x56e2bb0: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0x56e2c00: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on the base.
0x574d070: Snake, you'll have to go through the mine field to advance.
0x57570a4: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0x57570f4: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0x577489c: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0x5790884: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0x57a20ac: Snake, you've got to rescue Dr. Emmerich, the Metal Gear engineer.
0x57a2100: He's probably being held prisoner in the 2nd floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0x57bf070: Snake, don't fire your weapon on that floor.
0x57c9070: Snake, never use your weapon on that floor.
0x57d3998: I've already programmed the nanomachines so that he won't be able to, Colonel.
0x57d39f8: What! What are you talking about!?
0x57d3a2c: Have you forgotten? That's where they keep the nuclear warheads. Can't you see them?
0x57d3a94: Yeah. There's lots of boxes piled up here, but...are they all warheads?
0x57d3aec: Yes. They're all dismantled warheads.
0x57d3b24: They just leave them here? It's just like President Baker said...totally careless.
0x57d3b88: They're working on a limited budget. They try to put on a pretty face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.
0x57d3c14: Nastasha knows lots more about it than I do. 
0x5835078: Be careful. You absolutely must not use weapons in that area.
0x58420ac: All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation mechanisms removed so there's no fear of them exploding.
0x5842134: But if the warheads are broken, they might leak plutonium and that would be a serious problem.
0x58620bc: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0x58620f0: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your life gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0x5862168: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0x5888998: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0x58889fc: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0x5888a80: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0x5888b00: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0x5888ba0: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0x5888c28: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0x5888ca8: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0x5904068: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0x590a8a0: You've got to rescue Dr. Emmerich and find out Metal Gear's weak point.
0x590a8f8: Isn't he being held in the laboratory in the northeast part of the floor you're on?
0x59248b4: For the time being, let's trust what that Deepthroat told us.
0x5924904: Use a Remote Controlled Missile to destroy the switchboard in the NorthWest section of the Warhead Storage Building's 2nd floor basement. }
0x5948884: You did it. You destroyed the switchboard. The electrical current running through the floor should be off now.
0x595a878: Make sure your Remote Controlled Missile doesn't get shot down by that gun camera.
0x596809c: What's this pile of corpses...!? It looks like they were all slashed by some kind of sword.
0x5968108: It couldn't be!...
0x596812c: What!?
0x5968144: ...uh nothing.....
0x5982874: Snake, I'm worried about Emmerich. Hurry up and get to him!
0x598e084: Snake, be careful. You won't be able to control your missile in an area with electronic jamming.
0x599f8b4: The ninja!...
0x599f8d4: Huh?
0x599f8ec: What?
0x599f904: That stealth camouflage, it's him. It must be!
0x599f944: Snake! Emmerich's in danger! Hurry and go after him!
0x59bd870: Snake! Hurry! Emmerich's in danger!
0x59c7218: If you have a question about members of FOX-HOUND, you should ask Naomi.
0x59c7274: I'm sorry, but there's no one in FOX- HOUND like that.
0x59c72bc: There are currently only six members of FOX-HOUND.
0x59c7300: Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf, Vulcan Raven, Decoy Octopus, Revolver Ocelot...
0x59c735c: And finally Liquid Snake.
0x59c7388: The Genome soldiers under his command are Next Generation Special Forces.
0x59c73e4: FOX-HOUND is intended to be a small number of highly elite, hand-picked soldiers.
0x59c7448: You're talking about the current FOX- HOUND, right?
0x59c748c: Yes...
0x59c74a4: Snake, who or what is that thing? Is he an enemy or not?
0x59c74f0: That's what I'd like to know. Naomi, you really don't have any idea?
0x59c7548: ...Maybe I should ask you the same thing.
0x59c7584: What?
0x59c759c: Nothing...forget about it.
0x5a4f078: It looks like your weapons won't work on him. You'll have to think of something else.
0x5a5c080: He's fast! If you lose sight of him, switch to First Person View Mode and look for him.
0x5a6c87c: Snake, he's obviously trying to provoke you. Throw away your weapon and take him on.
0x5a7c06c: Snake, he's obviously trying to provoke you.
0x5a851f4: Well it looks like you've rescued Emmerich for the time being.
0x5a85244: Yeah. With that stealth camouflage, he should be able to hide safely.
0x5a8529c: Gray Fox...I can't believe it...But the real problem is your niece. The way the Codec got cut off like that has me worried.
0x5a85328: Something must have happened to her...
0x5a85360: You're worried? About Meryl?
0x5a85390: Not exactly. It's just that she's holding the detonation code override card keys. They're our last chance of stopping that nuclear launch.
0x5a8542c: You're a cold man. Your mission is more important than the life of your companions?
0x5a85490: This is war. Survival is the name of the game. Sometimes you have to be cold to survive.
0x5a854fc: Yes, but...
0x5a85518: Snake, either way I want you to find Meryl as soon as possible.
0x5a85568: I understand.
0x5b0c87c: Didn't Meryl say that she's somewhere close by? Why don't you start by searching in that building.
0x5b1b888: Meryl said that she's close by. She's probably in the Warhead Storage Building? Why don't you start by looking there.
0x5b2e8b0: So Meryl's disguised as an enemy soldier, huh? Well even so, you should be able to spot her if you look close enough.
0x5b2e938: Use either First Person View or Corner View Mode to get a really close look.
0x5b52878: You might also try to sneak in by covering yourself with that cardboard box.
0x5b5e8ac: Colonel, I saw your niece, but...
0x5b5e8e0: Really? Where?
0x5b5e900: She went in the ladies' bathroom.
0x5b5e934: That's strange. I saw her go in, but now she's nowhere to be found.
0x5b7d080: You'll just have to look in the stalls, I guess.
0x5b7d0c4: I guess you're right. I'll take em in order.
0x5b8c870: You didn't find Meryl? Why don't you take another look around?
0x5b971cc: Colonel, your niece is fine.
0x5b971fc: Thank goodness!
0x5b9721c: We can't relax...not yet.
0x5b97248: I know. Snake...
0x5b9726c: She is quite a woman.
0x5b97294: As commander of this operation, I can't ask you to watch after Meryl, but...
0x5b972f4: Duty first?
0x5b97310: Maybe I was wrong...sending my own flesh and blood to war.
0x5b9735c: She understands about duty.
0x5b97388: I know she does...
0x5b973ac: But what I want to know is what was the real purpose of this military exercise?
0x5b9740c: I don't know. Like I said, I'm nothing more than a middleman.
0x5b9745c: Is this transmission being monitored by the military?
0x5b974a4: Of course.
0x5b974c0: I get it. All the world's a stage and we're merely players, right?
0x5b97514: Yes, but even players can influence the play.
0x5b97554: I just hope we can prevent it from having a bad ending.
0x5c1c07c: Snake, go with Meryl to the underground base where they're keeping Metal Gear.
0x5c2a8e4: Colonel, Meryl's acting kind of strange.
0x5c2a920: Maybe she's just feeling a little tired from all the stress?
0x5c2a970: Snake, do you hear something that sounds like a song?
0x5c2a9b8: Yeah, I do. I started hearing it a little way back. What could it be?
0x5c54874: Hurry ahead, Snake. The underground base is to the north, isn't it?
0x5c608ac: Snake, Meryl's not herself. Don't use your weapon.
0x5c608f0: It's Psycho Mantis. He's controlling Meryl. That tune is his mind control music.
0x5c7b86c: Don't use your weapon. Try to knock her out.
0x5c848b0: I can't see Mantis!
0x5c848d4: Snake, he has mind powers, but he's not a magician. 
0x5c8491c: I get it. Stealth camouflage maybe?
0x5c84950: Meryl is being controlled by him.
0x5ca18a8: My First Person View Mode isn't working right.
0x5ca18e8: You're seeing what he's seeing. It's a result of his telepathic powers. Maybe you can use that to find him!
0x5cbc994: That's Psycho Mantis...former KGB psychic. He has powerful telepathic abilities.
0x5cbc9f8: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America looking for a job. He worked with the FBI on several cases as a psychic profiler.
0x5cbca98: But five years ago he was working on the case of a multiple serial murderer ...and he got too far into the killer's mind.
0x5cbcb24: As a result, he became just like the killer.
0x5cbcb64: So he was sort of infected by this serial murderer's thoughts?...
0x5cbcbb8: In any case, after that he became sort of a psychic spy working for the highest bidder. He travelled all around the world.
0x5cbcc44: That's when he was recruited by FOX-HOUND.
0x5d298e8: He can read people's minds. He knows every move that you're going to make. 
0x5d29944: What should I do? I've got no chance of beating him.
0x5d2998c: There must be some way.
0x5d299b4: He's a master at controlling people. Snake! Don't let him manipulate you!
0x5d520bc: Not everything you see with your two eyes is real. Destroying his spirit is more important than destroying his body.
0x5d52144: Don't let him read you. Be a blank slate! Okay? Clear your mind.
0x5d7507c: He read your mind with his psychic abilities. Somehow you've got to get around him!
0x5d840b8: He's using his psychic ability to read your Controller's moves. That's how he's evading your attack.
0x5d84130: You've got to do something so he can't read your Controller's moves. Think! There must be some way!
0x5da90a0: I've got it. Use the Controller port!!
0x5da90d8: Plug your Controller into Controller port 2. If you do that he won't be able to read your mind!
0x5dc6178: Snake, is there some reason you can't use Controller port 2?
0x5dc61c8: Oh well, it's okay. Do you see something that looks like a statue on both sides of the room?
0x5dc6238: Yeah. You mean those things with their faces all wrapped up in leather bands?
0x5dc6298: Yes. Attack those statues to uncover their faces.
0x5dc62dc: Why?
0x5dc62f4: Those statues were modeled after Mantis' real face.
0x5dc6338: Mantis despises the sight of his own face. If he suddenly sees his own disfigured face staring at him, it might break his concentration.
0x5e1c890: Snake, if you destroy the faces of those statues, you should be able to disturb Mantis' psychic powers.
0x5e32074: It looks like Meryl's okay. Thanks, Snake.
0x5e320b0: ..........
0x5e40898: Snake, there's no time left. You've got to hurry up and get to the underground base.
0x5e40900: You should be able to go north from the Commander's Room.
0x5e5907c: Snake, there's no time left. You've got to hurry up and get to the underground base.
0x5e69088: Snake, if you go up or down a ladder, just press the action button by the ladder.
0x5e7b090: To get to the underground base, you've got to go through that cave and use the passageway that leads to the Communications Tower.
0x5e9188c: Colonel, I lost track of Meryl.
0x5e918bc: If I know Meryl, she's provavly waiting for you up ahead somewhere.
0x5ea4084: Snake, isn't Meryl waiting for you?
0x5ea40b8: It's rude to keep a lady waiting.
0x5eb31f0: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0x5eb3234: Diazepam?
0x5eb3250: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0x5eb32f0: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0x5eb3330: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0x5eb33b0: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0x5eb3418: I see.
0x5eb3430: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0x5eb34b4: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0x5eb3534: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0x5f3f064: I am a scientist.
0x5f3fa9e: 4103!Q"$"
0x5f448a0: Be careful. Wolves have the advantage in the dark. Not only can they see better, but they have a keen sense of smell as well.
0x5f44930: You'd better use your Night-Vision Goggles.
0x5f62870: Ask Dr. Emmerich where the Night-Vision Goggles are.
0x5f6c0d8: Sniper Wolf is Fox Hound's best sharpshooter.
0x5f6c118: Everyone knows that women have more patience than men,
0x5f6c160: but Sniper Wolf can go for a whole week with no sleep, no food...her sights never straying from her target.
0x5f6c1dc: And on top of that, she takes diazepam, so that her hands never tremble.
0x5f9e08c: Snake, Meryl's in danger! Find a sniper rifle so you can shoot back at Wolf! It's the only way to save Meryl!
0x5fb3070: Snake!! What the hell!! Are you trying to kill Meryl!!?
0x5fbd064: Stop it! You'll kill her!
0x5fc2860: Snake, stop!!
0x5fc6868: You're terrible, Snake!!
0x5fcb88c: No!! I can't believe it!! Snake has gone insane!
0x5fcb8d0: Snake, you're a poor excuse for a man!...
0x5fde870: Stay out of her range and shoot at her with a sniper rifle. 
0x5fe88a0: Yeah, but where can I find a sniper rifle? I can't ask Meryl.
0x5fe88f0: What about Dr. Emmerich? He's been on the base for a while. He might know...
0x5fff86c: Ask Dr. Emmerich where there might be a sniper rifle.
0x6008890: Didn't you just hear that there's a sniper rifle in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar!? Go get it and save Meryl!
0x601f084: You got a PSG-1? You can use that against Sniper Wolf. Hurry up and save Meryl!
0x6030864: Have you gone insane!?
0x60358f8: Good job with Wolf. Is Meryl okay?
0x603592c: I don't know. I don't see her around.
0x6035964: You don't think she's been captured do you?!
0x60359a4: Could be. Let's ask Wolf. If she's still alive, I'm going to get some answers...
0x6035a08: Snake...
0x6035a24: About Meryl, I'm counting on you.
0x606b070: Snake, take the underground passage north.
0x6074874: Snake, don't worry. You'll have a chance to escape. Hang on.
0x6081888: The guard is only human. He has to sleep and go to the bathroom like the rest of us. That'll be your chance.
0x60950cc: Snake, that's a prison cell. You can't open the door from the inside. Somehow you'll have to get the key off the guard.
0x6095154: Yeah, but how?
0x6095174: Why don't you try disappearing?
0x60b70a4: The ketchup! You might be able to trick the guard if you use it right.
0x60b70fc: Snake, why don't you use the ketchup and pretend that you're dead?
0x60ce8a4: Great job with the guard, Snake. Now is your chance to escape.
0x60ce8f4: I plan on it. Next time I meet Ocelot, it's going to be on my terms...
0x60ea090: How do you feel, Snake? Can you go on?
0x60ea0c8: Yeah. Don't worry. That sadist can't keep me down.
0x60fe174: I don't know how, but the door is open.
0x60fe1ac: I saw the silhouette of someone in stealth cammies...
0x60fe1f4: Stealth camouflage? Could it be Emmerich?
0x60fe230: No, I don't think it was Otacon.
0x60fe264: So who then?.....You don't think it could be Gray Fox?
0x60fe2ac: Yeah, I do. I think it was...
0x60fe2dc: ...Are you saying that he came to save his friend?
0x60fe320: Could be. Or maybe he just doesn't want me to die in a prison cell.
0x60fe374: ...I don't know. I can't imagine what he could be thinking...
0x615c078: Snake, you can worry about it later. Now is the time to escape.
0x616886c: Snake. Now is your chance to escape/
0x617188c: Snake, wait a minute. You forgot to take your items.
0x61718d4: They're probably being kept somewhere close by.
0x6182890: Snake, be careful. They've set up new gun cameras and increased their patrols. They don't want you to get away.
0x6199898: You can either destroy them with a Grenade or jam them with your Chaff...
0x61998f4: You won't be able to get on the elevator unless you disable those gun cameras.
0x61b2868: First you've got to retrieve your items.
0x61b98a4: Snake, get that bomb out of your items!
0x61b98dc: Select the bomb in the Equipment Window and press the O button to throw it away!
0x61b9940: Hurry! Throw it away!
0x61d89cc: Snake, Naomi wants to talk to you.
0x61d8a00: How do you feel, Snake?
0x61d8a28: Well, to tell you the truth, I think I'm catching a cold...
0x61d8a74: I'm monitoring you via the nanomachines...Your body temperature is elevated and your lymph nodes are slightly swollen.
0x61d8afc: But don't worry, it appears to be just a mild rhinovirus.
0x61d8b48: I guess I got it from that soldier.
0x61d8b7c: I've increased your nutrition and elevated your blood sugar level.
0x61d8bd0: You can't cure it?
0x61d8bf4: Sorry, Snake. The nanomachines don't carry antibiotics.
0x61d8c3c: Maybe you could find some garlic. It contains natural antibiotics, you know. Vitamins and minerals too.
0x61d8cb4: Uhhh. Raw garlic. Gimme a break.
0x624c098: There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base. That would make you feel better.
0x624c104: If not, you'll just have to wait until your body's natural defenses take over.
0x6266090: To get to the underground base where Metal Gear is, you'll have to climb the Communications Tower on the north side of the cave.
0x627c078: Wait a minute, Snake. You're in an armory. Why don't you load up on ammo?
0x62890c4: Snake, the launch deadline for the new nuclear warhead is almost here. Hurry and get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base!
0x6289158: The overland route is blocked by a glacier. Climb the Communications Tower so you can go over it.
0x62b4104: The Communications Tower consists of tower A and tower B. You're in tower A now. To get to tower B, you'll have to use the outside walkway.
0x62b41a0: Remember, Snake. Dark places are dangerous places.
0x62b41e4: You can't see where your enemies are coming from. Please use your Night-Vision Goggles or your Thermal Goggles.
0x62ef86c: The walkway door won't open, huh?
0x62f7874: Snake, you'll have to use the walkway on the roof. Climb up there!
0x6303068: That's easy for you to say...
0x6304cef: =/^<.>/1
0x630a070: Use your throw move on the bad guys that are chasing you!
0x631489c: Grenades might work well too. To get the grenade to explode near the soldiers, pull the pin and hold on to it for 4 seconds before you throw it.
0x632f87c: Yeah. Any ideas?
0x632f8a0: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich.
0x633c0c4: Wait a minute, Snake. According to these satellite photos that Mei Ling got, it looks as if there's a walkway on the roof as well.
0x633c158: You can take that to the other side too.
0x633c194: Be careful, Snake.
0x635c8f8: Whew...I made it to the roof.
0x635c928: You must be exhausted, Snake.
0x635c958: It was no big deal.
0x635c97c: Snake, I'm monitoring you closely. Your heart rate is elevated and your breathing is shallow.
0x635c9ec: ..........
0x635ca08: What's the matter, Snake? You out of shape from all that dog mushing?
0x638f07c: The walkway should be right in front of you. Cross it to get to tower B.
0x639d06c: Then climb down and proceed north.
0x63a507c: Where are you going, Snake? Hurry and take the walkway on the roof to the B tower.
0x63b3884: If the Remote Controlled Missile goes too far away, you'll lose control over it. Be careful.
0x63c5084: The walkway on the roof of tower A was destroyed...? That doesn't mean there's no other way.
0x63d88a0: Is there a rope or something around there? If you had a rope you could rappel from the roof of tower A down to the walkway below.
0x63d8934: You're an expert at rappelling aren't you?
0x63f5088: You'll have to go to the north part of tower A and use that rope to rappel down to the walkway below.
0x6407904: It's too dangerous! That Hind is aiming at Snake! And he'll need to use both hands to rappel too!
0x6407978: You're right, but we have no choice! The Hind can't move in tight spaces. It's our best bet!
0x64079e8: This is insane!
0x6407a08: The colonel's right. There's no other way.
0x643a160: Here's how to rappel.
0x643a188: Press the X button to jump away from the wall. While you're away from the wall, press down on the Directional Button to drop down. 
0x643a21c: If you jump while pressing right or left on the Directional Button, you can make a big jump in that direction.
0x643a29c: If you press and hold the O Button while using the Directional Button, you can walk slowly across the wall.
0x643a318: If you're careful with the timing, you should be able to dodge the gunfire from the Hind while you rappel down. If anyone can do it, you can Snake!
0x64a2064: I made it to the bottom.
0x64a7070: Thank God you're okay. I was terrified just watching you.
0x64b1864: You're incredible, Snake.
0x64b7078: Snake, why don't you try the door that leads from the walkway to Tower A?
0x64c407c: Snake, you're under attack from off-screen.
0x64c40b8: What should I do?
0x64cf8ac: First find out where the enemy is. Use your binoculars.
0x64cf8f4: Then attack with a PSG-1 or Remote Controlled Missile. Something with a longer range than an ordinary weapon.
0x64f009c: Snake, the Hind is still circling above the Communications Tower.
0x64f00f0: Damn. There's no weapon here that I can use to take him on.
0x650587c: Dr. Emmerich might know where there's a weapon you could use against the Hind. Why don't you ask him.
0x6506e6b: >?$333C"
0x6514890: Snake, hurry up and get those Stinger Missiles. Didn't Emmerich say they're near the entrance to the walkway in tower B?
0x652a08c: The way to the top is blocked, huh...Well we can worry about that later. Why don't you go and see what's happening below?
0x653f06c: Press the Action button to drop down.
0x6548098: The staircase is broken...tough luck. It looks like the elevator is the only way up now. Okay, Snake, I want you to head up there right away.
0x6562948: It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you. I'm looking at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.
0x65629e0: Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just circling around like a buzzard.
0x6562a38: I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast?
0x6562a78: Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do something to help.
0x6562abc: Snake...I don't like it. Please don't go up to the roof.
0x6562b08: I have to. I can't run from this one.
0x65ab86c: Liquid is waiting for you up on the roof...
0x65b3894: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x65b38f4: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x65cc8c4: Liquid means to bring this to an end now. He obviously planned this.
0x65cc91c: Maybe the broken elevator was all part of the trap.
0x65cc960: You mean he fiddled with the elevator to get me out on the roof?
0x65ed870: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0x65f5890: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0x660c084: Use your ears, Snake. You should be able to tell where he's coming from by the sound of his rotor blades.
0x661d92c: Huh? Snake, you're not using a stereo TV?
0x661d968: It can't be!
0x661d988: A mono TV...
0x661d9c0: Well Colonel...there's nothing we can do about it...
0x661da08: I guess you're right.
0x661da30: Snake, don't worry about it. There's more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. You can do it just the way you are!
0x66648f8: You did it, Snake! You shot down the Hind! 
0x6664934: I was so worried...
0x6664958: Liquid couldn't have survived that.
0x666498c: I wonder...
0x66649a8: But even so, just cause we've taken out their leader doesn't mean they're going to give up. They're still going to try to launch that nuke.
0x6664a44: You're right. There's no time to waste.
0x6697088: Hurry. The underground base is past the Communications Tower. The elevator is working again, isn't it?
0x669973a: DER34.#U
0x66a90c0: They're using stealth camouflage! You can't see them, so listen closely. Use your ears.
0x66a9128: How does that stealth technology work?
0x66a9160: Is it optic or chemical?...Do you know, Snake?
0x66c9078: Snake, you can't fight what you can't see. Use your Thermal Goggles!
0x66d6880: Snake, use all five of your senses. You can do it even without Thermal Goggles!
0x66e686c: Ask the person who invented it. He should know.
0x66ef974: It looks like the weather is getting worse. Try using your Binoculars.
0x66ef9cc: What about the satellite data?
0x66ef9fc: I'm sorry, Snake. I can't see the entrance in the satellite photos either.
0x66efa58: What about a heat source? An exhaust pipe or something?
0x66efaa0: I can't confirm anything. Only that there are multiple heat sources to the southeast of your position.
0x66efb18: That's probably just the burning wreckage from the Hind.
0x66efb64: Snake, you're in a big open space surrounded by walls. The entrance to the underground base should be somewhere in there.
0x66efbf0: Stay close to the walls and you won't get lost.
0x674a078: Snake, you're our only hope. Please stop them from launching that nuke.
0x6758888: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is somewhere towards the back of the Snowfield north of Tower B.
0x676b078: Colonel, listen to me. I found a parachute near the wreckage of the Hind.
0x677816c: A parachute? You don't think that Liquid survived....?
0x67781b4: Impossible. As soon as he jumped out of the pilot's seat, he'd be sliced up faster than an onion on an infomercial.
0x6778238: ...So what's that parachute doing there then?
0x6778278: I have no idea.
0x6778298: A trap?
0x67782b0: Either that or a message...to me.
0x67782e4: ...Meaning I'm not dead , I suppose...
0x6778320: Maybe...but I think it's more like I'll string you up! .
0x677836c: ..........
0x6778388: Well, in any case, don't let your guard down.
0x67783c8: I won't.
0x67d50d8: Snake, look at your C-rations. They're frozen. You can't use frozen C-rats.
0x67d5134: Until they defrost, you won't be able to replenish your energy. Be very careful.
0x67d5198: They'll defrost in a warm place. Probably just your bare skin would be fine.
0x6801074: It's Sniper Wolf. You can only shoot at her with your PSG-1.
0x680d880: Snake, Wolf is hiding somewhere in that Snowfield. First you'll have to find out where she is.
0x681f06c: She should come out of hiding briefly to shoot at you.
0x682807c: It looks like Wolf is down. Now get to Metal Gear's underground base on the double.
0x6837150: We shouldn't have turned our backs on the Kurds after the Gulf War...
0x68371a8: Listen. We're not responsible for her choices. Everyone decides their own fate, no matter where they were born.
0x6837228: Words like fate, karma...it's just an excuse for giving up if you ask me....
0x6837288: I don't agree with you.
0x68372b0: Maybe if she hadn't been born on a battlefield, she might have had a happier, more fulfilling life. She might not have turned into a killer...
0x6837350: ..........
0x688988c: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base! The entrance should be towards the back of the Snowfield.
0x689d88c: Use the elevator to change floors. 
0x689d8c0: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there.
0x689d920: Try to find it.
0x68b3070: Snake, we're not paying you to be a scarecrow y'know.
0x68bd074: Poor things. Ravens are God's creatures too, Snake.
0x68c8884: Snake, we don't need a rat trap. We need someone to stop that godamn nuke from getting launched!
0x68db08c: Snake, is killing rats really that fun? Torturing small animals is a sign of a warped mind, you know.
0x68ef860: What can I do for you, Snake?
0x68f4060: What is it, Snake?
0x68f7860: You called, Snake?
0x68fb860: What's up, Snake?
0x68ff060: Snake, are you okay?
0x6903860: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x6908064: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x690d860: Snake...
0x6911064: How can I help, Snake?
0x6903860: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x6908064: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x690d860: Snake...
0x6911064: How can I help, Snake?
0x691606c: Snake, just tell me. I'll do anything to help.
0x691f068: Snake, how are you holding up?
0x6926060: Did you call, Snake?
0x692a860: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x692f060: Good luck, Snake.
0x6933060: Be careful, Snake.
0x6937070: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x6940864: Don't give up, Snake!
0x6945868: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x694c064: Win Snake! Win!
0x6951864: Don't die, Snake!
0x6957064: Do it for me Snake!
0x695c868: Please Snake, don't give up.
0x6963068: Come back alive, Snake...
0x696a068: Snake, it's all up to you...
0x6970860: Don't give up!
0x697485c: Don't die...
0x6977864: Be careful, Snake.
0x697c874: Sorry. The Soliton radar won't work in a narrow space.
0x69888a4: Too much harmonic resonance. The radio waves produce interference and we can't analyze the topographic data.
0x6988924: Try to hang on until you get to a more open space. Okay?
0x69a7894: You found out where the DARPA Chief is! With his nanomachine transmitter, he should show up as a green dot on your radar when you get close.
0x69a7934: Try to find him.
0x69c1084: Look at the radar! It's picking up the DARPA chief. He's the green dot. Hurry and rescue him.
0x69d389c: Snake, you can't use your radar in that area. There's some kind of electronic jamming coming from there...I wonder what it is. Anyway, be careful.
0x69f087c: The DARPA Chief. Poor man...he has a heart attack right after you save him...
0x6a01878: I'm getting a bad feeling about this, Snake. Maybe you should let me save your mission.
0x6a0f940: Mei Ling, how can someone outside of this operation cut into my Codec?
0x6a0f998: You're talking about that guy calling himself Deepthroat. We were monitoring from here.
0x6a0fa00: What about it?
0x6a0fa20: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it...it's top secret information...
0x6a0fab4: Can you tell where he called from?
0x6a0fae8: I'm sorry. The signal is too weak to locate its source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on the base.
0x6a61088: Snake, you can't use the radar because something's jamming it.
0x6a610d8: And whatever's doing it is very close to you. Be careful!
0x6a75894: Snake, you can't use your radar. It's confused by all of the radio interference. That ninja is giving off some kind of electrical energy!
0x6a8d998: Snake, there's an old Chinese saying: A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar. 
0x6a8da24: Einstein said it another way. He said that only a life lived for others is worth living.
0x6a8da90: That's why I entered MIT instead of Princeton or Vassar like my friends.
0x6a8daec: I wanted to do applied physics, not just theoretical stuff. I wanted to make things for people.
0x6a8db5c: The Soliton Radar System or the Codec System...I just wanted to make something that would be useful for people.
0x6a8dbdc: I think that it was the same for Dr. Emmerich too.
0x6a8dc20: But he was used like a tool...used to make a horrible killing machine.
0x6a8dc78: Maybe it would be better if engineers like us just stopped making things... I don't know.
0x6b0f0b8: No, you're wrong. There's at least one person whose life has gotten better as a result of your inventions. Me.
0x6b0f138: Huh?
0x6b0f150: Without the Codec, I wouldn't be able to talk to you like this.
0x6b0f1a0: ...Thanks, Snake.
0x6b1217f: /?2BaQ4$
0x6b340e8: Snake! That's a ladies bathroom!
0x6b3411c: I know that. I saw Meryl come in here.
0x6b34154: So you went in after her!? Are you some kind of pervert!? I won't let you save your mission now!
0x6b341c8: Listen Mei Ling, this is the only place on this base that I can talk to Meryl alone!
0x6b34230: Whatever, weirdo! Don't call me again!
0x6b65058: ..........
0x6b6f8b4: It's a good thing you hooked up with Meryl...
0x6b6f8f4: You should have seen the Colonel. He doesn't like to let it show cause he's the boss, but he was so happy he could barely contain himself.
0x6b6f990: I'm glad to hear that.
0x6b8f0b8: Snake, your Soliton radar...
0x6b8f0e8: I know. I can't use it in a narrow space like this, right?
0x6b8f134: Right. I'm sorry.
0x6b8f158: No reason to apologize. Even the greatest masterpiece has its flaws.
0x6bb0144: She'll die if you leave her like that! Aren't you going to save her!?
0x6bb019c: She's just bait...it's me they want. If I step out there, I'm going to get picked off and who's going to save Meryl then!?
0x6bb0228: I'm hoping that as long as I don't fall for it, they'll leave Meryl alive.
0x6bb0284: So you're just going to leave Meryl there? She's hurt!
0x6bb02cc: I know what I'm doing. Meryl understands too.
0x6bb030c: That's horrible...
0x6bb0330: You're right. It is horrible. But that's war. And the first rule of war is to stay alive.
0x6bff86c: Snake, wouldn't now be a good time to save your mission?
0x6c08870: You haven't saved your mission in a long time anyway, right?
0x6c120b0: What's going on?
0x6c120d4: I'm not sure...I'm getting a bad feeling.
0x6c12110: A bad feeling? Something you ate?
0x6c12144: No, I'm serious...like a premonition or something...
0x6c318f0: Snake, are you okay? I feel so scared for you. It must be horrible.
0x6c31944: I've been through a lot worse. Believe me.
0x6c31980: Wow. You really are a hero.
0x6c319ac: It's a good thing the Codec is connected directly to your inner ear. You can contact us anytime.
0x6c31a20: ...It's always nice to hear that you're all right.
0x6c68874: Why don't you contact the Colonel? If anyone can think of a way out, it's him.
0x6c741bc: Mei Ling...You must think I'm garbage...
0x6c741f8: ...Snake, don't blame yourself too much.
0x6c74234: You just...
0x6c74250: I just let them kill Meryl to save my own worthless hide!
0x6c7429c: Listen...in China, they have a saying...
0x6c742d8: ..........
0x6c742f4: Forget it...I'll use my own words this time.
0x6c74334: Cheer up, Snake.
0x6c74358: Don't listen to what he said. It's nothing but a bluff. I'm sure about that.
0x6c743b8: I don't think he's the bluffing type...
0x6c743f0: But, Snake. You have a job to do. Pull yourself together for the world's sake.
0x6c74450: First, you've got to figure out how to get out of there.
0x6c744b8: Snake, listen to me!
0x6c744e0: You...you've got to pull yourself together, and get back to work.
0x6c74534: You're right. I've sat here feeling sorry for myself long enough.
0x6c74588: Thanks, Mei Ling...
0x6d19998: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said: The graveyards are full of indispensable men. 
0x6d19a00: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0x6d19a88: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0x6d19adc: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0x6d19b44: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0x6d19bd8: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0x6d19c40: Well...I'll think about it.
0x6d8a0cc: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said: He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough. 
0x6d8a140: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x6d8a198: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x6db98dc: Snake, like Shakespeare said: Nought's had, all's spent, Where our desire is got without content. 
0x6db9954: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x6db99bc: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x6dc3d0f: > !
0x6def8c8: Snake, in China they say You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath. . Do you know what that means?
0x6def960: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x6e1c0dc: Snake, have you ever heard the saying Friendly counsel cuts off many foes. ?
0x6e1c13c: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x6e1c1b8: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x6e518d0: In my parents' homeland they say If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten. 
0x6e51968: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x6e838bc: Snake, like Confucius said: The cautious seldom err. 
0x6e83908: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x6eac8bc: In China, they say: Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many. 
0x6eac918: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x6ed60d0: The Chinese say It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns. .
0x6ed6128: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x6ed61a4: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x6f0609c: There's a Chinese proverb: The mind cannot be in two places at once. 
0x6f060f8: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x6f218dd: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still aflying, And this same flower, that smiles today, Tomorrow will be dying. 
0x6f21970: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x6f219a8: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x6f580bc: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote: Solitude sometimes is best society, And short retirement urges sweet return. 
0x6f58140: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your short retirement in Alaska, huh.
0x6f818c1: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts. 
0x6f81944: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x6fab0c8: In China, they say: Once the fox gets his nose in, He'll soon find a way to make his body follow. 
0x6fab140: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x6fd68b9: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself. 
0x6fd6900: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x6fd6974: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x6ffe0c0: Snake, in China they say: When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals. .
0x6ffe130: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x6ffe19c: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x70278dc: In China, they say: The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly. .
0x7027934: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x70279c0: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... Believe in yourself!
0x705e8b8: Snake, Leo Durocher said Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last. 
0x705e914: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x705e98c: You should think about that, Snake.
0x70860bc: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x7086105: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd Give me my armor. 
0x708615c: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x70ad899: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; Honor but an empty bubble. 
0x70ad8ec: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x70c78ac: Snake, Come, what come may,Time and the hour runs through the roughest day .
0x70c790c: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x70c7940: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x70e98bd: "O, it is excellent To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant. 
0x70e9930: It's not right to use force to get someone to do what they don't want to do.
0x70e9990: That goes for countries too, don't you think?
0x71108b5: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy. 
0x7110918: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0x71358b9: "This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise. 
0x7135910: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0x715d8bd: "The tongues of dying men Enforce attention, like deep harmony. 
0x715d910: Snake, people don't normally lie with their dying breaths. I think he was telling the truth. Maybe you should believe him.
0x71858dc: In China they say It's better to live ugly than to die beautiful .
0x7185934: I think it's true. Once you're dead, you'll never have another chance to be happy. I can't understand people who want to die before their time.
0x71859d4: Please Snake...promise me that you'll come back alive.
0x71b98e5: "Where life is more terrible than death, it is then the truest valor to dare to live. 
0x71b9950: Snake, sometimes living is harder than dying. That's when you really have to be courageous.
0x71b99bc: It must be terrible for you now. Please...please be brave. I know you'll make it. I believe in you.
0x71f2944: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0x71f2998: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0x71f2a1c: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0x71f2a88: You're watching everything?
0x71f2ab4: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0x71f2b10: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0x71f2b5c: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0x72440f8: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0x7244154: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x72441a8: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0x72441f8: But you have no choice, Snake.
0x7244228: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep putting things in my pocket.
0x727b908: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0x727b94c: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0x727b991: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions. 
0x727b9ec: What's that supposed to mean?
0x727ba1c: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0x727ba98: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0x72b99e8: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x72b9a20: Why do you ask?
0x72b9a40: I like to play fighting games.
0x72b9a70: Games?
0x72b9a88: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x72b9b30: Not a very good job, huh.
0x72b9b5c: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x72b9bc4: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x72b9c14: I'm sorry...
0x72b9c34: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x72b9c94: Okay, Snake...I understand. War's not a game.
0x72b9cd4: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x72b9d48: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0x73499a0: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x73499e4: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x7349a30: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x7349a78: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x7349ac0: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x7349b54: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x7349bb4: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x7349c28: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x7349c64: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0x73bc1e0: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x73bc248: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x73bc2b0: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x73bc2e8: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x73bc344: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x73bc3a4: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x73bc434: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x73bc474: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x73bc4ec: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x73bc530: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x73bc598: You can say that again.
0x7447214: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0x7447254: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0x74472b8: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0x7447330: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0x744738c: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0x7447408: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0x7447448: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0x74474ac: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0x7447508: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0x7447550: I don't know about that...
0x744757c: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0x74475ec: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0x7447628: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0x744767c: And how do I do that?
0x74476a4: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0x74ea8ad: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... 
0x74ea8f0: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x74ea93c: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x75100c4: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0x75100fc: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Hunter said?
0x751015d: "He that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0x753e0b9: "Wise men ne'er sit and bewail their loss, but cheerly seek how to redress their harms. 
0x753e124: Snake, if you're lost and you don't know what to do, you should call Colonel Campbell. He might have a good suggestion for you.
0x7563898: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x75638f0: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x757d088: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x758f884: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x75a1878: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x75ad900: Get on your stomach. Fire from the prone position. It would be good if you had a tri pod or something stable to balance your weapon on.
0x75ad998: If you don't have that, hold the weapon firmly under your armpit and keep it still with your chin. Line up your target in your scope's crosshairs.
0x75e7898: Most soldiers can hit a target at 300 meters. I have a friend who can hit one at 520 meters.
0x75ff0dc: To be a good sniper, you must have nerves of steel and lots of patience. Sometimes you have to sit in position for days, barely moving a muscle.
0x75ff180: The most important thing is to wait for your opportunity and then take it.
0x76328c0: A slight tremor in your hand can cause you to miss a target 60 meters away by a half foot or more.
0x7632934: Concentrate, hold your breath and try to stop your hand from moving.
0x765c134: The most important thing is to zero your rifle scope.
0x765c17c: If you do not zero your sight correctly, you will never be able to hit your target.
0x765c1e0: Your sight might be slightly off, so it would be a good idea to try a test shot. If it is off, you will have to take some lead for that when you shoot.
0x765c288: Don't worry. This was Sniper Wolf's rifle.
0x765c2c4: Oh. In that case, you had better not mess with it.
0x76aa8f0: At a distance of 400 meters, a one degree difference in air temperature will take you about 1 centimeter off your target.
0x76aa97c: Atmospheric pressure will affect your shot in the same way. That is why you have to aim differently depending on the conditions.
0x76e30dc: Have you ever heard of the Magnus Effect? Normally, a rifle bullet rotates and curves slightly to the right. That is called the Magnus Effect.
0x76e317c: Think about comrade Magnus when you are lining up your crosshairs.
0x7717a30: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x7717aac: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x7717b44: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x7717bc8: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x7717c30: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x7717c98: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x7717d18: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x7717d9c: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x7717dec: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x77b7908: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x77b7954: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x77b79cc: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x77b7a54: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x77fd0cc: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x77fd138: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x77fd184: We just don't have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x782a958: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x782a9dc: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x782aa58: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x782aad8: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapons disposal facilities.
0x788da3c: They were conducting exercises with this new Metal Gear prototype. Is that what the DARPA Chief said?
0x788dab4: Yeah.
0x788dacc: What the hell...!?
0x788daf0: So you know about Metal Gear?
0x788db20: Just rumors. I heard it is some kind of walking tank that can deliver an accurate nuclear strike from any terrain...mountains, deserts, swamps...
0x788dbc4: ...wherever. But you are the real expert on Metal Gear, aren't you Snake?
0x788dc20: Yeah, I guess I am. But what about the PAL system that the DARPA Chief mentioned?
0x788dc84: It is a device attached to a nuclear weapon system to prevent the missile from being armed or launched.
0x788dcfc: Usually a secret detonation code or combination is necessary to launch the missile.
0x788dd60: According to the chief, there are two codes and the terrorists already know one of them.
0x788ddcc: The other code...if the terrorists find out that one too...
0x788de18: Yeah... I've got to hurry and rescue President Baker...
0x79408e8: PAL stands for permissive action link. It's a safety system attached to nuclear missile systems.
0x7940960: The missile cannot be fired without the insertion of a special electronic code.
0x79409c0: But if the terrorists have found out the detonation codes, they can launch the missile anytime they want.
0x797a178: Is it possible to destroy the PAL system so that the missile can be fired even without inserting the detonation code?
0x797a200: I do not believe so.
0x797a228: It is set up so that the warhead will become automatically inactive if any attempt is made to remove, deactivate or destroy the PAL.
0x797a2c0: So unless the terrorists either learn the detonation codes or get their hands on the detonation code override keys,
0x797a344: ...there's no way they can launch...
0x797a37c: Do not be too sure. Any system can contain bugs or malfunctions. We cannot relax yet.
0x79db150: I do not know much about Metal Gear. Just the little I have heard.
0x79db1a4: I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in 1995 and then again in Zanzibar in 1999...
0x79db208: Both were Third World countries led by military regimes.
0x79db254: They secretly developed Metal Gear to increase their military and political power throughout the world.
0x79db2cc: But both were stopped by a lone hero...you, Solid Snake.
0x79db318: ..........
0x79db334: That was a long time ago....
0x7a331a4: All the ICBM silos are closely monitored by military satellites.
0x7a331f8: SLBM-equipped submarines can move secretly, but naturally they are limited to launching from the water.
0x7a33270: Finally, there are ALBMs which can be launched from aircraft. They allow for excellent mobility, but they are somewhat unreliable...
0x7a33308: Metal Gear was developed to solve all those problems.
0x7a33350: It can move freely over any terrain and independently launch a nuclear missile at any target in the world.
0x7a333cc: It completely changes the nature of the strategic arms race and destroys the delicate nuclear balance...It's a weapon to be feared, believe me.
0x7ab5174: The development of Metal Gear is a cynical attempt to consolidate and increase our military dominance...
0x7ab51f0: ...while at the same time maintaining the pretense of disarming ourselves.
0x7ab524c: Now that the SLCM zero option, allowing for the sneak inspections of submarines in international waters, has been concluded,
0x7ab52dc: ...the value of submarines as strategic weapons has been greatly diminished.
0x7ab533c: With Metal Gear, governments of the world will be able to avoid this type of inspection,
0x7ab53a8: ...and at the same time stay in compliance with international nuclear treaties.
0x7b23118: It is just like Baker said. We are facing increasing danger from stored nuclear materials.
0x7b23184: You see, there are three elements necessary in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
0x7b231e8: Nuclear materials, nuclear engineers, and manufacturing technology.
0x7b2323c: All three of them can easily be acquired by either legal or illegal means. If you have enough money, that is.
0x7b6e118: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x7b6e168: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x7b6e1d4: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x7b6e238: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.
0x7bb88e4: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x7bb8970: That stands for Material Unaccounted For .
0x7bb89b0: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.
0x7bef104: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x7bef168: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x7bef204: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...
0x7c31970: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x7c31a00: They are big on the nuclear deterrent theory.
0x7c31a44: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x7c31adc: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...
0x7c31b64: ...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike. Those two probably feel that Metal Gear will further promote that security...
0x7c9e11c: The right-wingers believe that as long as any country has nuclear weapons, they must have them as well.
0x7c9e194: That is why they will never be in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x7c9e1fc: And with each new country that acquires nuclear capabilities, the need for maintaining that counterstrike threat increases.
0x7c9e288: As long as the nuclear deterrent policy continues, we'll never be rid of nuclear weapons...
0x7cea280: The theory of nuclear deterrence was born during the Cold War, at a time of great suspicion between the US and the USSR.
0x7cea30c: The great gulf between the ideologies of East and West caused a dramatic escalation in the arms race.
0x7cea384: And this escalation of the arms race in turn fueled mutual distrust and fear between the world's two great superpowers.
0x7cea40c: The last half of the 20th century was shaped by the policy of nuclear deterrence.
0x7cea470: But the world has changed.
0x7cea49c: The Cold War has ended and we are now living in a world where small, regional conflicts are breaking out all over.
0x7cea520: Things are not so simple anymore, and the policy of nuclear deterrence is obsolete.
0x7cea584: Most of these regional conflicts are the result of age old enmities between different ethnic groups and religions.
0x7cea608: In those cases, the hatred often runs so deep that rationality is thrown out the window.
0x7cea674: For people such as them, the fear of a counterstrike often means little and that is why the nuclear deterrence policy has lost much of its efficacy.
0x7cea71c: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.
0x7dc512c: Snake, that is a nuclear warhead storage area.
0x7dc516c: Are all these filled with nuclear warheads?
0x7dc51a8: Yes. But their detonation mechanisms have been removed.
0x7dc51f0: So I don't have to worry about this island turning into a pile of smoking rubble?
0x7dc5254: No. But if the casing is damaged, they may be leaking nuclear materials. Please make sure you do not use your gun around there.
0x7e089ac: Naturally, nuclear weapons contain plutonium.
0x7e089ec: Most of the radiation emitted by plutonium isotopes consists of alpha rays.
0x7e08a48: The ionization effects are strong, but if they are kept in containers there is no danger of exposure.
0x7e08ac0: But if plutonium enters the body through breathing or other contact, it is quickly absorbed into the bones and internal organs.
0x7e08b50: After that, there is no way to remove it.
0x7e08b8c: Once that happens, the victim will be constantly exposed to it, and just one one-millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer.
0x7e08c20: That is why a plutonium leak is such a serious danger. Make sure you do not use your gun anywhere near there.
0x7e8c964: Scientists are currently using gene therapy to try to create a microorganism capable of breaking down plutonium,
0x7e8c9e8: they have not yet had any success.
0x7e8ca1c: The plutonium version of bio-remediation, huh.
0x7e8ca5c: Instead of processing, what about reusing it? I thought that they were working on using dismantled plutonium for civilian applications.
0x7e8caf4: For a time, it looked like there was going to be international cooperation for that,
0x7e8cb5c: ...but unfortunately there was too much mutual suspicion, and it all fell apart.
0x7ee70fc: The signing of START was a step in the right direction, but it created a flood of dismantled plutonium.
0x7ee7174: Disposing of that plutonium safely is now the biggest challenge facing the world.
0x7ee71d8: Combustion in nuclear reactors, vitrification processing...lots of suggestions have been made,
0x7ee7248: no effective solutions have been found.
0x7f25998: Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation...
0x7f25a18: ...without ever exploding a nuclear device. Is that true?
0x7f25a64: Yes, it's true. Since the establishment of DARHT, the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility,
0x7f25ae0: ...and NIF, the National Ignition Facility early in the 21st century, there's been a wealth of data concerning nuclear fission and fusion.
0x7f25b7c: There is also much of data accumulated from the nuclear tests conducted over the last four decades.
0x7f25bf4: With the processing speed of today's supercomputers, they can design a new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer simulations.
0x7f909c8: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they're doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x7f90a40: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x7f90ad8: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x7f90b30: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x7f90bd4: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x7f90c7c: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x7f90ce0: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.
0x801d9d8: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x801da4c: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x801dad4: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x801db58: ...but that's nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x801dba0: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x801dc08: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear and other plasma weapons.
0x801dc98: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.
0x80b2a1c: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?
0x80b2a7c: That was the secret World War II project responsible for the creation of the first atomic bomb.
0x80b2aec: It had a huge budget, something like two billion dollars. They brought in 120,000 of the best and brightest scientists and engineers to work on it.
0x80b2b90: And we all know how that story ended.
0x80b2bc8: In July of 1945, they exploded the first nuclear device at Trinity, followed shortly after by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x80b2c50: Trinity...the world was changed forever that day. Scientists and researchers could no longer pretend that their hands were clean of blood.
0x80b2cec: Afterwards, the leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, said:
0x80b2d4d: "The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose. .
0x81641e0: When Dr. Emmerich designed the new Metal Gear prototype, he thought he was creating a mobile TMD system. He is a very naive man.
0x8164274: TMD stands for Theater Missile Defense .
0x81642b0: They represent a shift in defense priorities from dealing with the threat of ICBMs from the former Soviet Union,
0x8164334: ...to dealing with small scale regional conflicts in the Third World.
0x816438c: Current TMD systems work by a combination of THAADs, theater high altitude air defense, which intercept missiles outside of the atmosphere,
0x8164428: and Patriot-type missiles which intercept missiles within the atmosphere.
0x8164484: Dr. Emmerich was planning on them using Metal Gear as a low atmosphere mobile missile interceptor unit.
0x81fe18c: There are many in Russia as well as America 
0x81fe1cc: ...because they say that it undermines the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
0x81fe240: And there are also those who say that the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over from the Cold War.
0x81fe2b4: They argue that the strategy of MAD (mutually assured destruction) should be maintained by limiting missile defense systems.
0x81fe344: There was a big debate over it, but ultimately, under pressure from the Defense Industry who was looking to expand into new markets,
0x81fe3dc: TMD systems were accepted as an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x827719c: So the terrorist's intentionally set their deadline to coincide with the signing of the START 3 Accord...
0x8277218: According to the terms of START 3,both Russia and the U.S. are to reduce the number 
0x8277280: of their nuclear warheads in deployment to between 2,000 and 2,500 missiles.
0x82772e0: The current President has not yet had any major foreign policy successes.
0x827733c: His term will be up soon and the word at the White House is that he desperately wants this one for the history books.
0x82773c4: Typical politician...
0x82773ec: It's a big concern for him and his supporters.
0x82e1a48: The signing of the START 3 was dependent on ratification of the START 2.
0x82e1aa4: But MIRVs were the most important weapon in Russian arsenal.
0x82e1af4: Naturally, the conservatives in the Russian Parliament were greatly opposed to disarming them.
0x82e1b64: The expansion of NATO, along with tension caused by disagreements
0x82e1bb8: ...the application of the ABM Treaty with regards to TMD systems made ratification in the 1990's difficult.
0x82e1c34: It took a tremendous amount of pressure and secret negotiations to get the Russians to sign the START 3 tomorrow.
0x82e1cb8: But the political situation in Russia is tenuous at best and one small incident could bring the signing to a crashing halt.
0x82e1d44: If the Russians learn that America has secretly developed a new type of nuclear weapon, there is no telling how they might react.
0x82e1dd8: World opinion will be strongly against us too.
0x82e1e18: That Liquid Snake is a smart one...he knows the political climate. His actions were obviously very well calculated...
0x83a2114: It's true that the signing of START 3 would mean a reduction in nuclear missiles,
0x83a2178: but it would still leave between 4,000 to 5,000 missiles between the US and Russia alone.
0x83a21e4: That is more than enough to destroy every living thing on this planet several times over.
0x83a2250: There's a big difference between nuclear reduction and nuclear elimination.
0x83eb154: Negotiations for START 3 began in the late 1990's.
0x83eb198: The Russian President had actually been pushing for a much more ambitious arms reduction pact, but it was rejected by the Americans.
0x83eb230: America was the sole remaining superpower on the Earth and they were not too eager to give up the title.
0x83eb2ac: The fact is in the history of the world, no dominant power has ever willingly given up the reigns of that power.
0x83eb330: ...in the case of the US, that means nuclear superiority.
0x844d0dc: There has been a lot of effort to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons,...
0x844d144: but even today, there is no treaty limiting tactical nuclear weapons.
0x844d19c: It may look from the outside that the world is disarming, but in fact nuclear weapons are not going anywhere soon.
0x848089c: The Nuclear Age is not over yet. As long as one country in the world has nuclear weapons, they will never go away.
0x849b98c: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x849b9ec: it's going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x849ba80: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a core deterrent force of less than 500 missiles each,
0x849bb18: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x849bbb8: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.
0x8513258: There is no doubt about it. After the Cold War ended, the chance of a full-scale world-wide nuclear conflagration was diminished.
0x85132ec: But on the other hand, the chances of local, tactical use of nuclear weapons greatly increased.
0x851335c: Civil wars, revolutions, regional disputes...it seems like there is a new war popping up somewhere every day,
0x85133dc: and many of them are the result of centuries-old hatred between different ethnic or religious groups.
0x8513454: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x8513498: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.
0x8513520: A nuclear deterrent is meaningless because emotions run so hot.
0x8513570: Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear missiles, the decision to use tactical nuclear missiles is in some cases left up to battlefield commanders.
0x8513614: It is pretty scary.
0x8513638: As long as nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the chances that someone is going to use them will also continue to grow...
0x85da900: Ironically, the policy of nuclear deterrence has prevented the elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x85da970: The entire basis for determining them to be illegal has been undermined by this military policy.
0x85da9e4: In other words, nuclear weapons cannot be declared illegal because we have an entrenched policy which makes them legal ipso facto.
0x861c17c: America and Russia are not the only countries with nuclear weapons.
0x861c1d0: During the Cold War, the UK, France and China publicly declared the existence of their own nuclear arsenals.
0x861c250: Since we entered the 21st century,
0x861c284: we have confirmed the existence of nuclear weapons programs in countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia.
0x861c31c: Nukes are steadily proliferating. The 21st century is paying for the 20th century's failure to plug the holes in the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)
0x861c3c0: and for the IAEA's failure to tighten nuclear control measures.
0x868fa58: The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was established in 1957 to oversee peaceful as well as military applications of atomic power.
0x868faf4: But the IAEA can only investigate those countries which request an investigation.
0x868fb58: Furthermore, the timing of the inspection must be approved by the country in question. They are not allowed to do sneak inspections.
0x868fbf0: The country that is being investigated can even dictate the nationality of the inspectors that they will allow in.
0x868fc74: In the late 1970's, Iraq would only allow inspectors from Bulgaria and Russia to enter the country.
0x868fce8: The IAEA does not even have the authority to level fines against countries who have committed infractions.
0x868fd64: After the Gulf War, they discovered that Iraq had been developing nuclear weapons in secret right under the investigator's noses!
0x868fdf8: Unfortunately, as an organization, the IAEA just did not have the teeth to effectively stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
0x8757a04: In 1970, all five nuclear powers, America, the Soviet Union, France, England and China, signed the NPT.
0x8757a7c: The treaty provided that the non-nuclear equipped countries could receive assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear power.
0x8757b10: But military applications of nuclear power were strictly prohibited,
0x8757b68: and the IAEA was given the responsibility of investigating countries who were suspected of being in non-compliance with the NPT.
0x8757bfc: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x8757c58: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between
0x8757ce4: ...which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x87fe930: That stuff that is flowing in those ditches on the 1st floor must be radioactive nuclear waste water.
0x87fe9a8: You had better stay away from it. You are already exposed enough just by being in that area. Any further exposure could be fatal.
0x87fea3c: That place does not have a nuclear processing facility.
0x87fea84: It must be some other kind of nuclear material that is leaking besides the dismantled nuclear warheads...
0x87feb00: ...probably spent nuclear fuel or something.
0x88558fc: Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear reactor, it will always produce, as a waste product,
0x8855968: some spent-fuel mixed with highly toxic, radioactive compounds.
0x88559b8: Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive for 300 years. In other words, this material will remain lethal for the next three three centuries.
0x8895134: There was a time when we thought it was safe to seal the nuclear waste in special containers...
0x88951a4: and bury it in a layer of rock salt without much exposure to underground water.
0x8895204: Even though we now know there are big problems with that, we still don't have an effective disposal solution.
0x8895284: Most of the nuclear waste we produce is just shoved underground with no intention of ever processing it.
0x8895300: It is like an ostrich with its head in the sand. No?
0x88e99cc: There is a process which involves mixing the nuclear waste with low grade uranium to convert it into a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...
0x88e9a60: ...for burning in light water reactors, usually in the form of glass logs.
0x88e9abc: But MOX contaminates a nuclear reactor more quickly than low grade uranium. It is also highly toxic.
0x88e9b34: It is economically unfeasible unless the price of uranium is more than four times what it currently is.
0x88e9bac: Not only that, you cannot ignore the danger inherent in transporting the MOX from the processing factories to the nuclear reactors.
0x88e9c40: An accident could lead to radioactive contamination or the materials could be hijacked by terrorists...
0x88e9cb8: No, I do not think MOX could be called a viable solution to the problem of plutonium disposal.
0x8979200: There is only one effective use for nuclear waste.
0x8979244: Military applications. You see, after chemical reprocessing, they can separate plutonium from the nuclear waste.
0x89792c8: Nuclear weapons normally use military grade plutonium 239 with a purity of 93-94%.
0x897932c: It is made in special nuclear reactors designed for military applications.
0x8979388: On the other hand, the plutonium in spent nuclear fuel only has a purity of about 60%.
0x89793f0: But that does not mean that spent nuclear fuel cannot be used for military applications.
0x897945c: America has been successful in tests using weapons made from nuclear reactor grade plutonium.
0x89794cc: That means that eventually everyone will be able to make nuclear weapons from plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel.
0x8a2123c: Spent nuclear fuel can also be used to make depleted uranium (DU) bullets or shells. They are armor- piercing anti-tank rounds.
0x8a212cc: DU is two-and-a-half times denser than steel and 50% denser than lead, so it makes it an extremely effective armor-piercing weapon.
0x8a21360: It can cut through tank armor like a hot knife through butter.
0x8a213b0: Unfortunately, when a DU round explodes, it spreads a fine dust which, when absorbed into a body,
0x8a21424: supposedly causes terrible long-term health problems including genetic damage.
0x8a21484: During the Gulf War, American as well as Iraqi soldiers were exposed to DU dust and suffered from radiation poisoning and other illnesses.
0x8a21520: The American government conducted research to discover whether exposure could lead to cancer or genetic damage,
0x8a215a0: ...but the results were inconclusive.
0x8a215d8: Some people think that this type of radioactive contamination is what is behind the Gulf War Syndrome ,
0x8a21654: but the government will not admit it...
0x8ade928: They are currently doing research to find ways to transform minor actinoids such as Americium and Neptunium,
0x8ade9a8: which are highly toxic with long half lives, into nuclear materials with short half lives.
0x8adea14: It's called extinction processing, but it's not being used much due to all the technical and economic problems with it.
0x8adea9c: A serious program for nuclear waste treatment has yet to be established.
0x8b2e104: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x8b2e16c: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x8b2e1f4: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x8b2e254: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x8b71898: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x8b8c0a0: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x8b8c100: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x8ba80f4: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x8ba8160: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x8ba81d0: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x8be68b4: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x8c0b0e8: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x8c0b160: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x8c0b1c4: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x8c44100: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x8c441a0: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x8c4421c: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and dramatically.
0x8c86930: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x8c8698c: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x8c86a24: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x8c86a98: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x8cda3f0: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x8cda47c: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x8cda4f4: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x8cda578: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x8cda5ec: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x8cda62c: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x8cda694: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x8cda6e4: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x8cda750: You don't mean...
0x8cda774: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x8cda808: ..........
0x8cda824: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x8cda8a0: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x8cda8e0: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x8cda964: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x8cda9c4: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x8cdaa18: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x8e2c26c: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x8e2c2c4: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x8e2c310: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x8e2c360: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon system as well.
0x8e2c3cc: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x8e2c45c: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x8e2c4e0: You're a tough lady.
0x8e2c508: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x8e2c558: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x8e2c5b8: Unfortunately, all I can do from here IS provide you with information...
0x8e2c614: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x8e2c6a0: Same here, Snake.
0x8ee314c: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x8ee3190: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x8ee31fc: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x8ee324c: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x8ee32e8: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x8ee3368: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x8f440a8: Security cameras? Da. 
0x8f440d0: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff, you will be able to disable it.
0x8f65180: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x8f651e0: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x8f65274: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x8f652e4: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x8f65330: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x8f653a0: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x8fda89c: Snake, that room is set with infrared sensors. You should be able to see them if you had some smoke... cigarette smoke or something.
0x8ff693c: Sorry, but these are smokeless cigarettes.
0x8ff6978: You mean those cigarettes that are designed to cut down on second- hand smoke?
0x8ff69d8: Oh well. don't worry... If you blow the smoke in the direction of the infra-red sensors, you should be able to see them.
0x8ff6a64: That was a good idea bringing the cigarettes. But don't smoke too much. Cigarettes make you weak, in mind and body. They are bad for you.
0x90458bc: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x9045904: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x906c138: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x906c1c0: Sometimes they are called flash bangs or sound and flash grenades .
0x906c21c: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x906c294: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x90c3130: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x90c31c8: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x90c3200: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x90c325c: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x9115904: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x91159a4: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar. 
0x9115a04: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x9159268: A cardboard box.
0x915928c: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x915931c: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x91593a8: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x9159418: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x91594b4: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like 
0x9159544: wood or something.
0x9159568: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x91595d0: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x9159604: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x920b0b8: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x920b118: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you.
0x92311ac: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape in almost any way you want.
0x9231234: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x9231284: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x9231300: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x923133c: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x92313c4: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x9231418: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies, so be careful.
0x92b48ec: That is a FAMAS.
0x92b4910: It is a bullpup style assault rifle. It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x92b49b0: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a 25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x92f00d4: He's using a Single Action Army? The first model of that gun was made in 1873...over 130 years ago.
0x92f0148: Today they're still being made in small numbers, but that's just for collectors and such. Nobody uses them in combat anymore...
0x9321884: Biggest drawback to revolver style handguns is the reload time. That's your chance.
0x93328d0: Snake, there are Gun Cameras somewhere around there. They'll open fire automatically if they detect you. Be careful.
0x9332958: You should be able to confuse their sensors briefly with your chaff. Get past them while they are disabled!
0x9361878: You could also destroy them with your Stinger missiles.
0x936e064: That area is mined?
0x937386c: If you only had a Mine Detector...
0x937d07c: After you locate the mines on your radar, crawl forward and retrieve them.
0x938c950: Anti-personnel mines have killed over 20,000 non-combatants in the past thirty years.
0x938c9b8: In countries like Cambodia and Nicaragua, the killing and maiming of innocent victims continues long after the wars have ended.
0x938ca48: It is easy to plant the mines, you see, but removing them is a different matter.
0x938caac: It requires more time and manpower than anyone is willing to invest.
0x938cb04: The superpowers need to donate more mine detectors and other equipment to remove them. It is the least we could do after laying them.
0x93ec968: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x93ec994: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x93ec9d8: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x93eca50: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x93ecae0: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x93ecb50: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x945590c: That M1 tank is equipped with advanced vetronics. Once it locks on to a target, it automatically tracks it,
0x9455988: and its main gun is effective up to 3000 meters.
0x94559cc: To get close, you'll have to confuse it's tracking system. Use your Chaff.
0x9455a28: If you can jam the system and get close enough, it won't be able to use its main gun.
0x949b87c: Use your Chaff at a long distance to fool its electronic systems.
0x94aa128: Even if you can get close, the M1 tank's maximum speed is 45 miles per hour. First, you'll have to slow it down.
0x94aa1ac: Go after its caterpillars with C4 or Grenades.
0x94aa1ec: Once it slows down, toss a Grenade in the commander's turret.
0x94aa23c: The M1 has exceptionally strong armor.
0x94aa274: With your weapons, the only way to beat it is to attack the soldiers inside through the hatch.
0x94fa874: Try to aim at the upper hatch with your grenades.
0x95050c0: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x9505118: It is designed to prevent bullets frompenetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x952e144: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x952e1b4: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x952e1f4: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x952e284: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x952e2e0: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x9589108: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x9589180: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents,
0x9589204: you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is a Gas Mask.
0x95cd100: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x95cd15c: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x95cd1d4: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x960d95c: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x960d988: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful, unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x960da14: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being heard.
0x960da70: The outside is made of reinforced plastic and the inside is made from an acetate weave.
0x960dad8: Also the eye pieces are specially treated so they won't fog up.
0x960db28: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x9672880: Look at him move! ...He must have some kind of powered exoskeleton.
0x9682948: Powered exoskeleton? You mean like prosthetic arms and legs?
0x9682998: No. Prosthetics are intended to replace original body parts. That ninja's exoskeleton makes him far stronger than any normal human.
0x9682a2c: He is a true cyborg... a cybernetic organism.
0x9682a6c: So he's half machine, huh...?
0x9682a9c: I heard rumors about the experiments, but I had no idea that such a creature really existed...
0x96d5084: Snake, to save Dr. Emmerich, you must defeat that ninja. Don't give up.
0x96e7874: Snake, that is a woman's bathroom. You should not be in there!
0x96f389c: But I saw Meryl go in here.
0x96f38c8: Even so, Snake!
0x96f38e8: This is our only chance to talk alone together. I was sure she was in here..
0x970c06c: You found Meryl. 
0x97149b8: Meryl is acting kind of strange...
0x97149ec: It could be the stress of battle. ...I have a friend who had Chechan Syndrome .
0x9714a50: He became depressed six months after returning from Chechnya and took his own life.
0x9714ab8: He was forced to fight people who spoke his own language...people with his own culture. He couldn't live with the guilt of it...
0x9714b4c: It sounds like PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.
0x9714b94: A lot of veterans returning from Vietnam suffered from that...in fact, many still do.
0x9714bfc: Yes, it is also similar to the Afghan Syndrome. In Meryl's case, it is probably a much more short-term condition...
0x978d06c: Try to cheer her up. She'll come out of it.
0x9795878: Meryl is definitely not herself. Could she be dragged?
0x97a38c8: A psychic soldier...yes. Although they won't admit it, many countries have paranormal programs and use psychics in their special ops.
0x97a3960: Psychics range in power from those who can bend spoons to those who can cause natural disasters.
0x97cf878: But Psycho Mantis is one of the most powerful. Be careful.
0x97dd978: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x97dd9c8: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x97dda54: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You'll be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x97ddad0: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x97ddb2c: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Don't use them for too long a period of time.
0x984d110: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x984d188: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x984d208: You will be able to spot claymores too.
0x984d240: But they will tire your eyes out, so don't use them too much.
0x9894880: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x98a60a4: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x98a60cc: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering. 
0x98a6128: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x98c50a8: Snake, you cannot win without a sniper rifle...you cannot save the girl either.
0x98c5108: Find a sniper rifle. It is the only way to save Meryl.
0x98e497c: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x98e49d4: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x98e4a4c: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. It is best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x98e4ae4: When you're shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x98e4b60: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x99578a4: Just because you're locked up does not mean there is no chance of escape.
0x9957900: Keep your eyes and ears open and when you see a chance, take it.
0x9975078: You should call Campbell and wait for his instructions.
0x9981080: Snake, do you like the atmosphere there or something? Hurry up and escape!
0x9991090: What about your equipment? You're not going to leave behind everything you've collected are you? Hurry! Grab your stuff.
0x99a7070: Snake, hurry up to the Communications Tower.
0x99b189c: That was a close one. I didn't think they would go so far as to booby trap your equipment. ...sneaky bastards.
0x99cc07c: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x99da87c: When you're in a dark place, you should use Night-Vision or Thermal Goggles.
0x99e9144: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x99e91ec: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x99e922c: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x9a370a4: To beat that Hind, you need a SAM, a surface to air missile.
0x9a370f4: You cannot shoot it down with just small arms fire. If only you had a Stinger...
0x9a558bc: Only a handful of pilots in the world could operate a Hind in a blizzard like this.
0x9a55920: The IR and night-vision equipment would be useless. He must be flying on manual. That means your Chaff won't work.
0x9a7d090: The Hind is still around. You'll need a surface to air missile to take him on. Like a Stinger or something...
0x9a9307c: You are under long-distance attack. Shoot back with your sniper rifle.
0x9aa1980: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x9aa19b4: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x9aa1a38: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x9aa1a84: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x9aa1b20: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x9aa1b64: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x9b14084: You have Stinger missiles. Now you have at least got a chance against the Hind...
0x9b2492c: Only a chance?
0x9b2494c: Well you are not exactly evenly armed. 
0x9b24984: That Hind is a monster. You have only a small chance to win, but at least it's better than no chance...
0x9b249fc: That a pretty grim analysis, Nastasha.
0x9b24a34: To shoot down that Hind, you will have to get to a place with good visibility.
0x9b24a94: Do not try to fight in that walkway. Get up on that roof where you will have a clean shot at him.
0x9b6a0b0: Your best chance is to hit him while he is circling, when his nose isn't pointed at you. That is your opening. Shove a Stinger missile up his butt!
0x9b8c898: That machine gun can rip you to shreds in seconds.
0x9b8c8dc: When it is facing in your direction, you'd better hide in the shadows up there.
0x9ba50bc: You cannot move while operating your Stinger missile.
0x9ba5104: Focus your sights on that bird as soon as it shows its tail. When its gun turret is aimed at you, quickly hide in the shadows.
0x9ba5194: Use your R1 Button effectively.
0x9bcc09c: That Hind is equipped with infrared and night-vision equipment. It can fly even in pitch darkness. But there's one thing...
0x9be7878: My God, you actually shot down that Hind...
0x9be8dec: #2?<A9,1
0x9bf488c: You're the one who said I could do it with a Stinger. ...You didn't really think I had a chance, did you?
0x9bf4908: It's not that...
0x9c078b4: Well after all, that Hind shot down two F-16s.
0x9c078f4: It is hard to believe that after doing that it got taken out by just one man...nice going, Snake.
0x9c2c8b0: Stealth camouflage? Yes. That is the new material, recently developed, which hides a person's body by bending light.
0x9c2c938: I think you should ask the person who invented it.
0x9c4f06c: Use the Thermal Goggles like Dr. Emmerich said.
0x9c580a4: If you don't have Thermal Goggles, there is not much you can do.
0x9c580f8: Try to watch for a faint disturbance in the air. That's where your stealth soldiers are.
0x9c758b8: Sniper Wolf....It is pretty unusual for a sniper to announce their presence before they shoot. She must have a real thing for you.
0x9c7594c: Anyway, I do not think it is going to be as easy as before.
0x9c9c8a4: Snake, to get to the underground base, you have to get past the snowfield where Sniper Wolf is waiting.
0x9c9c91c: You will have to take care of her to complete your mission.
0x9cba864: What?
0x9cba87c: What is it...?
0x9cc2064: What are you staring at...?
0x9cc8864: Come on, Snake...
0x9ccf068: Don't stare at me like that...
0x9cd6874: What are you doing?
0x9cd6898: We've got to get a move on.
0x9ce3860: Snake!
0x9ce8864: What are you doing!?
0x9cee864: What are you thinking?
0x9cf5080: How could you...
0x9cf50a4: Why?
0x9cf50bc: Snake...
0x9d09078: Why did you do it...
0x9d090a0: Snake...
0x9d18860: Snake...
0x9d1e868: Damn! A surveillance camera!
0x9d28060: I'll drive!
0x9d2d864: Damn! No keys!
0x9d35064: All right! Keys!!
0x9d3c868: I got it, Snake! Jump in!!
0x9d44874: Fire that machine gun with your weapon button.
0x9d448b4: Shoot'em, Snake!
0x9d51068: Snake, hurry! Get in!
0x9d59064: What are you doing?
0x9d5f060: Hurry!!
0x9d64860: Snake!!
0x9d6a864: Snake, hold on!
0x9d71864: Uh oh, Snake. Check point!
0x9d77060: We'll never make it!
0x9d7b864: Snake, clear a path!!
0x9d80860: Shoot those drums!
0x9d85064: Snake, strafe those guards!!
0x9d8b060: Snake, shoot'em!!
0x9d8f064: Okay, Snake. Let's go!
0x9d94864: We're not out of the woods yet!
0x9da0868: What? What is it...?
0x9da9864: What are you staring at...?
0x9db1064: Come on, Snake...
0x9db8868: Don't stare at me like that...
0x9dc2074: What are you doing?
0x9dc2098: We've got to get move on.
0x9dcf860: Snake!
0x9dd5864: What are you doing!?
0x9ddc064: What are you thinking?
0x9de3880: How could you...
0x9de38a4: Why...?
0x9de38bc: Snake...
0x9df9078: Why did you do it...?
0x9df90a0: Snake...
0x9e09864: Snake...
0x9e0f884: Snake?.....Don't be so impatient. Settle down. I need a little more time to get the cargo door open.
0x9e22070: I'll call you when I get the door open. Just wait a little. Okay?
0x9e2c890: The cargo door's open already. If you exit there and go north, you'll get to the Warhead Storage Building where Dr. Emmerich is being held.
0x9e42870: I'll head there now and wait for you. Hurry after me okay.
0x9e4c078: Snake, did you lose your way? The cargo door is on the 1st floor.
0x9e598b0: Snake, where are you going? The Warhead Storage Building is north. I can't believe it... Solid Snake is lost.....
0x9e59934: I guess it's true, the reality really can't live up to the legend.
0x9e7d874: Be careful, Snake. That air lock is set with infrared sensors.
0x9e890c0: You probably can't see them with your naked eyes, but there are infrared beams coming out of that wall.
0x9e89138: Touch any one of them, and the doors will seal off and the place will be flooded with poison gas.
0x9e891ac: Somehow you've got to get through without setting off those sensors.
0x9eb288c: A cardboard box? I heard stories from my uncle, but I always thought he was pulling my leg...I...I've got no comment.
0x9ec9094: If you go north from there, you'll eventually come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0x9ec90f8: Dr. Emmerich should be in the laboratory area in the 2nd floor basement.
0x9ee20fc: I'll go ahead and wait for you there.
0x9ee2134: Meryl.
0x9ee214c: What? Are you going to tell me to stay back cause I'm too green again?
0x9ee21a4: Nope. It's your decision. I can't stop you from doing what you want, but...
0x9ee2200: But?
0x9ee2218: Don't do anything stupid, okay?
0x9ee2248: Stupid? Boy...thanks for the great show of confidence...
0x9ee2294: Meryl....
0x9ee22b0: Anyway...I'll see you there.
0x9f23874: Dr.Emmerich should be in the laboartory area in the 2nd floor basement.
0x9f30084: The place is mined? Well, if you use a Mine Detector, you'll be able to see the mines displayed on your radar.
0x9f42878: If you need a Mine Detector, there should be one on the 2nd floor of the tank hangar.
0x9f4f878: I think you might be able to fool the tank's electronic systems with a Chaff Grenade.
0x9f5c8b4: No matter how good you are, there's no way you can match up against an M1 tank. All you can do is try to take out the person in the driver's seat.
0x9f5c958: With grenades, you should be able to attack the soldier on top of the tank too.
0x9f81964: You're incredible, Snake! You singlehandedly beat an M1 tank.
0x9f819b4: No big deal. But I'll bet that VR simulator you trained on didn't have any scenarios that put you one on one against a tank, did it?
0x9f81a4c: No. But there was no scenario where I had to work alone with a special forces soldier against a group of terrorists either.
0x9f81ad8: In real life, things never go the way you expect them to...especially on a battlefield.
0x9f81b40: I'm already holed up in the Warhead Storage Building. It looks like Dr. Emmerich is still fine, but I'm not sure for how much longer...
0x9fdf080: He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuke Bldg to the north.
0x9fef064: Hurry up this way, okay?
0x9ff40b0: Heavy arms fire in that area is strictly prohibited. An explosion could cause nuclear material to leak from one or more of the warheads...
0x9ff414c: ...and that would be a very serious problem. Please be careful.
0xa0180a4: It looks like they're equipped with gas masks.
0xa0180e4: That's because they are not supposed to use heavy arms.
0xa01812c: Ah. You mean they use chemical weapons, instead.
0xa03207c: If you use a gas mask, you should be able to survive that gas for a long time.
0xa04008c: Where is the gas mask?
0xa0400b4: On the 2nd floor basement of that building. So you'll have to go through there without one.
0xa052884: Snake, if you walk on that floor normally, it'll make a lot of noise and the enemy will hear you. Try crawling.
0xa06589c: Meryl, what are these holes in the walls for?
0xa0658dc: That's an air cleaner for blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.
0xa07e080: That's an air cleaner for blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.
0xa08e8a0: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held in his lab in the northeast part of that floor.
0xa08e904: They've flooded the area with gas to prevent him from escaping.
0xa0a6080: But there should be a gas mask on that floor too. If you use it, you'll be able to make it through easily.
0xa0b70c8: Deepthroat? No, I don't know anyone who calls himself that.
0xa0b7114: I see...
0xa0b7130: I wonder why he's trying to help you.
0xa0b7168: I have no idea.
0xa0b7188: A trap?
0xa0b71a0: Could be. But for the time being, I'll have to trust him...
0xa0e1080: I think the remote controlled missiles are on the 1st floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0xa0f0864: Where are the remote controlled missiles?
0xa0f6070: Snake, Dr. Emmerich is being held just north of there.
0xa101080: Meryl, this pile of corpses...is this your handiwork?
0xa1010c8: No way!
0xa11089c: I didn't think so.
0xa1108c0: Who could have done that?
0xa1108ec: You got me.
0xa110908: But he must be somewhere up ahead.
0xa11093c: Then I guess you'll just have to go and find out.
0xa12a86c: Hurry! Dr. Emmerich is in danger!
0xa132890: Ninja?
0xa1328a8: I've never heard of any member of FOX-HOUND like that....but you're going to have to do something about him if you want to save Dr. Emmerich.
0xa148864: Okay.
0xa14887c: Ready to go?
0xa150064: What took you so long, Snake?
0xa158068: Snake, what are you doing?
0xa15f860: Let's go, Snake.
0xa166064: Where are you going, Snake?
0xa16d86c: Snake...
0xa16d888: Leave me...!
0xa17c068: Get out of here, Snake...
0xa185868: Snake, run...!
0xa193068: Snake...
0xa193084: Please...
0xa19b860: You still haven't found Meryl?
0xa1a0094: Snake, the Warhead Storage Building that you're in has one floor above ground and two floors below ground. Why don't you search there too?
0xa1b9078: She said she was nearby, so she may be somewhere in the Warhead Storage Building.
0xa1c7090: She's dressed like one of the terrorists. But that's just on the outside, the inside hasn't changed. Watch for the way she walks...
0xa1de89c: Snake, she's dressed up like one of the terrorists. She won't be able to reveal herself if other soldiers are around.
0xa1de924: You'll have to find somewhere you can be alone with her.
0xa1fb880: Even dressed like that, she's all woman. You see? Isn't there somewhere only a woman can go?
0xa20e0a8: Did you find Meryl?
0xa20e0cc: Sort of. I'm positive I saw her come into this bathroom, but...
0xa20e11c: There's only one exit, right?
0xa20e14c: Yeah.
0xa20e164: Well then she must still be in there.
0xa22b86c: Is there any place she might be hiding in there?
0xa23386c: Snake, haven't you found Meryl yet?
0xa23b8f0: Thank God Meryl's okay. She's a tough one all right. Although when you look at her, it's hard to imagine how tough.
0xa23b974: It must be the walk.
0xa23b99c: Ha ha ha. Anyway, I'm glad she's okay.
0xa23b9d4: I also got a card key from her. I think I can use it to stop them from launching a nuke.
0xa26e084: Get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base. That's where the detonation code input system is.
0xa2800e4: Someone else must be controlling Meryl. Do something, Snake...save her.
0xa28013c: What am I supposed to do? I don't even know where he is.
0xa280188: Probably somewhere close by. He's just invisible.
0xa2801cc: How?
0xa2801e4: Stealth camouflage. A technology I developed...
0xa2b08a0: Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around the user in such a way that they're rendered nearly invisible.
0xa2b0924: But if you had Thermal Goggles, you'd be able to see him.
0xa2cd080: Anyway, you can't see him with your naked eyes, but there must be some way to make him show up.
0xa2dd880: Snake, someone is just controlling Meryl's mind. You should be able to save her.
0xa2ee8f0: A psychic soldier...what a waste. I guess fighting was all he ever knew...
0xa2ee94c: Are you feeling sorry for him?
0xa2ee97c: Mantis had incredible power...fantastic power. Maybe that power could have been used to make people happy.
0xa2ee9f8: ...It's a sad thing when you see all that power being used just for war.
0xa2eea54: ..........
0xa32d878: Snake, Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north. Hurry!
0xa33c10c: Snake, don't kill the dogs...Please?
0xa33c144: What are you talking about. If I don't kill them, they'll kill me.
0xa33c198: But those dogs are just innocent animals.
0xa33c1d4: If they were guilty, it'd be okay?
0xa33c208: ...But you...you keep dogs, don't you?
0xa33c240: So what?! This is war. My private hobbies have got nothing to do with it.
0xa33c29c: ..........
0xa37a878: Snake, those dogs...
0xa37a8a0: Gimme a break...
0xa384950: Otacon, have you ever seen a sniper rifle anywhere on this base?
0xa3849a4: A sniper rifle?
0xa3849c4: Meryl's been shot...by an extremely good sniper.
0xa384a08: Sniper...
0xa384a24: A high quality sniper rifle is the only way I can fight back.
0xa384a74: I...I saw a PSG-1 in the armory in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar.
0xa384ad4: The 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar? I have to go all the way back there?
0xa384b34: Well...yeah...
0xa384b54: What's wrong with you, Otacon?
0xa384b84: Oh...nothing.
0xa3df094: Otacon, where is there a sniper rifle?
0xa3df0cc: There's a PSG-1 in the armory in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar....
0xa3f5870: You should use your Night-Vision Goggles in dark places.
0xa3ff880: If you want Night-Vision Goggles, there's a pair in the lab at the Warhead Storage Building.
0xa410080: ..........
0xa41009c: What is it?
0xa4100b8: Wolf...I...just... forget it.
0xa420858: ..........
0xa42b11c: Otacon, are you still okay?
0xa42b148: Yeah. Thanks to the stealth camouflage, that is.
0xa42b18c: I have a favor to ask. I need your help.
0xa42b1c8: I was wondering when you'd ask. What should I do?
0xa42b20c: I've been captured. I'm locked up here in this cell.
0xa42b254: What cell?
0xa42b270: There's a big torture machine nearby.
0xa42b2a8: Okay. I know it. It's close. I'll be there right away.
0xa42b2f0: Thanks.
0xa475864: Otacon.
0xa479070: I'm headed your way now. Can't you just relax?
0xa482098: I'm relaxed. I just don't know how to kill time here.
0xa4820e0: Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.
0xa496870: What are you using the Codec for? I'm right here.
0xa4a0094: Did you use the Ketchup? It took me a long time to find that. It's exactly the right color and consistency too.
0xa4a0114: Use it wisely, okay?
0xa4b9870: What are you doing? Now's your chance to get outta there, Snake!
0xa4c48a8: Otacon, are you there?
0xa4c48d0: What is it?
0xa4c48ec: Was that you who opened the door just now?
0xa4c4928: What are you talking about?
0xa4c4954: So it wasn't you!...Which means that...
0xa4e3870: The door is open right? You've got to get out of there now!
0xa4ef060: You're right.
0xa4f287c: If you're looking for your items, they're near where you were being tortured. Why don't you go get them?
0xa503084: If you knew that, why didn't you just bring them to me?
0xa5030cc: The guard was scary.
0xa5030f4: ..........
0xa51806c: Is there any cold medicine on this base?
0xa52006c: What's wrong, Snake? You caught a cold?
0xa5288a4: I think there's some in the commander's room. There's a pharmaceutical storage room in the southwest of the 1st floor basement
0xa528934: ...of the Warhead Storage Building. There are other types of drugs there too.
0xa548888: I gave directions to another soldier who had caught a cold.
0xa5488d4: Well it looks like he gave the cold to me.
0xa55a884: So you figured out what I had in mind, huh?
0xa55a8c0: I can't believe it actually worked.
0xa56a0c0: It looks like you escaped. I'm glad.
0xa56a0f8: No thanks to you.
0xa56a11c: Too bad. I thought you'd be able to figure out what my plan was.
0xa56a170: What are you talking about? I was just lucky that security was careless.
0xa58f0b8: If you go straight down the underground passageway north of the Cave, you'll arrive at the Communication Towers.
0xa58f13c: You should be able to go over the glacier by using the Communication Towers' walkway.Head for the towers.
0xa5b5888: Snake, it's dark inside the Communication Towers. You should use your Night- Vision or Thermal Goggles.
0xa5c9078: If you want Thermal Goggles, there's a pair on the same floor as my lab.
0xa5d586c: There's a pair of Night-Vision Goggles near my lab.
0xa5de07c: Be careful. There are always a lot of soldiers guarding the Communication Towers.
0xa5ec878: The walkway is directly between the Communication Tower. Head for there.
0xa5fb1b0: Snake, that's the door to the walkway.
0xa5fb1e8: It won't open even if I use the card.
0xa5fb220: Huh? Oh that's right. I totally forgot...
0xa5fb25c: Do you know something?
0xa5fb284: That door sometimes gets frozen shut cause it's so cold outside.
0xa5fb2d8: Next time tell me before hand. So what should I do?
0xa5fb31c: It's impossible to open from the inside. They always used C4 or something from the outside...
0xa5fb38c: From the outside? You can't open it from the inside?
0xa5fb3d4: Sorry, it's impossible. But don't worry, you'll get through. There are two walkways that connect Tower A and Tower B. The other one's on the roof.
0xa5fb478: You should just use the walkway on the roof.
0xa6760e8: It's no good, Snake. It looks like that door is frozen shut. The only way to open it is to blow it open from the outside.
0xa676174: And since the walkway on the roof is destroyed, to get to Tower B, you'll have to take the walkway on the other side of that door.
0xa676208: If you had a rope, maybe you could lower yourself from the roof of Tower A to the other side...
0xa6b1874: Snake, there's a walkway up on the roof, too. You should use that one.
0xa6bf0c0: Otacon, I'm up on the roof.
0xa6bf0ec: That was a pretty fast climb.
0xa6bf11c: I wanted to go slowly. But someone there forced me to move faster.
0xa6bf170: Hmm. Well you can relax cause there's an elevator in Tower B.
0xa6e5068: That walkway will take you to Tower B.
0xa6ec870: Snake, the walkway is on the roof of Tower A.
0xa6f70a4: Snake, are you going to take on a Hind with your bare hands?
0xa6f70f4: I'm not that big a fool. Isn't there a weapon I can use against him somewhere?
0xa71209c: There are Stinger missiles in Communication Tower B. I'm pretty sure they're near the entrance to the walkway.
0xa71211c: If you had a rope, you could probably get them by dropping down from the roof.
0xa72e870: I saw a rope on the bottom floor of Tower A.
0xa7380cc: Wow, Snake. You're like an action movie star!
0xa73810c: Totally different.
0xa738130: Huh?
0xa738148: This is real. Not some prearranged stunt. If I screw up, there are no retakes.
0xa7381a8: Yeah...I guess you're right.
0xa762898: Snake, there are some places on the wall where steam from the heating system is spurting out. So be careful, it'll give you a nasty burn.
0xa77b868: Great job. You made it down!
0xa784068: It wasn't easy.
0xa789060: No problem.
0xa78e080: Maybe now would be a good time to blow that door open with some C4 so you can get through later.
0xa79d094: Snake, the doorway that leads from the walkway to Tower A is frozen shut. If you use some C4, you should be able to get through.
0xa7b4880: You're getting shot at? But to get where the Stinger missiles are, you have to make it down that walkway.
0xa7c6074: The Stinger missiles are in a small room near the entrance to the walkway.
0xa7d20c8: Snake, I'm heading your way.
0xa7d20f8: What are you talking about?
0xa7d2124: There's something I've got to ask you...
0xa7d2160: Well what is it?
0xa7d2184: Hmm...well ya see...I...I'll ask you when I see you...bye.
0xa7d21d0: Wait a minute!
0xa800070: Snake, I'm coming out there. Just hold on, okay?
0xa80b0e4: You're gonna go after that Hind now?
0xa80b11c: Yeah.
0xa80b134: I can still hear the sound of its rotors. It's just circling the tower. He must be waiting for you.
0xa80b1a8: Yeah, well you won't hear it for much longer.
0xa80b1e8: ...Good. In the meantime, I'll fix the elevator so you can use it later.
0xa83c884: I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that Hind. It might take some time, so don't hurry.
0xa84d86c: Please,Snake.You've got to save her.
0xa8560c8: Snake, are you okay!?
0xa8560f0: So far. How are you doing?
0xa85611c: Sorry. The elevator's not working yet. It's strange. There's no problem with the motor and the power is on. I need a little more time...
0xa87c098: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.
0xa8978c8: Otacon, I can't see them! What should I do?
0xa897904: Hmmm...Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around an object. That's how it makes them invisible.
0xa897980: But it doesn't have the ability to mask heat.
0xa8bf078: Use your themal goggles, Snake. You'll be able to see their heat signatures.
0xa8cc888: Huh? You don't have any Thermal Goggles? Well with your eyesight, you might be able to spot em if you look really hard.
0xa8e30a4: Otacon, which direction is the underground base?
0xa8e30e8: It's in the snowfield to the north of Tower B. The door is security level 6.
0xa8e3ed3: 42"/./#2
0xa8fd8a4: The weather is terrible. Make sure you don't get lost out there.
0xa8fd8f8: Snake, I don't have to tell you, but it's bitter cold out there. It'd be dangerous to stay out in the Snowfield too long.
0xa91d888: Otacon, where can I find ammo for the PSG-1?
0xa91d8c8: I...I can't tell you.
0xa931058: ..........
0xa93b878: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0xa949864: ...I'll be watching, Snake...
0xa94e884: If you take that cargo elevator down, you'll wind up in Metal Gear's underground base.
0xa960098: It's automatically set to go back and forth between the blast furnace and the underground maintenance base.
0xa960114: It's not there yet, so you'll just have to wait.
0xa9c7878: What's wrong, Snake?
0xa9d6870: You're a mess, Snake!
0xa9e306c: What's the matter?
0xa9e3090: Scared?
0xa9e406c: Too scared to show your face?
0xa9e5064: Come out and fight!!
0xa9e606c: Snake, come out and fight.
0xa9f0870: So Snake!
0xa9f088c: You learned fear!!
0xa9f1860: Die!!
0xa9f2864: Eat this!!
0xaa4686c: What's wrong, Snake!
0xaa500a0: If you leave a lot of footprints, you can confuse your enemy. But don't let your footprints reveal the direction you went in.
0xaa50130: Disguise your footprints to fool the enemy.
0xaa6d878: Those mice are Alaskan field mice. Don't worry. They can't hurt you.
0xaa7c140: Wild field mice don't have a thick layer of fat, but they can still survive the bitter winters here without hibernating.
0xaa7c1cc: They dig tunnels under the snow and that's where they stay warm.
0xaa7c220: Survival specialists, huh. I should learn from them.
0xaa7c268: But there's a dark side too. Sometimes the males will kill and eat offspring that's not their own.
0xaa7c2dc: To ensure the survival of their own genes, right?
0xaa7c320: Yeah. Pretty brilliant program, huh.
0xaacd884: If there are mice, that means there must be an exit somewhere. Follow the mice.
0xaadf878: Snake, that floor is designed so that your footsteps echo.
0xaaed164: Listen, Snake. There's a way to walk so that your footsteps won't be heard. I call it stalking'. Here's how you do it.
0xaaed1ec: First, put your weight on the opposite foot that you're going to step with. Then take a step so that your heel makes contact with the ground first.
0xaaed290: Then as you slowly lower the tip of your foot to the floor, gradually shift your weight onto that foot.
0xaaed308: Use your knees to maintain the subtle balance. Try it.
0xaaed350: I...I can't do it...
0xaaed378: Another way is to wear your socks over your shoes...
0xab4f074: If you crawl on your stomach, you won't make any noise either...
0xab5a924: You say the DARPA Chief is dead!?
0xab5a958: Yeah...According to Naomi, it was a heart attack.
0xab5a99c: It couldn't be...
0xab5a9c0: Well...it looks like all you can do now is find Kenneth Baker, the president of ArmsTech.
0xab5aa2c: He's in the 2nd floor basement, isn't he?
0xab5aa68: Yeah, on the other side of the wall that was cemented over.
0xab5aab4: Okay. Good luck, Snake. You can do it...
0xaba5100: A cardboard box, huh. Just like Zanzibar.
0xaba513c: It saved my skin more than a few times in Outer Heaven too.
0xaba5188: Getting the maximum use out of ordinary on hand objects is the first principle of survival. It's especially important for covert operations.
0xaba5228: I haven't forgotten what you taught me.
0xabe1124: The muzzle velocity of a bullet fired from a revolver is slower than one fired from an automatic. That's bad for you.
0xabe11ac: The slower a gun's muzzle velocity, the more damage it does.
0xabe11fc: That's cause the bullet will tend to lodge in the body instead of going right through.
0xabe1264: Those kind of wounds take a long time to heal. Sometimes they never do. I think that's part of the reason he likes that gun.
0xabe12f4: He's a real sick puppy, that Ocelot...
0xac32880: The biggest drawback to a revolver is the reload time. That's your chance!
0xac438ec: First the DARPA Chief and then President Baker die of a heart attack?
0xac43944: Yeah. Smells pretty rotten to me. Master, do you know anything?
0xac43994: No..., but there's definitely something going on. Keep your eyes open out there.
0xac79150: Master, does the name Deepthroat mean anything to you?
0xac79198: Deepthroat? What? You mean the guy from Watergate?
0xac791dc: No. But he uses the same name. Whoever he is, he's not part of our operation, but he's been giving me advice by Codec.
0xac79264: What?
0xac7927c: On top of that, he wasn't using burst transmission. It seems he was transmitting from somewhere on this base.
0xac792fc: Somewhere on the base?
0xac79324: Yes.
0xac7933c: ...I have no idea who that could be.
0xac79374: I see...
0xacd2088: Snake, that's probably some type of nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a gas mask.
0xace6874: He's just playing with you. Why don't you try throwing away your weapons?
0xacf3074: Meryl must be hiding somewhere in there. Search around.
0xacfe8a4: You managed to link up with Meryl. Good...So now you must have the card keys that will override the detonation code.
0xacfe92c: You should hurry, the time limit is running out.
0xad1f08c: Meryl's just being controlled. You're an expert at unarmed CQB (Close Quarters Battle), right? Stop her without using your gun, that's all.
0xad3587c: Meryl must have somehow been brainwashed. There should be some way to help her.
0xad45090: It's true...your enemy is a powerful telepath. But you've got more battle experience. You can do it, Snake!
0xad5e094: Psycho Mantis...what a pathetic man. He was born with all the right tools, but he never knew how to use them...
0xad7a09c: Those are wolf dogs in there. Just like their name, they're a cross between huskies and Alaskan wolves. They were bred to be used as sled dogs.
0xad969b4: They were trying to create an animal that would combine the gentleness of a dog with the endurance and ferocity of a wolf.
0xad96a40: But they didn't get the stamina and power they were hoping for.
0xad96a90: On top of that, their personalities wound up closer to wolves. Most of them won't even let you get close. That's why they never caught on.
0xad96b2c: Oh that's right. You're a musher.
0xad96b60: Yeah. And after they outlawed the use of hybrids in dog sled races in 2002, no one even wanted to breed them anymore.
0xad96be8: I heard that most of them were put to sleep after that...
0xad96c34: Yes, but some of the wolf dog pups that were thrown away went wild. I've heard that wild wolf dogs hunt in packs just like wolves.
0xad96cc8: Better be careful.
0xae148b0: You're as good as ever, Snake. Not only are you an expert at infiltration, but you're a skilled marksman too.
0xae14930: But never relax until you confirm a kill with your own two eyes.
0xae390d8: Normally, when a soldier is taken prisoner, he should only give up the Big 4.
0xae39138: That's name, rank, serial number and date of birth. But you're not any old soldier, Snake.
0xae391a4: I don't want you to tell them anything. Fortunately, you're strong enough to resist.
0xae6f09c: Don't say anything to tease or anger the person torturing you. If you make him mad, it'll be that much worse for you. You'll need to save your strength.
0xae8c0a0: If you get a chance to eat, don't pass it up. A prisoner can't be choosy.
0xae8c0fc: You need to get your strength back so you can escape when the opportunity presents itself.
0xaeab078: Snake, you'll get a chance to escape. Make sure you take it.
0xaeba09c: Master, I...
0xaeba0bc: Don't say it, Snake. You still have a mission to accomplish. That's all you should be concentrating on right now.
0xaed4874: In any case, don't you think you should contact Colonel Campbell?
0xaee0870: Snake, now's your chance. Take it. Get out of there!
0xaeec890: Snake, what happened to your items? You're not going to try to finish this mission barehanded are you? Get your items.
0xaf04094: Now that you've got your stuff back, you should take a good look through it. If you're slow equipping an item in battle, it could mean death.
0xaf1d8e4: That was too close, Snake.
0xaf1d910: Yeah. That was quite a surprise all right.
0xaf1d94c: Hiding a bomb in your items...that's a despicable act. He should never... Well, forget it. You'd better hurry to the underground base.
0xaf1d9e4: You're almost out of time.
0xaf50884: You caught a cold, Snake? In battle you need to be in top physical condition. Do you have any cold medicine?
0xaf64880: The wolf dogs aren't attacking? Are you carrying something that might be causing them to act like that?
0xaf760a8: Your C-rations are frozen? Never eat frozen C-rats. It'll cause a temperature imbalance that'll drain your strength.
0xaf76130: Make sure you warm those C's before you eat em.
0xaf970b4: So you beat Wolf, huh. She was a fool to use the same tactics that failed her in your first meeting.
0xaf9712c: But remember. Don't let down your guard until you've got a confirmed kill.
0xafbe170: Master, you and I...we're nothing more than dogs, are we?
0xafbe1bc: That's not like you, Snake...Don't let what Sniper Wolf say bother you.
0xafbe214: ..........
0xafbe230: Listen. There's not a soldier alive that doesn't question himself. And if there is one, he's nothing more than a murderer.
0xafbe2bc: But someone like Wolf...a soldier who's looking for nothing more than their own death is no good to anyone either.
0xafbe340: Once she started to look for death, it was all over.
0xafbe388: That's how you'll end up too, Snake...
0xb02a880: One way to prevent your C-rations from freezing is to hold them close to your body by equipping them.
0xb03c088: Sound travels better in cold environments. If you're going to use a handgun, you should equip a suppressor.
0xb0518d0: When the temperature falls down to minus 30 or minus 40 degrees celsius, you start to get ice fogs. That's when the moisture in the air freezes.
0xb051974: It may look pretty at first, but it'll severely limit your visibility. Be careful.
0xb0818e8: Kipling, an English poet who also won the Nobel prize, said that once you go beyond 65 north,
0xb081958: you're beyond the reach of divine protection and human law.
0xb0819a4: To survive in such surroundings, you have to be strong enough to not rely on God nor anyone else.
0xb0ba08c: In cold like this, over 70% of your body warmth is lost through your head. Put on some kind of hat.
0xb0cf8c4: In an arctic environment, it's important to change your underwear if you're sweating a lot. Dawdle around too much and you'll not only waste your
0xb0cf968: strength, but you could even catch pneumonia. Gaming after a bath should be avoided.
0xb0fa8d4: It's easy to dehydrate in sub-zero climates, so make sure to replenish your fluids. But don't ever try to do it by eating snow.
0xb0fa964: You'll freeze your stomach and your body temperature will drop. Always melt the snow and then boil it before you drink it.
0xb12a8a4: No cold foods or cold liquids for you. That stuff causes a temperature imbalance that actually drains your body of energy.
0xb12a930: A golden rule in arctic environments.
0xb149888: I hate hats. Is a bandanna okay?
0xb1498bc: Well, I guess it's better than nothing...
0xb15b0b8: Don't suddenly look into the dark. Look slowly from a light area to a darker area.
0xb15b11c: If you do that, your eyes will gradually adjust and you'll be able to see better in the dark. Try not to play in the dark either.
0xb1828c0: When you're fighting in the dark, you need to use your sense of hearing and smell. Don't trust your eyes, use your ears.
0xb18294c: Feel the flow of the air with your whole body. That's the way to tell where your enemy is.
0xb1ad074: People sometimes panic in the dark. Try to stay cool.
0xb1ba8c4: When you're wearing Night-Vision Goggles, the light gets amplified a hundred-fold.
0xb1ba928: So if you look at an explosion or a Stun Grenade, you may burn your retinas. If that happens, it'll take a little while until your vision returns.
0xb1e58bc: Snake, you've got to think. Your mind is your most dangerous weapon. If things are getting too complicated, try to simplify your thoughts.
0xb1e5958: You can also try calling Campbell for advice.
0xb20d0dc: Soldiers that have been forged in the fires of battle are used to catching naps whenever and wherever they can.
0xb20d15c: There's a big difference between real soldiers and those kids who have only been trained in VR simulators.
0xb20d1d8: After playing for a long time, you should get some rest too.
0xb243898: People's reaction speed is slowest around three o'clock in the morning, and so is their judgment.
0xb24390c: If you're feeling drowsy, you should get some sleep.
0xb25f0bc: It's also important to be able to control your bodily functions.
0xb25f110: You never know when a long demo is about to begin, so make sure you're prepared to sit in front of the monitor for a long time if necessary.
0xb2868a0: It's never a good idea to fight on too full a stomach. It'll make you logy...maybe even sleepy.
0xb286910: You should wait 30 minutes after eating before you play.
0xb2a5880: Where I come from, a soldier who loses his head in combat is called a target .
0xb2b70a0: Military C-rations place an emphasis on calories.
0xb2b70e4: That's why it's best to use them along with some other type of nutritional supplement such as vitamins or minerals.
0xb2d50a4: People who have been through war and survived develop a kind of sixth sense to warn them of danger. Trust your instincts as a soldier, as a gamer.
0xb2f48b0: In war, a split second can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Don't ever hesitate.
0xb2f4920: The slower you react, the greater the chance that you'll be beaten.
0xb3198b4: That inner voice that warns you when danger is nearby...you can't learn that in training.
0xb319920: You've got to have survived a few firefights...seen a few friends blown away before you learn that trick.
0xb3408bc: When you're trying to hide, avoid places that look like the enemy might search.
0xb34091c: Think about how your enemy is going to move and then sneak in there. It doesn't matter how smart you are, just use your head out there.
0xb369080: Snake, divide and conquer. Try to take your enemies on one at a time.
0xb37a888: You need to make snap decisions. In war, the difference between living and dying is counted in milliseconds.
0xb38e89c: The basic law of CQB (Close Quarters Battle) is to take your enemy out as quickly and efficiently as possible
0xb38e91c: while maintaining your own escape route.
0xb3a98a4: Don't use your gun unless you need to. If you can get out of a jam using just your hands and feet, then do it. If you can't, then go for the gun.
0xb3c98a4: Soldiers who lose their heads on the battlefield usually lose their heads on the battlefield. Get my meaning? Always have your next action planned.
0xb3e9898: Think carefully about your hiding spots. You may find a place where you can hide perfectly, but if you can't get your mission done, it's meaningless.
0xb4048b0: Always use the most appropriate weapon for the situation.
0xb4048fc: If you use a weapon that's not really doing the job, not only are you wasting ammo, but you're also putting your life in danger.
0xb428088: One way of letting yourself know when to change a magazine is to make the last few rounds of the mag tracers.
0xb43b8b0: Plan your strategy based on the enemies' positions. Try to think like the enemy commander would think.
0xb43b928: If you can put yourself in the map designer's mind, a lot of doors will open for you.
0xb460890: Once you give up hope, it's all over. That's when you can't do anything right. Despair leads to death, you know.
0xb47b080: You've got to believe. If you believe with your whole heart, you will succeed.
0xb48e0bc: Sometimes in combat or when you're near the end of your rope, you can see things that normally aren't there or shouldn't be there.
0xb48e150: Relax. It's not a bug. It's just the mysteries of the human mind.
0xb4ba09c: Think about something terrible that happened in your life. Everyone has had something bad happen to them.
0xb4ba118: It'll help take your mind off the misery of the battlefield.
0xb4d70ac: A real master of warfare alters his strategy to cope with changes in the battlefield conditions.
0xb4d7120: If you always follow the book, you'll be transparent to your enemy.
0xb4f88a0: War brings out the cruelty of man. No matter how the soldier was brought up, they all turn into animals when they're thrust into the heat of combat.
0xb5170a0: Sometimes, even though you know it's a losing battle, you just have to fight or be damned. A narrow chance is still a chance.
0xb5370b8: Foresight is important in war. In times of extreme danger, people's latent sixth sense often awakens.
0xb537130: When that happens, throw logic to the wind and trust your instincts.
0xb55f08c: The only way to conquer fear is to stare it straight in the face and laugh at it. Never let fear control you.
0xb577090: Don't feel guilty about the soldiers that died from your bullets. They knew the risks they were taking, just like you.
0xb58f89c: The weather in Alaska is very hard to predict. It can change on a dime. A lot of people say it's the worst weather in the world.
0xb5ad0c0: The most important tools you need to be a good sniper are the senses that you were born with. No amount of training can change those.
0xb5ad158: If your senses are dull from the beginning, you'll never be a great sniper.
0xb5d78cc: According to the SWAT manual, the longest a shooter can stay adequately focused on his target is 15 minutes.
0xb5d794c: After 15 minutes, the observer and the shooter change places. Sniping is usually a two man job.
0xb605884: It looks like your target is stationary. If you've had enough practice, it shouldn't be a difficult shot.
0xb6190b0: The scope of a sniper rifle is extremely powerful. On the other hand, it's got a very narrow field of vision.
0xb619130: If you're searching for your enemy's position, it'd be better to use your binoculars.
0xb8dd864: A surveillance camera...
0xb8e3064: A surveillance camera?
0xb92b85c: Huh?
0xb92f85c: Huh?
0xb93385c: Huh?
0xb93385c: Huh?
0xb97a05c: Damn!
0xbad4864: You...
0xbad487c: ...you win...
0xbaed05c: Huh?
0xbaed05c: Huh?

0x58bbc: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow
0x58bee: Moses Island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago was
0x58c1d: captured by terrorists. They're demanding that
0x58c4e: the US government turn over the remains of "The
0x58c80: Legendary Soldier" Big Boss and they are saying
0x58cb2: that if their demands are not met within 24 hours,
0x58ce7: they'll launch a nuclear weapon. Asked by the US
0x58d1a: government to settle the situation, former FOX-
0x58d4c: HOUND member Solid Snake succeeds in the
0x58d77: infiltration of the nuclear weapons disposal facility.
0x58db0: Now he must try to rescue the DARPA Chief.
0x58eaa: government to turn over the remains of " The
0x58f73: government to settle the situation, Snake overhears
0x58fa9: the enemies' conversation that the DARPA Chief is
0x58fdd: locked up in the cell on the first floor basement of
0x59014: the tank hanger.
0x59062: Snake gets in touch with the DARPA Chief. But the
0x59096: Chief says that the terrorists found out one of the
0x590cc: two detonation codes necessary to launch the
0x590fb: nuclear warhead. The Chief tells Snake that it is
0x5912f: possible to deactivate the detonation code by using
0x59165: the detonation code emergency override key held
0x59197: by ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker who is
0x591c4: trapped on the 2nd floor basement. However, right
0x591f8: after that, he dies from a heart attack right in front
0x59231: of Snake...
0x59413: after that, he dies from a heart attack. Snake
0x59444: cooperates with a female soldier that he met and
0x59477: escapes the cell and heads for the 2nd floor
0x594a6: basement of the tank hangar to rescue Baker.
0x595da: possible to deactivate the detonation code by
0x5960a: using the detonation code emergency override key
0x5963d: held by ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker who is
0x596a3: after that, he dies from a heart attack. Snake must
0x596d9: try to rescue Baker who is trapped on the other
0x5970b: side of the cemented wall on the 2nd floor
0x59738: basement of the tank hangar.
0x598bf: held by ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker. However,
0x598f4: right after that, he dies from a heart attack. Snake
0x5992b: must try to rescue Baker who is trapped on the
0x5995c: other side of the cemented wall on the 2nd floor
0x599e9: Snake saves President Baker from FOX-HOUND
0x59a16: member Revolver Ocelot. However, he has already
0x59a48: given away the detonation code. The only thing
0x59a79: that can stop the launch of the nuclear warhead is
0x59ae0: by Meryl, or Metal Gear chief engineer Dr. Hal
0x59b11: Emmerich.
0x59b1d: After talking to Snake, Baker also dies from a
0x59b4e: heart attack. Snake refers to the Codec frequency
0x59b82: on the back of the CD case and tries contacting
0x59bb4: Meryl.
0x59bfb: Snake rescues Baker, but just like the DARPA
0x59c2a: chief, he dies from a heart attack. The terrorists
0x59c5f: already know Baker's detonation code as well.
0x59c8f: The only thing that can stop the launch of the
0x59cc0: nuclear warhead is the detonation code emergency
0x59cf3: override key held by Meryl, or Metal Gear chief
0x59d25: engineer Dr. Hal Emmerich. Snake, successfully
0x59d56: contacting Meryl, has decided to go to the nuclear
0x59d8b: warhead storage building to rescue Dr. Emmerich
0x59dbd: as soon as Meryl opens the door on the first floor
0x59df2: to the north of the tank hangar.
0x59fab: contacting Meryl, opens the door on the first floor
0x59fe1: to the north of the tank hangar with her help.
0x5a012: To rescue Dr. Emmerich, Snake goes out of the
0x5a042: cargo exit and heads for the nuclear warhead
0x5a071: storage building up north.
0x5a1f3: engineer Dr. Emmerich.
0x5a20c: Snake, with the help of Meryl, heads for the nuclear
0x5a243: warhead storage building to rescue Dr. Emmerich.
0x5a276: However, the valley which is the only way to get
0x5a2a9: there turned out to be a minefield. Snake tries
0x5a2db: to go across the minefield.
0x5a4e1: In the meantime, Snake finds out of the existence
0x5a515: of a minefield through a call from a man who calls
0x5a54a: himself Deepthroat. Snake tries to go across the
0x5a57d: minefield.
0x5a5c2: Snake must try to rescue the Metal Gear chief
0x5a5f2: engineer Dr. Hal Emmerich to find out how to stop
0x5a626: the nuclear launch. With the help of Meryl, Snake
0x5a65a: gets through the tank hangar to the valley.
0x5a688: However FOX-HOUND member Vulcan Raven and
0x5a6b4: his M1 tank were waiting for him. Dodging the
0x5a6e4: attack of the tank cannon and destroying the tank,
0x5a719: Snake succeeds in infiltrating the nuclear
0x5a746: warhead storage building. He heads for the 2nd
0x5a777: floor basement where Dr. Emmerich is trapped.
0x5a7e5: Snake must try to rescue of Metal Gear chief
0x5a848: the nuclear launch. Snake gets to the 2nd floor
0x5a87a: basement of the nuclear warhead storage building
0x5a8ad: where Dr. Emmerich is trapped. However a floor
0x5a8de: with high voltage electric currents blocks his way.
0x5a914: The electric current is controlled by the high
0x5a945: voltage switchboard, which is in the northwest of
0x5a979: the nuclear warhead storage building 2nd floor
0x5a9aa: basement. He must destroy that to proceed. He 
0x5a9db: needs a remote control missile to do so.
0x5ac06: basement. He must destroy that to proceed. Snake 
0x5ac3a: gets ready to shoot the remote control missile.
0x5ad0b: the nuclear launch. Floors with high voltage electric
0x5ad43: currents blocked his way in the nuclear warhead
0x5ad75: storage building 2nd floor basement, but with
0x5ada5: Deepthroat's advice, Snake destroys the electric
0x5add8: control panel with a remote missile and goes past
0x5ae0c: this area. Snake heads for the northeast of the
0x5ae3e: nuclear warhead storage building 2nd floor
0x5ae6b: basement.
0x5af19: the nuclear launch. After going past the high
0x5af49: voltage electric floors in the nuclear warhead
0x5af7a: storage building 2nd floor basement, Snake sees
0x5afac: a bunch of dead enemy soldiers and the stealth
0x5afdd: camouflage shadow. Sensing the endangered
0x5b009: life of Dr. Emmerich, Snake heads for the lab in
0x5b03c: the northwest of the nuclear warhead storage
0x5b06b: building 2nd floor basement where he is trapped.
0x5b0dc: Snake successfully rescues Otacon, but is shocked
0x5b110: by the fact that the Ninja he drove away is his war
0x5b146: buddy Gray Fox. Discovering that Metal Gear has
0x5b178: been developed against his will as a nuclear missile
0x5b1af: launching walking tank, Otacon offers to help
0x5b1df: Snake. Snake tries to meet up with Meryl to get the
0x5b215: detonation code emergency override key that she
0x5b247: has. According to Otacon, Meryl is disguised as an
0x5b27c: enemy soldier.
0x5b2ce: After meeting up with Meryl, Snake gets the
0x5b2fc: detonation code emergency override key from her.
0x5b32f: However, she only had one of the three keys
0x5b35d: To stop the nuclear attack, one must deactivate
0x5b38f: the detonation code or destroy Metal Gear itself. 
0x5b3c4: Snake and Meryl head for the underground 
0x5b3f0: maintenance base where Metal Gear is being
0x5b41d: stored. 
0x5b428: According to Meryl, there is no way other than
0x5b459: going north from the Commander's room on the
0x5b488: 1st floor basement in the nuclear warhead
0x5b4b4: storage building.
0x5b564: However, she only had one of the three keys.
0x5b5c5: the detonation code or destroy Metal Gear itself.
0x5b5f9: Snake and Meryl head for the underground
0x5b651: stored, from the Commander's room on the 1st
0x5b680: floor basement in the nuclear warhead storage
0x5b6b0: building. But suddenly, Meryl starts acting
0x5b6de: weird...
0x5b727: To stop the terrorists' nuclear attack, one must
0x5b75a: deactivate the detonation code or destroy Metal
0x5b78c: Gear itself. Snake and Meryl head for the
0x5b7b8: underground maintenance base where Metal
0x5b7e3: Gear is being stored. However, FOX-HOUND
0x5b80e: member Psycho Mantis confronts them.
0x5b835: After losing the battle, Mantis tells Snake that
0x5b868: there is no way to get to the underground
0x5b894: maintenance base other than going north from
0x5b8c3: the Commander's room and through the cave
0x5b8ef: to the Communications Tower.
0x5b90e: Then Mantis dies.
0x5b9f1: Communications Tower -- the only way to the
0x5ba1f: underground maintenance base. FOX-HOUND
0x5ba49: member Sniper Wolf fires at them, and Meryl is
0x5ba7a: badly wounded. It is a trap to lure out Snake.
0x5baab: Snake must get a PSG1 to beat Wolf and save
0x5bbb4: Communications Tower. FOX-HOUND member
0x5bbdd: Sniper Wolf fires at them, and Meryl is badly
0x5bc0d: wounded. To save Meryl, Snake heads to the 2nd
0x5bc3e: floor basement of the tank hangar for the PSG1,
0x5bc70: the only weapon effective to fight against Wolf.
0x5bda6: underground maintenance base. However, on
0x5bdd2: their way through the underground passage, FOX-
0x5be04: HOUND member Sniper Wolf fires at Meryl.
0x5be2f: Acquiring the PSG1 -- the only weapon effective
0x5be61: to fight against Wolf, Snake heads back to the
0x5be93: underground passage to save Meryl.
0x5bfe1: their way through underground passage, Sniper
0x5c011: Wolf fires at Meryl. Acquiring the PSG1, Snake
0x5c042: beats Wolf. However, Meryl is no longer there.
0x5c073: Snake heads north to get clues to find Meryl.
0x5c175: underground maintenance base. Meryl is shot by
0x5c1a6: Sniper Wolf and is taken hostage, and Snake is
0x5c1d7: also captured.
0x5c1e8: Enduring the torture with Meryl's life on the
0x5c218: line, Snake waits for an opportunity to escape
0x5c24a: the cell.
0x5c2ca: deactivate the detonation code or destroy
0x5c2f6: Metal Gear itself. Snake and Meryl head for the
0x5c39b: Suffering Ocelot's torture, Snake can no longer
0x5c3cd: resist the pain and submits. Ocelot tells him that
0x5c402: he will kill Meryl.
0x5c459: The government refused to fulfill the demands,
0x5c48a: the terrorists started preparing for launch. To stop
0x5c4c1: the launch, Snake must use the detonation code
0x5c4f2: emergency override key at the underground
0x5c51e: maintenance base or destroy Metal Gear itself.
0x5c54f: Taken hostage, Snake is subjected to Ocelot's
0x5c57f: torture. If he submits, Meryl will be killed.
0x5c5af: Campbell tells Snake, who is drained from the
0x5c5df: torture, that Metal Gear is equipped with a new-
0x5c612: type of nuclear warhead. Snake waits for
0x5c63d: an opportunity to escape the cell.
0x5c793: Taken hostage, Snake submits to Ocelot's
0x5c7be: torture and is told that Meryl will be killed.
0x5c7ef: While Snake is haunted with great regret,
0x5c81b: Campbell tells Snake that Metal Gear is equipped
0x5c84e: with a new-type of nuclear warhead. To stop the
0x5c880: launch, Snake waits for the opportunity to escape
0x5c8fb: After outlasting Ocelot's torture, Snake escapes
0x5c92e: from the cell. However, Meryl, taken as the other
0x5c962: hostage, cannot be found. The terrorist's demands
0x5c996: have been rejected and they are preparing to 
0x5c9c6: launch a new-type of nuclear warhead. To stop
0x5ca53: maintenance base up north, or destroy Metal
0x5ca81: Gear itself.
0x5ca90: Snake first collects his belongings and then
0x5cabf: heads north for the underground maintenance
0x5caed: base.
0x5cb63: from the cell with the help of Ninja. However,
0x5cb94: Meryl, taken as the other hostage, cannot be
0x5cbc3: found. The terrorist's demands have been
0x5cbee: rejected and they are preparing to launch
0x5cc1a: a new-type nuclear warhead. To stop that,
0x5cc46: Snake must use the detonation code emergency
0x5cc75: override key at the underground maintenance
0x5cca3: base up north, or destroy Metal Gear itself.
0x5cd6f: After Snake submits to the torture, Ocelot tells him
0x5cda6: that Meryl will be killed. While being torn apart by
0x5cddd: the feelings of regret, Snake managed to escape
0x5ce0f: from the cell. The terrorist's demands have been
0x5ce42: rejected and they are preparing to launch a new-
0x5ce75: type of nuclear warhead. To stop that, Snake must
0x5cea9: use the detonation code emergency override key
0x5ceda: at the underground maintenance base up north,
0x5cf0a: or destroy Metal Gear itself. Snake first collects
0x5cf3f: his belongings and then heads north for the
0x5cf6d: underground maintenance base.
0x5d036: the feelings of regret, Snake escapes from the 
0x5d068: cell with the help of Ninja. The terrorist's demands
0x5d09f: have been rejected and they are preparing to
0x5d0ce: launch a new-type of nuclear warhead. To stop that,
0x5d133: override key at the underground maintenance base

0x5d19c: collects his belongings and then heads north for
0x5d1cf: the underground maintenance base.
0x5d22e: The terrorists have started preparing to launch a
0x5d262: new-type of nuclear warhead. To stop that, Snake
0x5d295: must use the detonation code emergency override
0x5d2c7: key at the underground maintenance base up
0x5d2f4: north, or destroy Metal Gear itself. After outlasting
0x5d32c: Ocelot's torture, Snake escapes from the cell.
0x5d35d: However, Meryl, taken as the other hostage,
0x5d38b: cannot be found. Snake makes a detour around the
0x5d3be: glaciers and heads for the Communications Tower
0x5d3f0: to enter the underground maintenance base.

0x5d623: Communications Tower to enter the underground
0x5d653: maintenance base.
0x5d6d9: that Meryl will be killed. While in despair, Snake
0x5d70e: escapes from the cell. The terrorists have started
0x5d743: preparing to launch the new-type nuclear warhead.

0x5da86: escaping from the cell with the help of the Ninja,
0x5dabb: Snake makes a detour around the glaciers and
0x5daea: heads for the Communications Tower to enter the
0x5dc38: base up north, or destroy Metal Gear itself. After
0x5dc6d: outlasting Ocelot's torture, Snake escapes from.
0x5dca0: the cell. However, Meryl, taken as the other
0x5dccf: hostage, cannot be found. Snake infiltrates the
0x5dd01: Communications Tower and heads for the walk way
0x5dd33: on an upper floor to detour around the glaciers
0x5dd65: that block the way to the underground maintenance
0x5de7a: preparing to launch a new-type of nuclear warhead.
0x5deaf: To stop the launch, Snake must use the detonation
0x5df42: Gear itself. After escaping, Snake infiltrates the
0x5dfa9: on an upper floor to detour around the glaciers that
0x5dfe0: block the way to the underground maintenance
0x5e082: from the cell. However, Meryl, taken as the
0x5e0b0: other hostage, cannot be found. To detour
0x5e0dc: around the glaciers blocking the way to the
0x5e10a: underground maintenance base, Snake climbs
0x5e137: up to the roof of the Communications Tower A.
0x5e167: However, Liquid and his Hind D are waiting for
0x5e198: him. The walkway collapses from the Hind's
0x5e1c5: attack. The only way left to proceed is to go
0x5e1f5: down the wall on the north side of the roof of 
0x5e227: Communications Tower A. A rope is necessary
0x5e255: to do so.
0x5e299: After Snake submits to the torture, Ocelot tells
0x5e2cc: him that Meryl will be killed. While being in
0x5e2fc: despair, Snake escapes from the cell. To detour
0x5e35c: underground maintenance base, Snake climbs 
0x5e448: down the wall on the north side of the roof of
0x5e603: However, Liquid and his Hind D are waitinf for
0x5e6c2: Communications Tower A. With his rope, Snake
0x5e6f1: heads for the northern end of the roof of
0x5e71d: Communications Tower A.
0x5e9f5: To stop the launch of the new-type of nuclear
0x5ea25: warhead, Snake must use the detonation code
0x5ea7f: maintenance base up north, or destroy Metal Gear
0x5eab2: itself. After escaping from the cell, Snake climbs
0x5eae7: up Communications Tower A to detour around the
0x5eb18: glaciers blocking the way to the underground
0x5eb47: maintenance base. However, Liquid's Hind D
0x5eb74: destroys the walkway. To get out of this terrible
0x5eba8: situation, Snake starts rappelling along the wall of
0x5ebdf: Communications Tower A, depending totally on his
0x5ec12: rope.
0x5ec52: To stop the launch of the new-type ofnuclear
0x5ecdb: maintenance base up north or destroy Metal Gear
0x5edcf: blocks Snake's way. Snake starts rappelling down
0x5ee02: the wall of Communications Tower A to get to
0x5ee31: Communications Tower B. It was obvious that
0x5ee5f: there was no way for Snake to fight the Hind with
0x5ee93: any of his current weapons...
0x5efa4: itself. After escaping from the cell, Snake climbs up
0x5efdc: Communications Tower A to detour around the
0x5f0c8: Communications Tower B. To fight the Hind, Snake
0x5f0fb: must aquire the Stinger missiles at the Tower B
0x5f12d: entrance.
0x5f2c0: maintenance base but gets attacked by Liquid's
0x5f2f1: Hind D. Snake dodges the Hind's insistent attack
0x5f324: and rappels down the wall of Communications
0x5f352: Tower A. Acquiring a portable Stinger, Snake
0x5f381: heads for the roof of Communications Tower B to
0x5f3b3: finish the battle with Liquid.
0x5f409: To stop the launch of the new-type nuclear
0x5f4c2: itself. Snake gets attacked by Liquid's Hind D at
0x5f4f7: Communications Tower A, but he rappels down the
0x5f529: communications tower wall and acquires the
0x5f556: Stinger -- a weapon effective against the Hind.
0x5f588: Snake asks Otacon to move the elevator and then
0x5f705: itself. Snake fights Liquid's Hind D on the roof of
0x5f73b: Communications Tower B and defeats it. Snake
0x5f76a: gets the message from Otacon that the elevator of
0x5f79e: Communications Tower B has started moving again.
0x5f7d1: The entrance to the underground maintenance base
0x5f804: is beyond the Snowfield north of Communications
0x5f836: Tower B. Snake heads for the elevator of
0x5f861: Communications Tower B to go down to the
0x5f88c: Snowfield.
0x5f9c1: Communications Tower B and defeats it. After
0x5f9f0: taking the elevator in Communications Tower B
0x5fa20: and defeating the stealth camouflage soldiers,
0x5fa51: Snake heads for the entrance to the underground
0x5fa83: maintenance base beyond the Snowfield north of
0x5fab4: Communications Tower B.
0x5fc2b: takes the elevator in Communications Tower B and
0x5fc5e: defeats the stealth camouflage solders and gets to
0x5fc93: the Snowfield north of Communications Tower B.
0x5fcf6: maintenance base north of the Snowfield.
0x5fe4f: Communications Tower B and defeats it and gets
0x5fe80: to the Snowfield north of Communications Tower B.
0x5feb4: However, there awaits Sniper Wolf. After winning
0x5fee7: the sniping battle on the Snowfield, he heads for
0x5ff1b: the entrance to the underground maintenance base
0x5ff4e: north of the Snowfield.
0x600fb: However, Sniper Wolf is waiting for him. After
0x6012c: beating her again, Snake and Otacon stay with
0x6015c: her until her moment of death, Snake heads for
0x6018d: the entrance to the underground maintenance
0x601bb: base north of the Snowfield.
0x6039b: beating her again, Sanek and Otacon stay with
0x603cb: her until her moment of death, Snake successfully
0x603ff: goes through entrance to the underground
0x6042a: maintenance base north of the Snowfield and
0x60458: heads for the lower level to get to the Metal
0x60488: Gear underground maintenance base.
0x605d2: Communications Tower B and defeats it. He then
0x60603: gets to the Snowfield north of Communications
0x60633: Tower B and defeats Sniper Wolf again. After
0x606f1: maintenance base and takes the large cargo
0x6071e: elevator to get to the lower level of the Metal
0x60750: Gear underground maintenance base. 
0x60865: itself. While Snake heads down on the large cargo
0x60899: elevator from the blast furnace beyond the
0x608c6: Snowfield to get to the lower level after defeating
0x608fc: Sniper Wolf again, Snake hears from Master Miller
0x60930: that Naomi could be a spy. Snake cannot believe
0x60962: it, but all he can do now is to head for the
0x60a1c: warhead, Snake rushes to the underground
0x60a47: maintenance base. However, Vulcan Raven is
0x60a74: waiting for him. While Raven is dying after
0x60aa2: being defeated by Snake, he tells Snake that
0x60ad1: the DARPA Chief who died in front of Snake
0x60afe: was actually FOX-HOUND member Decoy Octopus
0x60b2c: in disguise. Snake, who has been told by Master
0x60b5e: that Naomi was lying about her identity, is
0x60b8c: confused and filled with doubt, but heads for
0x60bbc: the underground maintenance base just beyond
0x60beb: the door.
0x60dff: the underground maintenance base and heads
0x60e2c: for the control room.
0x6104c: the control room on the 3rd floor of the
0x610cf: Master repeatedly warns Snake that Naomi is an
0x61100: enemy spy. While filled with doubt, Snake arrives
0x61134: at the underground maintenance base. From
0x61160: Otacon's call, Snake finds out that the new-type
0x61193: nuclear warhead equipped on Metal Gear is a
0x611c1: stealth ballistic missile utilizing a rail gun. Snake
0x611f9: doubts Campbell who kept that fact a secret, but
0x6122c: he heads for the control room on the 3rd floor of
0x61260: the underground maintenance base to stop the
0x6128f: launch of this new-type of nuclear warhead.
0x612fb: Snake finally arrived at the control room on the
0x6132e: 3rd floor of the underground maintenance base,
0x6135f: but the detonation code has already been entered.
0x61393: However, Snake hears from Otacon that he
0x613be: discovered how to use the detonation code
0x613ea: emergency override key. The key is made of shape
0x6141d: memory alloy and changes into 3 shapes according
0x61450: to temperature, each shape matching to the
0x6147d: corresponding terminal in the control room.
0x614ab: But Snake gets shot by Ocelot and drops the
0x614d9: key into the drainage ditch on the first floor
0x6150a: of the underground maintenance base.
0x61719: But Snakes gets shot by Ocelot and drops the key.
0x6174d: Snake looks for the key in the drainage ditch on the
0x61784: first floor of the underground maintenance base.
0x61887: Snake hears from Otacon of how to use the
0x618b3: detonation code emergency override key but gets
0x618e5: shot by Ocelot and drops the key to the bottom
0x61916: floor. Snake looks for the key in the drainage ditch
0x6194d: on the first floor of the underground maintenance
0x61981: base but does not find it there. Master advises the
0x619b7: puzzled Snake that a rat might have swallowed the
0x619eb: key.
0x61b54: floor. Snake finds the key in the drainage ditch on
0x61b8a: the first floor. Snake rushes to the control room
0x61bbe: on the 3rd floor of the underground maintenance
0x61bf0: base to input the first PAL code with the key at
0x61c23: room temperature.
0x61d99: floor. Snake goes down to the first floor of the
0x61dcd: underground maintenance base, collects the key
0x61dfe: from the rat, and rushes to the control room on
0x61e30: the 3rd floor of the underground maintenance base
0x61e64: to input the first PAL code with the key at room
0x61e97: temperature.
0x61ede: The detonation code of the new-type nuclear
0x61f0c: warhead has already been entered. Snake tries
0x61f3c: to use the detonation code emergency override
0x61f6c: key to prevent the launch. The key is made of
0x61f9c: shape memory alloy and changes into 3 shapes
0x61fcb: according to temperature, each shape matching
0x61ffb: the corresponding terminal in the control room.
0x6202d: Snake entered the first PAL code with the key
0x6205d: at room temperature. To enter the 2nd PAL code,
0x6208f: Snake must make the key change to the cold
0x620bc: temperature shape. Snake must find a place to
0x620ec: cool the key.
0x622e5: Snake heads for the warehouse where he fought
0x62315: Raven to change the key to the cold temperature
0x62347: shape.
0x62507: at room temperature. Snake has changed the key
0x62538: to the cold temperature shape and heads for
0x62591: underground maintenance base to input the 2nd
0x625c1: PAL code.
0x62751: Snake has completed inputting the 2nd PAL code.
0x62783: Snake has to warm the key to change it to the
0x627b3: warm temperature shape to input the 3rd PAL
0x627e1: code. Snake heads for a warm place.
0x62a21: code. Snake heads for the blast furnace.
0x62b15: key to prevent the launch. While Snake heads
0x62b44: for the blast furnace to warm the key to the
0x62ba1: code, Master points out that Naomi might have
0x62bd1: used FoxDie, a virus weapon to assassinate
0x62bfe: specific targets. Campbell tells Snake who
0x62c2b: wants to know the truth that Naomi has been
0x62c59: arrested as a spy.
0x62ca9: The detonation code of the new-type of nuclear
0x62cda: warhead has already been entered. Master tells
0x62d0b: Snake, who is trying to use the detonation code
0x62d3d: emergency override key to prevent the launch, of
0x62d70: the existence of the assassination virus weapon
0x62da2: FoxDie and that Naomi might have used it.
0x62dce: Campbell tells the puzzled Snake that Naomi has
0x62e00: been arrested as a spy. Arriving at the blast
0x62e30: furnace, Snake tries to change the key to the
0x62e8e: code.
0x62ff3: Campbell tells Snake that Naomi has been arrested
0x63027: as a spy. Although confused by feelings of doubt,
0x6305b: Snake warms the key at the blast furnace, it
0x6308a: changes to the warm temperature shape, and
0x630b7: heads for the control room on the 3rd floor of the
0x630ec: underground maintenance base to input the 3rd
0x6315d: While heading to input the 3rd PAL code to stop
0x6318f: the launch of the new-type of nuclear warhead,
0x631c0: Snake receives a call from Naomi who has been
0x631f0: arrested as a spy. Naomi confesses that she is
0x63221: the sister of Gray Fox, and that she betrayed
0x63251: Snake as revenge, since Snake caused her brother
0x63284: to be what he is now. When the conversation got
0x632b6: to the subject of whom FoxDie has been used
0x632e4: against, the transmission was cut off. Campbell
0x63316: orders the furious Snake to head to the control
0x63348: room.
0x633bb: arrested as a spy. Naomi confesses that she is the
0x633f0: sister of Gray Fox, and that she betrayed Snake
0x63422: as revenge, since Snake caused her brother to be
0x63455: what he is now. When the conversation got to the
0x63488: subject of whom FoxDie has been used against,
0x634b8: the transmission was cut off. Campbell orders the
0x634ec: furious Snake to head to the control room after
0x6351e: changing the key to the warm temperature shape 
0x63550: in order to stop the launch of the new-type of
0x63581: nuclear warhead.
0x635cf: Snake finally entered the 3rd PAL code. However,
0x63602: the system announced that the nuclear warhead
0x63632: has been activated. Laughing at the confused
0x63661: Snake, Master Miller removes his sunglasses, and
0x63694: reveals himself as Liquid Snake. Liquid used Snake
0x636c9: all this time to have Snake perform the emergency
0x636fd: input of the detonation code to activate the new-
0x63731: type of nuclear warhead. Liquid runs to the cockpit
0x63767: of Metal Gear as it starts to move. Snake goes
0x63798: after him.
0x637e3: Snake has been used by Liquid and entered the
0x63813: detonation code. Snake, mad at the fact that he
0x63845: was used, is told by Liquid of an even more
0x63873: shocking fact. The Pentagon's goal from the
0x638a1: beginning was to assassinate the terrorists, and
0x638d4: others involved with FoxDie, carried by Snake, to
0x63908: hide the facts about the development of Metal
0x63938: Gear. Liquid also tells Snake that they are twins.
0x6396d: While Snake is shocked from what he has been
0x6399c: told, Liquid finally starts controlling Metal
0x639cc: Gear...
0x63a11: Snake himself has entered the detonation code.
0x63a42: Pentagon's goal from the beginning was to
0x63a6e: assassinate the terrorists, and others involved
0x63aa0: with FoxDie, carried by Snake, to hide the facts
0x63ad3: about the development of Metal Gear and that
0x63b02: they are twins.
0x63b43: told Liquid finally starts controlling Metal Gear.
0x63b78: With Gray Fox giving his life to assist him, Snake
0x63bad: successfully destroys Metal Gear but loses
0x63bda: consciousness in the explosion.
0x63c37: Liquid still stands strong in front of Snake who
0x63c6a: successfully destroyed Metal Gear. Liquid has
0x63c9a: been used as sacrifice for the creation of Snake as
0x63cd0: the superior clone of Big Boss. Liquid, with all the
0x63d07: resentment, challenges Snake for a final battle
0x63d39: on top of the destroyed Metal Gear. Meanwhile,
0x63d6a: the Secretary of Defense has ordered an air raid
0x63d9d: of the base. Campbell tried to stop the air raid,
0x63dd1: but is arrested. Liquid activated a time bomb
0x63e01: before the approaching moment of doom.
0x63e2a: The final battle has begun.
0x63eb6: successfully destroyed Metal Gear. Liquid, with
0x63ee8: all the resentment, challenges Snake for a final
0x63f1b: battle on top of Metal Gear. After winning the
0x63f4c: battle, Snake finally rescues Meryl. Bbefore they
0x63f80: have a chance to enjoy the moment, the US Air
0x63fb0: Force air raid starts shaking the base.
0x63fda: Otacon deactivated security along the escape
0x64009: route. Snake and Meryl use the escape route to
0x6403a: attempt to flee from the collapsing underground
0x64147: battle on top the head of the destroyed Metal
0x64177: Gear. Snake wins the battle and gets Meryl back,
0x641aa: but Meryl is already dead. Snake's anguished
0x641d9: scream echoes in the underground base.
0x64202: Snake is now determined to survive for Meryl.
0x64232: The air raid of the US Air Force has begun.
0x64260: Snake and Otacon attempt to escape from the
0x6428e: collapsing underground base.

0x66674: Snake has successfully infiltrated Shadow Moses 
0x666a7: Island. Once Snake reached the surface, he must 
0x666da: find a way to enter the nuclear weapons disposal 
0x6670e: facility. To rescue the DARPA Chief who was taken 
0x66743: hostage, Snake avoids been seen by the enemies' 
0x66776: surveillance and infiltrates deeper into the disposal
0x667ae: facility. 
0x66809: Finding an intruder, enemy soldiers swarm into
0x6683a: the cell. Snake fights back immediately. The female
0x66870: soldier just stands there unable to say a word.
0x668a2: While shooting the enemies, Snake shouts at the 
0x668d5: female soldier. "What are you doing? Shoot! 
0x66905: Don t be afraid!" As if regaining consciousness, 
0x6693a: the female soldier starts firing her FAMAS. 
0x6696a: With her help, the enemies have been wiped out. 
0x6699e: The female soldier then heads for the cell exit.
0x66a2e: The terrorists have already found out the detonation
0x66a65: code from the DARPA Chief. In order to stop the 
0x66a98: nuclear launch, Snake goes to rescue ArmsTech 
0x66ac9: President Kenneth Baker, the person who knows 
0x66afa: the second and final detonation code.
0x66b76: FOX-HOUND member Revolver Ocelot. 
0x66b9c: Snake fights a tough battle against this gun master
0x66bd2: who can even control the ricochet of his shots.
0x66c04: However, Snake drives Ocelot to bay by taking
0x66c34: advantage of the weakpoint of the revolver gun
0x66c65: -- its reloading time. 
0x66cd0: Snake successfully rescues President Baker from 
0x66d03: FOX-HOUND member Revolver Ocelot. However, 
0x66d31: Baker has already given away the detonation code. 
0x66d66: The only thing that can stop the nuclear launch 
0x66d99: now is the detonation code emergency override key 
0x66dce: given to Meryl, or Metal Gear chief engineer 
0x66dfe: Dr. Emmerich. Right after Baker tells this to Snake, 
0x66e36: he dies of a sudden heart attack. Snake tries 
0x66e67: contacting Meryl at the Codec frequency from 
0x66e97: the back of the CD case.
0x66f0c: Now that the terrorists know both detonation codes, 
0x66f43: the only thing that can stop the nuclear launch is 
0x66f79: the detonation code emergency override key given
0x66fac: to Meryl,or Metal Gear chief engineer Dr. Emmerich.
0x66fe2: Snake successfully contacts Meryl, and with her 
0x67016: help, the door at the north of the first floor of the 
0x6704f: tank hangar is now open. To rescue Dr. Emmerich,
0x67082: Snake exits through the cargo entrance and heads 
0x670b6: for the nuclear warhead storage building.
0x6713f: The M1 tank approaches Snake on the snow filled 
0x67172: battlefield. The cannon fires and Vulcan Raven 
0x671a4: mockingly laughs from the top of the tank. 
0x671d2: The tank's cannon will not allow Snake to get close 
0x67209: enough for combat. However, Snake uses Chaff to 
0x6723c: confuse the M1's electronic devices and 
0x67267: approaches the tank. He throws a grenade into 
0x67298: the hatch and successfully destroys the tank.
0x67328: To find out how to stop the nuclear launch, 
0x67357: Snake heads to rescue Metal Gear chief engineer 
0x6738a: Dr. Hal Emmerich. Inside the nuclear warhead 
0x673ba: storage building Snake sees a bunch of enemy 
0x673ea: soldier corpses and a flickering shadow of 
0x67418: stealth camouflage. Sensing Dr. Emmerich's life 
0x6744b: is at risk, Snake runs to the lab at the northeast
0x67480: of the second floor basement of the nuclear 
0x674af: warhead storage building.
0x67515: Wielding a sword, the Cyborg Ninja comes toward 
0x67548: Snake. The Ninja deflects all shots fired by Snake. 
0x6757f: "You cannot hurt me with such weapons!" 
0x675aa: mocks the Ninja, demanding a hand-to-hand duel. 
0x675dd: Snake accepts the offer and engages in 
0x67607: hand-to-hand combat. A violent but pure physical 
0x6763b: battle ensues. In the midst of this fight, the name 
0x67672: of one man comes in the mind of Snake...
0x676fd: Snake successfully rescues Otacon but is shocked
0x67730: when he finds out that the Ninja he just fought is 
0x67766: actually his former war buddy Gray Fox. After Otacon
0x6779d: discovers that Metal Gear, against his will, was 
0x677d1: developed as a nuclear warhead-equipped walking 
0x67804: tank, he offers to cooperate with Snake. 
0x67830: In his search for Meryl to get the detonation code
0x67865: emergency override key from her, Snake sees 
0x67895: Meryl enter the women's bathroom and follows her.
0x67926: Meeting up with Meryl again, Snake gets the 
0x67955: detonation code emergency override key. However, 
0x67989: what she only had one of the three keys. 
0x679b5: In order to stop the nuclear launch, one must 
0x679e6: deactivate the detonation code or destroy Metal 
0x67a19: Gear itself. From the north of the commander's room
0x67a4f: in the first floor basement of the nuclear warhead
0x67a84: storage building, Snake and Meryl head for the
0x67ab5: underground maintenance base where Metal Gear 
0x67ae6: is stored. However, Meryl suddenly starts acting 
0x67b7c: Meryl suddenly starts attacking Snake in the
0x67bab: commander's room. Snake doesn't want to attack 
0x67bdd: Meryl, but Meryl on the other hand, does not 
0x67c0d: hesitate to pull the trigger of her Desert Eagle. 
0x67c42: Learning from Campbell's Codec message that 
0x67c71: Meryl is being brainwashed and controlled by 
0x67ca2: Psycho Mantis, Snake knocks Meryl unconscious. 
0x67cd4: Now unable to control Meryl, Mantis himself finally 
0x67d0b: makes his appearance.
0x67d80: Mantis makes his appearance and Snake fights him. 
0x67db5: However, Mantis dodges all of Snake's attacks as 
0x67de9: if he knew they were coming. Unable to do anything, 
0x67e20: Snake is injured by Mantis' telekinetic attacks. 
0x67e54: From Campbell's Codec message Snake learns that 
0x67e87: Mantis has been reading Snake's mind, and can 
0x67eb8: anticipate Snake's attacks. Snake outsmarts Mantis'
0x67eee: mind-reading abilities and successfully defeats
0x67f20: Mantis.
0x67f87: The defeated Mantis tells Snake that the only
0x67fb7: way to the underground maintenance base is 
0x67fe5: to go north from the commander's room and over
0x68016: the communications tower beyond the cave. Mantis 
0x6804a: then dies. To stop the terrorists' nuclear launch,
0x6807f: one must deactivate the detonation code or destroy
0x68117: is stored. They go through the wolf-dog occupied
0x6814a: cave and get to the underground passage leading
0x6817c: to the communications tower.
0x681f2: Snake and Meryl head for the communications tower
0x68226: -- the only way to the underground maintenance 
0x68258: base. But on the way, Meryl is shot by Sniper Wolf.
0x6828e: Obtaining the PSG1, the only weapon to fight back 
0x682c3: and save Meryl, Snake defeats Wolf in a sniping 
0x682f6: battle. However, Meryl could no longer be found. 
0x6832a: Snake heads north to get hints as to where she 
0x6835d: went. In a blunder,Snake is surrounded by awaiting 
0x68393: enemies.
0x68426: maintenance base to stop the terrorists' nuclear
0x68459: launch. But on the way, Meryl gets shot by Sniper
0x6848d: Wolf and is taken prisoner. Snake is also taken
0x684bf: prisoner when trying to rescue Meryl. Ocelot tells
0x684f4: Snake that if Snake submits to torture, he will kill
0x6852b: Meryl. Snake resists the torture with Meryl's life at
0x68563: stake but then is locked up in a cell.
0x6862c: Now a prisoner, Snake was being tortured by
0x6865a: Ocelot. If he submits, Meryl will be killed. While
0x6868f: resisting the repetitive torture and waiting for the
0x686c6: right timing to escape, Snake receives a Codec
0x686f7: call from Campbell.
0x687a2: Ocelot. If he submits, Meryl will be killed. 
0x687d4: However, Snake was unable to resist Ocelot s 
0x68806: tough torture. Ocelot cold-bloodedly tells Snake 
0x6883a: that he will kill Meryl. While suffering in deep 
0x6886f: regret and waiting for the right timing to escape, 
0x688a5: Snake receives a Codec call from Campbell.
0x68904: Snake resists Ocelot's torture until the very end and
0x6893c: then escapes from the cell. However he had no
0x6896c: idea where the other prisoner Meryl was. To enter
0x689a0: the underground maintenance base by detouring
0x689d0: over the blocking glacier, Snake heads for the
0x68a01: communications tower and gets to the underground
0x68a34: passage. That was where Meryl had been sniped...
0x68ab5: Snake couldn't resist Ocelot's torture and couldn't
0x68aeb: rescue Meryl... After escaping from the cell, 
0x68b1d: Snake heads for the communications tower and 
0x68b4d: gets to the underground passage. He can enter 
0x68bae: over the glacier. That was where Meryl had been 
0x68be2: sniped...
0x68c20: The terrorists have already started preparing for 
0x68c55: the launch of the new-type nuclear warhead.
0x68c83: To stop the launch, one must use the detonation 
0x68cb6: code emergency override key at the underground 
0x68ce8: maintenance base in the north, or destroy Metal 
0x68d1b: Gear itself. Infiltrating the communications tower, 
0x68d52: Snake climbed to the tower roof to detour over 
0x68d84: the glacier blocking the way. But as Snake tries 
0x68db8: to cross the walkway, a sudden missile attack hits 
0x68dee: the huge antenna.
0x68e5c: Liquid's Hind D attacked Snake who was trying
0x68e8c: for the walkway of communications tower A in
0x68ebb: order to detour over the glacier blocking the way
0x68eef: to the underground maintenance base. Dodging
0x68f1e: the Hind's insistent attacks and rappelling down
0x68f51: the wall of communications tower A, Snake obtains
0x68f85: the Stinger missile. To end the battle, Snake heads
0x68fbb: for the roof of communications tower B. On the way,
0x68ff1: he notices a strange existence awaiting him. Snake
0x69026: holds his Socom and jumps around the corner.
0x690af: Snake was attacked by Liquid's Hind D at 
0x690db: communications tower A but rappelled down the
0x6910b: wall and obtained the Stinger, a weapon effective
0x6913f: against the Hind. Snake meets Otacon on his way 
0x69172: to use the elevator. Snake gets to the roof of 
0x691a4: communications tower B to finish the battle with 
0x691d8: Liquid.
0x69230: Snake faces Liquid's Hind D on the roof of commu-
0x69264: nications tower B. The 12.7mm Vulcan cannon shoots
0x69299: at Snake. Snake dodges the firing and shoots his
0x692cc: Stinger at the Hind. Snake fights this tough battle
0x69302: against Russia's heavy battle helicopter and gets
0x69336: injured. But when one of many successful Stinger
0x69369: shots makes a hit, the massive Hind starts falling.
0x69400: Snake fought Liquid's Hind D on the roof of
0x6942e: communications tower B and successfully shoots
0x6945f: it down. Taking a ride down on the elevator of
0x69490: communications tower B, Snake gets to the
0x694bc: snowfield north of tower B. Snake heads for the
0x694ee: entrance of the underground maintenance base
0x6951d: north of this snowfield. He then gets sniped by
0x6954f: someone and cannot advance. That is when Snake
0x69580: gets a Codec call from Otacon.
0x695eb: Snake stands in the snowfield north of the
0x69618: communications tower. There awaited Sniper Wolf.
0x6964b: Snake accepts the challenge of Sniper Wolf.
0x69679: The victor of the tough but quiet sniping battle in
0x696af: the snowfield was again Snake. Convinced that he
0x696e2: won, Snake heads north to infiltrate Metal Gear's
0x69716: underground maintenance base. He then spots
0x69744: Wolf who has fallen onto the snow and runs toward
0x69778: her.
0x697ef: Snake again defeats Sniper Wolf who awaited him 
0x69822: in the snowfield north of the communications tower. 
0x69859: After watching her die along with Otacon, Snake 
0x6988c: successfully goes through the entrance of the 
0x698bd: underground maintenance base. Snake takes the 
0x698ee: cargo elevator and heads for the lower level of 
0x69921: Metal Gear's underground maintenance base. 
0x6994f: He then gets a Codec call from Master Miller.
0x699df: Master Miller tells Snake, who was taking the cargo
0x69a15: elevator to the lower level, that Naomi could be
0x69a48: a spy. Snake does not believe what he hears.
0x69a77: All he can do now is head for the underground
0x69aa7: maintenance base to stop the launch of the new-
0x69ad9: type nuclear warhead. Snake reaches the bottom
0x69b0a: and infiltrates the underground warehouse.
0x69b37: The underground maintenance base is within his
0x69b68: reach.
0x69bbb: The deadly battle between Snake and Vulcan
0x69be8: Raven begins. Snake hides himself among the
0x69c16: containers piled up in the warehouse. Raven starts
0x69c4b: shooting overwhelmingly with his M61 20mm cannon
0x69c7e: and destroys the containers. However, it was once
0x69cb2: again Snake who won this battle in this underground
0x69ce8: warehouse at a temperature below 30 degrees
0x69d16: Celsius. The defeated Raven braces himself against
0x69d4b: the wall to support his strength-depleted body.
0x69dda: Right before his death, the defeated Raven
0x69e07: revealed that the DARPA Chief who died in front of
0x69e3c: Snake was actually FOX-HOUND member Decoy 
0x69e69: Octopus in disguise. Master Miller also tells Snake
0x69e9f: that Naomi is using a false identity. Filled will
0x69ed3: feelings of doubt, Snake heads for the command 
0x69f05: room on the third floor of the underground 
0x69f33: maintenance base. He then gets a Codec call 
0x69f62: from Otacon. 
0x69fcf: Snake learns from Otacon's call that the new-type
0x6a003: of nuclear warhead equipped on Metal Gear is a
0x6a034: stealth ballistic missile utilizing a railgun. While
0x6a06b: suspecting Campbell for hiding this fact, Snake
0x6a09d: heads for the underground maintenance base to
0x6a0cd: stop the launch of this new-type of nuclear warhead
0x6a103: and finally gets to the command room.
0x6a166: Snake finally got to the command room on the 
0x6a196: third floor of the underground maintenance base. 
0x6a1ca: However, the detonation codes have already been 
0x6a1fd: entered. Snake learns from Otacon how to use 
0x6a22d: the detonation code emergency override key, but 
0x6a260: before having a chance to use it, he gets shot by 
0x6a295: Ocelot and drops the key to a lower level. Snake 
0x6a2c9: successfully gets the key in the drainage ditch on 
0x6a2ff: the first floor of the underground maintenance base,
0x6a336: returns to the command room on the third floor, 
0x6a369: and enters the first PAL code with the key's shape
0x6a39e: at room temperature .
0x6a40a: Snake tries to stop the nuclear launch by using the
0x6a440: detonation code emergency override key. The key 
0x6a473: is made of shape memory alloy and changes shape 
0x6a4a6: in three ways according to temperature. The key 
0x6a4d9: at each of the three shapes is to be entered into 
0x6a50e: each matching terminal. Completing entry of the 
0x6a541: PAL code with the room-temperature-shape key, 
0x6a572: Snake changed the key to the cold temperature 
0x6a5a3: shape and entered the second PAL code in the 
0x6a5d3: command room.
0x6a63d: Snake completed the entry of the second PAL 
0x6a66c: code. To enter the third PAL code, Snake has to 
0x6a69f: warm the key to get it into the warm-temperature 
0x6a6d3: shape. When Snake gets on the cargo elevator to 
0x6a706: head to the blast furnace -- the warmest place 
0x6a738: in the base -- he gets a Codec call from 
0x6a764: Master Miller.
0x6a7c3: Master tells Snake, who is trying to stop the nuclear 
0x6a7fc: launch by using the detonation code emergency 
0x6a82d: override key, of the assassination virus weapon 
0x6a860: FoxDie and that Naomi was the one who used it. 
0x6a892: When Snake was unsure of whether or not this 
0x6a8c2: was true, Campbell tells Snake that Naomi was 
0x6a8f3: arrested for spying. Filled with suspicion, 
0x6a922: Snake changes the key to the warm temperature 
0x6a953: shape at the blast furnace, takes the cargo elevator,
0x6a98b: and heads for the command room to enter the third 
0x6a9c0: PAL code. He then gets a Codec call.
0x6aa3e: Naomi has been arrested by Campbell. There is no
0x6aa71: time left until the new-type of nuclear warhead is 
0x6aaa7: launched. While feeling suspicious, Snake gets to 
0x6aadc: the command room of the Metal Gear underground 
0x6ab0e: maintenance base and enters the third PAL code.
0x6ab94: Master Miller was actually Liquid in disguise. Liquid 
0x6abcd: actually had Snake pursue his mission and used 
0x6abff: him in order to have him enter the detonation code
0x6ac34: and deactivate the PAL. After revealing all, Liquid
0x6ac6a: locks Snake in the command room and pumps in 
0x6ac9b: poison gas. But with Otacon's help, Snake managed 
0x6acd0: to escape. Snake sees Liquid from behind, running
0x6ad04: towards the cockpit of Metal Gear. Snake chases 
0x6ad37: after Liquid.
0x6ada4: Metal Gear has finally been activated. Liquid
0x6add4: mocks Snake who can do nothing against the 
0x6ae02: overwhelming fire power of the nuclear-equipped 
0x6ae35: walking tank. Snake gets advice from Metal Gear 
0x6ae68: chief engineer Otacon, that if Snake destroys 
0x6ae99: the "radome", it will disable all sensors and 
0x6aeca: force Liquid to open the cockpit. Snake can then 
0x6aefe: shoot inside the cockpit, and could destroy 
0x6af2d: Metal Gear. Snake shoots his Stinger missile at the 
0x6af64: radome while dodging Metal Gear's overwhelming 
0x6af96: attacks. Metal Gear's massive body finally starts to 
0x6afce: shudder...
0x6b055: Gray Fox has died. But now Metal Gear's radome 
0x6b087: is completely destroyed. Liquid opens the cockpit
0x6b0bb: door and starts attacking like wild to kill Snake.
0x6b0f0: Snake faces this attack and fires his Stinger in 
0x6b124: anger and grief. The Stinger hits the now revealed 
0x6b15a: cockpit. Metal Gear goes down in flames.
0x6b1d6: Snake and Liquid engage in their final battle on 
0x6b20a: top of the head of Metal Gear. The air raid is 
0x6b23c: approaching and the time bomb counter is ticking. 
0x6b271: On goes the very basic fight with no weapons 
0x6b2a1: other than their fists...At the end of the deadly 
0x6b2d6: battle between the two, Snake's finishing blow 
0x6b308: knocks Liquid off the top of Metal Gear.
0x6b382: Trying to escape from the base, Snake and Meryl 
0x6b3b5: hop into a jeep they found in the underground 
0x6b3e6: parking lot and drive down the escape route. After
0x6b41b: breaking through two checkpoints, they noticed one
0x6b450: jeep coming after them. "Snake!It s not over yet!"
0x6b486: It was Liquid chasing them with blood in his eyes. 
0x6b4bc: They shoot at each other from their jeeps. Unable to 
0x6b4f4: outrun Liquid, Snake's jeep crashes into Liquid's at 
0x6b52c: the exit of the escape route...
0x6b5ac: Trying to escape from the base, Snake and Otacon 
0x6b611: parking lot and drive down the escape route. After 
0x6b647: breaking through two checkpoints, they noticed one 
0x6b6b3: It was Liquid chasing them with blood in his eyes.
0x6b6e8: They shoot at each other from their jeeps. Unable to

Real Time
------------------
0x1fc: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island
0x24c: in Alaska's Fox Archipelago
0x278: was attacked and captured by Next-Generation Special Forces
0x2c8: being led by members of FOX-HOUND.
0x2fc: They're demanding that the government turn over the remains of Big Boss
0x358: and they say that if their demands are not met within 24 hours,
0x3ac: they'll launch a nuclear weapon.
0x3e0: You'll have two mission objectives.
0x414: First, you're to rescue DARPA chief, Donald Anderson
0x45c: and the President of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker.
0x49c: Both are being held as hostages.
0x4d0: Secondly,
0x4ec: you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have the ability
0x544: to make a nuclear strike...
0x570: and stop them if they do.
0x59c: What's the insertion method?
0x5cc: We'll approach the disposal facility by sub.
0x60c: And then?
0x628: We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle).
0x670: After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it.
0x6b8: From there on you'll have to swim.

0x64495c: High Tech Special Forces Unit FOX-HOUND.
0x644998: Your former unit...
0x6449bc: ...and one that I was a commander of.
0x6449f4: So they're still around...
0x644a20: There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist activity.
0x644a7c: Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities.
0x644ac4: Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.
0x644b0c: Decoy Octopus, master of disguise.
0x644b40: Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman.

0x7a8120: And Revolver Ocelot,
0x7a8148: specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter.
0x7a8194: And finally, in charge of them... FOX-HOUND's squad leader,
0x7a81e4: Liquid Snake.
0x7a8204: Liquid Snake?
0x7a8224: The man with the same code name as you.
0x7a8260: The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island.
0x7a82b0: I'll instruct you by codec after you reach your target.
0x7a82fc: Anyone going with me?
0x7a8324: As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.
0x7a8368: Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?
0x7a83ac: Yes.
0x7a83c4: This is a top-secret black op.
0x7a83f4: Don't expect any official support.

0xa1f934: There he is!
0xa1f954: Damn!!

0xb2c9ac: Welcome, kasack!!
0xb2c9d0: This is the end of the road for you! Right, my friends?
0xb2ca1c: Listen. They agree.
0xb2ca40: How dare you kill my friends...
0xb2ca70: Ravens aren't scavengers like most people think...
0xb2cab4: They're simply returning to the natural world
0xb2caf4: that which is no longer needed.
0xb2cb24: Sometimes they even attack wounded foxes.
0xb2cb60: You were the one in the M1 tank?
0xb2cb94: Musta been a tight fit for a big boy like you.
0xb2cbd4: Ha ha ha ha ha...
0xb2cbf8: But that was no true battle.
0xb2cc28: The ravens and I were testing to see what kind of man you were.
0xb2cc7c: The judgment is decided.
0xb2cca8: The ravens say you are a true warrior.
0xb2cce0: Am I hallucinating?
0xb2cd04: I...
0xb2cd1c: I can't move...
0xb2cd3c: The Raven has put the mark of death upon you.
0xb2cd7c: Blood from the East flows within your veins.
0xb2cdbc: Ah...
0xb2cdd4: your ancestors too were raised on the barren plains of Mongolia.
0xb2ce28: Inuit and Japanese are cousins to each other...
0xb2ce6c: We share many ancestors, you and I...
0xb2cea4: I don't have any crows in my family tree.
0xb2cee0: You jest, but indeed ravens and snakes are not the best of friends.
0xb2cf38: Nevertheless you will make a worthy adversary.
0xb2cf78: You live in Alaska too.
0xb2cfa0: You know of the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics?
0xb2cfe0: Yeah, I know it.
0xb2d004: You must be a real threat in the "Muktuk Eating" contest.
0xb2d050: Yes, you are right.
0xb2d074: But there is another event that I excel at.
0xb2d0b4: It is called the "Ear Pull."
0xb2d0e4: It is an event where two opponents pull each other's ear
0xb2d130: while enduring the harsh cold.
0xb2d160: It tests spiritual as well as physical strength...
0xb2d1a4: You want to pull each other's ears?

0x1275560: The form is different, but the spirit is the same.
0x12755a4: Rejoice, Snake! Ours will be a glorious battle.
0x12755e8: This isn't glorious. It's just plain killing.
0x1275628: Violence isn't a sport!
0x1275650: Well, we will see if there is iron in your words!!

0x13731ac: Welcome, kasack!!
0x13731d0: This is the end of the road for you! Right, my friends?
0x137321c: Listen. They agree.
0x1373240: Ravens aren't scavengers like most people think...
0x1373284: They're simply returning to the natural world
0x13732c4: that which is no longer needed.
0x13732f4: Sometimes they even attack wounded foxes.
0x1373330: You were the one in the M1 tank?
0x1373364: Musta been a tight fit for a big boy like you.
0x13733a4: Ha ha ha ha ha...
0x13733c8: But that was no true battle.
0x13733f8: The ravens and I were testing to see what kind of man you were.
0x137344c: The judgment is decided.
0x1373478: The ravens say  you are a true warrior.
0x13734b4: Am I hallucinating?
0x13734d8: I...
0x13734f0: I can't move...
0x1373510: The Raven has put the mark of death upon you.
0x1373550: Blood from the East flows within your veins.
0x1373590: Ah...
0x13735a8: your ancestors too were raised on the barren plains of Mongolia.
0x13735fc: Inuit and Japanese are cousins to each other...
0x1373640: We share many ancestors, you and I...
0x1373678: I don't have any crows|in my family tree.
0x13736b4: You jest, but indeed ravens and snakes are not the best of friends.
0x137370c: Nevertheless you will make a worthy adversary.
0x137374c: You live in Alaska too.
0x1373774: You know of the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics?
0x13737b4: Yeah, I know it.
0x13737d8: You must be a real threat in the "Muktuk Eating" contest.
0x1373824: Yes, you are right.
0x1373848: But there is another event that I excel at.

0x1373934: It tests spiritual as well as physical strength...
0x1373978: You want to pull each other's ears?
0x13739ac: The form is different, but the spirit is the same.

0x1a90724: Rejoice, Snake! Ours will be a glorious battle.
0x1a90768: This isn't glorious. It's just plain killing.
0x1a907a8: Violence isn't a sport!
0x1a907d0: Well, we will see if there is iron in your words!!

0x1b55170: Just as the Boss said...
0x1b5519c: It is my existence which is no longer needed in this world.
0x1b551ec: But my body will not remain in this place.
0x1b55228: My spirit and my flesh will become one with the ravens.
0x1b55274: In that way, I will return to Mother Earth who bore me.
0x1b552c0: Snake!
0x1b552d8: I will be watching you... understand?
0x1b55310: Snake,  take this security card.
0x1b55344: It will open that door.
0x1b5536c: Why?
0x1b55384: You are a Snake which was not created by Nature.
0x1b553c8: You and the Boss... you are from another world...
0x1b5540c: a world that I do not wish to know...
0x1b55444: Go and do battle with him...
0x1b55474: I will be watching from above.
0x1b554a4: First I'll give you a hint...
0x1b554d4: The man who you saw die before your eyes...

0x20110f8: That was not the DARPA Chief.
0x2011128: It was Decoy Octopus. A member of FOX-HOUND.
0x2011168: He was a master of disguise...
0x2011198: He copied his subjects down to the blood.
0x20111d4: So he drained the Chief's blood and took it into himself.
0x2011220: But he wasn't able to deceive the Angel of Death.
0x2011264: The Angel of Death?

0x2267184: But why go to so much trouble?
0x22671b4: Why impersonate the Chief?
0x22671e0: That is the end of my hint.
0x226720c: You must solve the rest of the riddle yourself.
0x2267268: In the natural world, there is no such thing as boundless slaughter.
0x22672c0: There is always an end to it.
0x22672f0: But you are different.
0x2267318: What are you trying to say?
0x2267344: The path you walk on has no end.
0x2267378: Each step you take is paved with the corpses of your enemies...
0x22673cc: Their souls will haunt you forever...
0x2267404: you shall have no peace...
0x2267430: Hear me, Snake!
0x2267450: My spirit will be watching you!!

0x26fb15c: Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.
0x26fb1b0: We can launch anytime.
0x26fb1d8: There's still no response from Washington.
0x26fb214: It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business.
0x26fb264: Should I set it for Chernoton, Russia?
0x26fb29c: No, there's been a change. The new target is...Lopnor, China.
0x26fb2ec: Why Boss?
0x26fb308: I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see
0x26fb35c: a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right?
0x26fb3a0: Liquid!
0x26fb3b8: But why? There's nothing there.
0x26fb3e8: Wrong.
0x26fb400: It's a nuclear test site.
0x26fb42c: A nuclear test site?
0x26fb454: If we nuke a major population center, the game's over...
0x26fb4a0: But a nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the public.
0x26fb500: Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China.
0x26fb560: That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries' leaders...
0x26fb5bc: Of course.
0x26fb5d8: And in the process, the President will be forced to divulge the existence
0x26fb634: of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese.
0x26fb688: What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation?
0x26fb6d4: Or the President's?
0x26fb6f8: And with the CTBT, that means that China and India...
0x26fb740: I see...
0x26fb75c: Yes.
0x26fb774: When the other countries hear about this new weapon,
0x26fb7bc: they'll all want to contact us.
0x26fb7ec: Washington won't be very happy
0x26fb81c: when we start selling their own system to the highest bidders.
0x26fb86c: Yes.
0x26fb884: The President will break.
0x26fb8b0: He will give in to our demands.
0x26fb8e0: Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars...
0x26fb91c: one billion dollars!
0x26fb944: That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well.

0x2c5cbd4: I'm also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands.
0x2c5cc1c: FoxDie...
0x2c5cc38: It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president...
0x2c5cc7c: So it's true that it affects older people first.
0x2c5ccc0: Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask.
0x2c5cd10: Wolf wasn't infected either.
0x2c5cd40: Perhaps due to those tranquilizers she always took.
0x2c5cd88: Something to do with the adrenalin level in the blood?
0x2c5cdd0: Or maybe it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental
0x2c5ce20: and they haven't worked out all the bugs yet...
0x2c5ce64: In any case,
0x2c5ce84: have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz?
0x2c5cee4: He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear.
0x2c5cf2c: He said we can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful.
0x2c5cf80: He is a very prudent man.
0x2c5cfac: There's nothing to worry about.
0x2c5cfdc: The Colonel wants Metal Gear
0x2c5d00c: and the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it.
0x2c5d050: If Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower,
0x2c5d0a4: they need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal.
0x2c5d0e4: They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted.
0x2c5d12c: Metal Gear will allow them to gain first strike capability
0x2c5d178: over the rest of the world.
0x2c5d1a4: Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore
0x2c5d1f8: their country's military power with nuclear weapons?
0x2c5d240: Gurlukovich...he's no warrior... he is a politician.
0x2c5d288: But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower.
0x2c5d2e8: He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command.
0x2c5d330: If we joined forces we could put up quite a resistance here.
0x2c5d380: Since Mantis died, the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off.

0x3200030: I'm worried about the men's morale.
0x3200064: An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well...
0x32000b0: What are you saying?
0x32000d8: We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here.
0x3200120: We could still escape...
0x320014c: We've got the most powerful weapon ever made
0x320018c: and we're about to ally with Gurlukovich's forces.
0x32001d0: Are you going to fight the whole world?
0x3200208: And what's wrong with that?
0x3200234: We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet...
0x3200284: A nuclear warhead invisible to radar.
0x32002bc: And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads.
0x3200310: Once we get the DNA and the money,
0x3200344: the world will be ours!
0x320036c: What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich?
0x32003b0: I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia.
0x32003f8: ...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream?
0x3200440: From today,...call this place
0x3200470: "Outer Heaven".
0x3200490: Big Boss's dream...
0x32004b4: But Boss,...
0x32004d4: you're not worried about the PAL being overridden?
0x3200518: If the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated.
0x3200560: No need to worry.
0x3200584: The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are both dead.
0x32005d0: Does Snake know how the override system works?
0x3200610: You interrogated him. Don't you know?
0x3200648: He didn't have any keys on him.
0x3200678: Good.
0x3200690: Then no one can stop Metal Gear now.
0x32006c8: By the way, what should we do with that woman?
0x3200708: Want me to kill her?
0x3200730: Let her live.
0x3200750: She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her...
0x3200794: We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole.
0x32007cc: Meryl...
0x32007e8: she's alive.

0x3741170: Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control Room...
0x37411c8: I see them.
0x37411e4: Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input.
0x3741230: There should be a symbol on each screen...
0x374126c: Each symbol corresponds to a different key.
0x37412ac: Input the keys in order from left to right.
0x37412e8: The left one's for the room temperature key.
0x3741328: See the symbol?
0x3741348: Next to that goes the low temperature key.
0x3741384: The one on the right is the high temperature key.
0x37413c8: Okay, I got it.
0x37413e8: First I change the shape of the card and then I input them in order, right?
0x3741448: That's right. All you do is insert the card keys.
0x374148c: After you insert the key into the module,
0x37414c8: a hard disk reads the information contained on it.
0x374150c: Once you've finished with all three terminals,
0x374154c: the code input process is complete.
0x3741580: But here's the thing.
0x37415a8: You can only use the key three times.
0x37415e0: It's an emergency system and it's only meant to be used once.
0x3741630: The world is riding on that key, Snake.
0x3741668: Who's that!!
0x3741688: Damn!!
0x37416a0: The key fell in the drainage ditch!
0x37416d4: Snake!!
0x37416ec: This is bullet-proof glass!
0x3741718: There's no way in!
0x374173c: I'll enjoy watching you die!
0x374176c: Snake, you've got to get that key!

0x3c319c0: PAL code number one confirmed.
0x3c319f0: Awaiting PAL code number two...
0x3c31a20: Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one...
0x3c31a64: Now PAL number two...
0x3c31a8c: freeze the key.

0x3dac1c0: PAL code number two confirmed.
0x3dac1f0: Awaiting PAL code number three...
0x3dac224: Okay, there goes PAL code number two.
0x3dac25c: Next comes PAL number three...
0x3dac28c: warm the key.

0x3f2b1fc: PAL code number three confirmed.
0x3f2b230: PAL code entry complete...
0x3f2b25c: Detonation code activated.
0x3f2b288: No! Why!
0x3f2b2a4: Ready for launch...
0x3f2b2c8: I deactivated it!!

0x409f8bc: Liquid!!
0x409f8d8: Snake, did you like my sunglasses?
0x409f90c: You'd point a weapon at your own brother?
0x409f948: Why did you disguise yourself as Master?
0x409f984: So I could manipulate you more easily.
0x409f9bc: And you performed quite well, I must say.
0x409fa0c: Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying the same thing...
0x409fa68: What the hell are you talking about!?
0x409faa0: Following orders blindly with no questions asked.
0x409fae4: You've lost your warrior's pride and
0x409fb1c: become nothing more than a pawn, Snake.
0x409fb58: What?
0x409fb70: Stopping the nuclear launch, rescuing the hostages...
0x409fbb8: It was all just a diversion.
0x409fbe8: A diversion?
0x409fc08: The Pentagon only needed for you to come into contact with us.
0x409fc58: That's what killed the ArmsTech president
0x409fc94: and Decoy Octopus.
0x409fcb8: You don't mean...
0x409fcdc: That's right.
0x409fcfc: You were sent in here to kill us
0x409fd30: so they could retrieve Metal Gear undamaged
0x409fd70: along with the bodies of the genome soldiers.
0x409fdb0: From the beginning, the Pentagon was just
0x409fdec: using you as a vector to spread FoxDie!
0x409fe28: Fox Die! ...It can't be!
0x409fe54: Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?
0x409fea0: They thought she was.
0x409fec8: But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so easily.
0x409ff20: What?
0x409ff38: We've got a spy working in the Pentagon.
0x409ff74: He reported that Dr. Hunter altered
0x409ffa8: FoxDie's program just before the operation.
0x409ffe8: But...no one knows how or why.
0x40a0018: I wonder... maybe they arrested her so they could find out the answer to that.
0x40a0078: No doubt.
0x40a0094: But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty revenge...

0x451bdf4: we still don't know what changes she made to FoxDie's program.
0x451be44: Oh well. It doesn't matter.
0x451be70: I've already added the FoxDie vaccine to my list of White House demands.
0x451becc: There's a vaccine?
0x451bef0: There must be.
0x451bf10: But that woman is the only one who really knows.

0x45e1a38: Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary.
0x45e1a74: Why is that?
0x45e1a94: You were successful in coming into contact with all of us,
0x45e1ae0: so we must have all been exposed to the virus.
0x45e1b20: It's true that the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus
0x45e1b6c: were killed by FoxDie...
0x45e1b98: But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier,
0x45e1bd4: were apparently unaffected.
0x45e1c00: A bug in the virus' programming?
0x45e1c34: Hmm, could be.
0x45e1c54: In any case, if it doesn't kill you then I'm not worried either.
0x45e1ca8: After all, our genetic code is identical.
0x45e1ce4: So it's true...you and I are...
0x45e1d14: Yes, twins,
0x45e1d30: but we're not ordinary twins... we're twins linked by cursed genes.
0x45e1d88: Les enfants terribles.
0x45e1db0: You're fine.
0x45e1dd0: You got all the old man's dominant genes.
0x45e1e0c: I got all the flawed, recessive genes.
0x45e1e44: Everything was done so that
0x45e1e70: you would be the greatest of his children.
0x45e1eac: The only reason I exist
0x45e1ed4: is so they could create you.
0x45e1f04: I was the favorite, huh.
0x45e1f30: That's right!
0x45e1f50: I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you.
0x45e1f98: Can you understand what it's like to know
0x45e1fd4: that you're garbage since the day you were born!?
0x45e2018: But...I'm the one father chose.
0x45e2048: ...So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss.
0x45e208c: Some warped kind of love.
0x45e20b8: Love!?
0x45e20d0: It's hate!!
0x45e20ec: He always told me I was inferior
0x45e2120: and now I'll have my revenge!!
0x45e2150: You should understand me, brother.
0x45e2184: You killed our father with your own hands!
0x45e21c0: You stole my chance for revenge!
0x45e21f4: Now I'll finish the work that father began.
0x45e2234: I will surpass him...

0x4c7db54: I will destroy him!
0x4c7db78: You're just like Naomi.
0x4c7dba0: Well I'm not like you.
0x4c7dbc8: Unlike you,
0x4c7dbe4: I'm proud of the destiny that is encoded into my very genes.
0x4c7dc34: Yeah!
0x4c7dc4c: Damn!!
0x4c7dc64: Snake!
0x4c7dc7c: Your blood will be the first to be spilt
0x4c7dcb8: by this glorious new weapon.
0x4c7dce8: Consider it an honor...
0x4c7dd10: a gift from your brother.
0x4c7dd3c: Now, I'll show you!
0x4c7dd60: The power of the weapon that will lead us 
0x4c7dd9c: in the 21st century!
0x4c7ddc4: It's moving...
0x4c7dde4: How do I stop it?

0x51c5238: Did that do it!?
0x51c525c: Damn!!!
0x51c5274: Nice try, Snake!
0x51c5298: Die!!
0x51c52b0: Hurry!
0x51c52c8: Get away!
0x51c52e4: Gray Fox!!
0x51c5300: A name from long ago.
0x51c5328: It sounds better than Deepthroat.
0x51c535c: So it is you!?
0x51c537c: You look terrible, Snake.
0x51c53a8: You haven't aged well.
0x51c53d0: I'll send you back to hell!
0x51c53fc: Fox, why!?
0x51c5418: What do you want from me!?
0x51c5444: I'm a prisoner of Death.
0x51c5470: Only you can free me...
0x51c5498: Fox, stay out of this...
0x51c54c4: What about Naomi?
0x51c54e8: She's hell bent on taking revenge for you.
0x51c5524: Naomi...
0x51c5540: You're the only one who can stop her.
0x51c5578: No...I can't.
0x51c5598: Why?
0x51c55b0: Because I'm the one who killed her parents.
0x51c55f0: I was young then and couldn't bring myself to kill her too.
0x51c5640: I felt so bad that I decided to take her with me.
0x51c5684: I raised her like she was my own blood
0x51c56bc: to soothe my guilty conscience.
0x51c56ec: Even now she thinks of me as her brother...
0x51c572c: Fox...
0x51c5744: From the outside,
0x51c5768: we might have seemed like a happy brother and sister.
0x51c57b0: But every time I looked at her,
0x51c57e0: I saw her parents' eyes staring back at me...
0x51c5820: Tell her for me.
0x51c5844: Tell her that I was the one who did it.
0x51c5880: There you are!
0x51c58a0: We're just about out of time.
0x51c58d0: Here's a final present from Deepthroat.
0x51c590c: I'll stop it from moving!
0x51c5938: Fox!
0x51c5950: In the Middle East,
0x51c5974: we don't hunt foxes, we hunt jackals.
0x51c59ac: Instead of foxhounds, we use royal harriers.
0x51c59ec: Fox!
0x51c5a04: How strong is that exoskeleton of yours?

0x5cdab3c: Snake,
0x5cdab54: are you just going to sit by and watch him die?
0x5cdab98: A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal!
0x5cdabdc: He destroyed the radome...
0x5cdac08: Impressive.
0x5cdac24: You are indeed worthy of the codename "Fox"!
0x5cdac64: But now you're finished!
0x5cdac90: Uuunnggh!! .....Now!
0x5cdacb8: Fire the Stinger!
0x5cdacdc: Fox!
0x5cdacf4: Can you really shoot?
0x5cdad1c: You'll kill him too!

0x5f22984: Die!
0x5f2299c: Snake,
0x5f229b4: we're not tools of the government
0x5f229e8: or anyone else!
0x5f22a08: Fighting was the only thing...
0x5f22a38: the only thing I was good at,
0x5f22a68: but...
0x5f22a80: At least I always fought for what I believed in...
0x5f22ac4: Snake...
0x5f22ae0: farewell.
0x5f22afc: Fooooooox!!!
0x5f22b1c: Foolish man.
0x5f22b3c: He prayed for death... and it found him.
0x5f22b78: You see?
0x5f22b94: You can't protect anyone!!
0x5f22bc0: Not even yourself!
0x5f22be4: Die!!

0x630d970: Snake,
0x630d988: I'll crush you into dust!
0x630d9c8: Ooooh!
0x630d9e0: Uuuuff!

0x66100a8: Les enfants terribles... the terrible children.
0x66100ec: That's what the project was called.
0x6610120: It started in the 1970's.
0x661014c: Their plan was to artificially create the most powerful soldier possible.
0x66101a8: The person that they chose as the model
0x66101e4: was the man known then as the greatest living soldier in the world...
0x661023c: Big Boss...
0x6610258: But father was wounded in combat and already in a coma
0x66102a0: when they brought him in.
0x66102cc: So they created us from his cells...
0x6610304: with a combination of 20th century analog cloning
0x6610348: and the Super Baby Method.
0x6610374: Super Baby Method?
0x6610398: They fertilized an egg with one of father's cells,
0x66103dc: and then let it divide into eight clone babies.
0x6610420: Then they transferred the clones to someone's uterus and
0x661046c: later intentionally aborted six of the fetuses
0x66104ac: to encourage strong fetal growth...
0x66104e0: You and I were originally octuplets.
0x6610518: Octuplets...
0x6610538: Yes.
0x6610550: The other six of our brothers were sacrificed to make us.
0x661059c: We were accomplices in murder before the day we were even born.
0x66105f0: So it was you and I.
0x6610618: Two fertilized eggs with exactly the same DNA.
0x6610658: But...
0x6610670: they weren't finished yet.
0x661069c: They used me as a guinea pig!
0x66106cc: To create a phenotype in which
0x66106fc: all of the dominant genes were expressed....
0x661073c: to create you.
0x661075c: I got all of the recessive genes!
0x6610790: .......
0x66107a8: You took everything from me before I was even born!
0x66107f0: But...
0x6610808: you and I aren't his only children.
0x661083c: What?
0x6610854: The Genome Soldiers.
0x661087c: They too are his progeny, carrying on his genetic legacy.

0x6ab1188: But they're different.
0x6ab11b0: They're digital.
0x6ab11d4: With the completion of the Human Genome project
0x6ab1218: the mysteries of humanity were laid bare...

0x6b380a8: The Genome Soldiers!?
0x6b380d0: That's right.
0x6b380f0: They are our brothers,
0x6b38118: created artificially through the alignment of nucleotides 
0x6b38164: to mimic our father's genes.
0x6b38194: They too are the product of numerous sacrifices.
0x6b381d8: Sacrifices?
0x6b381f4: Human experiments.

0x6bfb0a8: Have you ever heard of the Asymmetry Theory?
0x6bfb0fc: Nature tends to favor asymmetry.
0x6bfb130: Those species which have gone extinct all show signs of symmetry.
0x6bfb184: The Genome Soldiers suffer from the same problem...
0x6bfb1cc: signs of symmetry.
0x6bfb1f0: So do I,
0x6bfb20c: as do you.
0x6bfb228: !!!
0x6bfb23c: That's right.
0x6bfb25c: We are all on the verge of death at the genetic level.
0x6bfb2a4: We don't know when or what type|of disease will occur.
0x6bfb2ec: That's why we need the old man's genetic information.
0x6bfb334: You want Big Boss's DNA so you can save your family?
0x6bfb37c: It's very touching.
0x6bfb3a0: In Nature,
0x6bfb3bc: family members don't  mate with each other.
0x6bfb3fc: And yet they help each other to survive.
0x6bfb438: Do you know why?
0x6bfb45c: It increases the chance that their genes will be passed on to a new generation.
0x6bfb4c0: Altruism among blood relatives is a response to natural selection.
0x6bfb514: It's called the Selfish Gene Theory.
0x6bfb54c: You're telling me that your genes are ordering you
0x6bfb590: to save the Genome Soldiers?
0x6bfb5c0: You can't fight your genes.
0x6bfb5ec: It's fate.
0x6bfb608: All living things are born for the sole purpose of
0x6bfb64c: passing on their parents' genes.
0x6bfb680: That's why I'll follow what my genes tell me.
0x6bfb6c0: And then I'm going to go beyond.
0x6bfb6f4: In order to break the curse of my heritage.
0x6bfb734: And to do that..
0x6bfb758: first I will kill you.

0x703b0d0: Look behind you!
0x703b0f4: Meryl!?
0x703b10c: Is she alive?
0x703b12c: I'm not sure.
0x703b14c: She was alive a few hours ago.
0x703b17c: Poor girl kept calling your name.
0x703b1b0: Meryl...
0x703b1cc: Stupid woman.
0x703b1ec: Falling in love with a man who doesn't even have a name...
0x703b238: I have a name!
0x703b258: No!
0x703b26c: We have no past, no future.
0x703b298: And even if we did, it wouldn't be truly ours.
0x703b2d8: You and I are just copies of our father, Big Boss.
0x703b31c: Let Meryl go!
0x703b33c: As soon as we finished our business.
0x703b374: We're almost out of time.
0x703b3a0: ...You're talking about FoxDie?
0x703b3d0: No.
0x703b3e4: It seems now that the Pentagon knows that Metal Gear is destroyed,
0x703b438: they've arrived at a decision.
0x703b468: They won't even need a BDA (battle damage assessment).
0x703b4b0: If you want the details
0x703b4d8: why don't you ask your precious Colonel Campbell?

0x72d98d0: There's no way out for us.
0x72d98fc: Let's finish this before the air strike.
0x72d9938: You stole everything from me.
0x72d9968: Only your death can satisfy me.
0x72d9998: Only your death can return to me what is rightly mine.
0x72d99e0: She'll make a beautiful sacrifice for our final battle.
0x72d9a2c: Do you see this?
0x72d9a50: It will be the time limit for our final battle.
0x72d9a94: This nuclear module is set to detonate at the precise moment of her death.

0x75378bc: Snaaaaaaaaake!!!

0x757690c: Meryl?
0x7576924: ...Meryl?
0x7576940: Meryyyyyyyyl!!
0x7576960: ...Forgive me.
0x7576980: Damn!
0x7576998: I gave in to my fear!
0x75769c0: I gave in to my pain!
0x75769e8: I sold your life to save my own...
0x7576a1c: I'm a loser.
0x7576a3c: I'm not the hero you thought I was!
0x7576a74: ...I'm nothing!!!
0x7576a98: Meryl, I'm sorry!
0x7576abc: Forgive me!
0x7576ad8: Meryl can't forgive anyone anymore.
0x7576b10: Otacon?
0x7576b28: She's gone, Snake...
0x7576b50: ...Because of me...
0x7576b74: I guess blaming yourself makes it easier, huh.
0x7576bb4: If you do that,
0x7576bd4: you can keep the pain at a nice, safe distance.
0x7576c18: What the hell do you know!
0x7576c44: Meryl's dead!
0x7576c64: I lost!
0x7576c7c: So...
0x7576c94: are you gonna stay here and die?
0x7576cc8: Along with her?
0x7576ce8: Snake...
0x7576d04: people die.
0x7576d20: But death is not defeat.
0x7576d4c: That's what Hemingway said.
0x7576d78: I lost Wolf too.
0x7576d9c: But that wasn't defeat.
0x7576dc4: She and I will be together forever.
0x7576df8: We didn't lose anything.
0x7576e24: Together forever?
0x7576e48: It's true that Wolf is dead,
0x7576e78: but our love didn't die with her...
0x7576eac: Life's more than just a game of win or lose.
0x7576eec: Don't you think?
0x7576f10: Let's live, Snake.
0x7576f34: There's a parking garage right next door.
0x7576f70: We can get to the surface from there.
0x7576fa8: C'mon.
0x7576fc0: I released all the security locks.
0x7576ff4: It'll be okay.
0x7577014:  We can escape...
0x7577038: You have my word on it.
0x7577060: Otacon...
0x757707c: you've changed.
0x757709c: I'm through regretting the past...
0x75770d0: Life isn't all about loss, y'know.
0x7577104: It's started.

0x7ef5ba0: Those guys...
0x7ef5bc0: seems like they only hurry when they're destroying things.
0x7ef5c0c: Good...
0x7ef5c24: Let 'em destroy it.
0x7ef5c48: But they can't destroy the human spirit.
0x7ef5c84: Okay.
0x7ef5c9c: Let's go!
0x7ef5cb8: Meryl...
0x7ef5cd4: I hope you're still watching me...
0x7ef5d08: Maybe I can prove myself to you after all...
0x7ef5d48: Come on, hustle!
0x7ef5d6c: Snake, it's cold outside.
0x7ef5d98: You'll freeze like that.
0x7ef5dc4: My Sneaking Suit!
0x7ef5de8: You better hurry...
0x7ef5e0c: Hurry!
0x7ef5e24: Now you look like yourself again.

0x83710a0: Meryl?
0x83710b8: Meryl!?
0x83710d0: Uh,
0x83710e4: Uh,
0x83710f8: uhnnn...
0x8371114: Snake?
0x837112c: Is that you?
0x837114c: Snake! You're alive!
0x8371174: Thank God!
0x8371190: Meryl?
0x83711a8: Meryl, are you okay?
0x83711d0: Are you okay... Is that all you can say?
0x837120c: Meryl,
0x8371224: it must have been terrible...
0x8371254: It wasn't that bad.
0x8371278: I didn't give in to the torture.
0x83712ac: Torture?
0x83712c8: ...And things even worse than that...
0x8371300: I was fighting too.
0x8371324: Just like you.
0x8371344: You're a strong woman.
0x837136c: Fighting them... made me feel closer to you.
0x83713ac: I felt like you were there with me.
0x83713e4: It gave me the strength to go on.
0x8371418: But I was scared.
0x837143c: ...I'm sorry.
0x837145c: Don't say that...
0x8371480: But it made me realize something.
0x83714b4: During all the pain and shame
0x83714e4: there was one thing I was sure of...
0x837151c: a single hope that I held onto...
0x8371550: And that hope kept me alive...
0x8371580: Snake,
0x8371598: I wanted
0x83715b4: to see you again...
0x83715d8: Meryl...
0x83715f4: !!!
0x8371608: ...That's my codec.

0x87d2120: Let's get the hell out of here.
0x87d2150: ...What about him...?
0x87d2178: Where is Otacon!?
0x87d219c: He's...
0x87d21b4: He's...
0x87d21cc: fighting right now...
0x87d21f4: With his old self...
0x87d221c: to be the man he wants to be.
0x87d224c: He's fighting for us too?
0x87d2278: Yeah,
0x87d2290: and I don't want it to be in vain.
0x87d22c4: ...Me too.
0x87d22e0: Meryl.
0x87d22f8: ...Snake.
0x87d2314: Meryl.
0x87d232c: It's started...
0x87d234c: I must be heavy...
0x87d2370: It looks like we're not gonna have a love scene after all.
0x87d23bc: Looks that way.
0x87d23dc: Too bad...
0x87d23f8: Let's get out of here!
0x87d2420: Snake, it's freezing outside.
0x87d2450: You need some clothes.
0x87d2478: There's my Sneaking Suit!
0x87d24a4: Hurry up.
0x87d24c0: Hurry!
0x87d24d8: Hmm...
0x87d24f0: Looking good, Snake.

0x8cad934: Meryl,
0x8cad94c: are you okay?
0x8cad96c: ...Yeah, just a little shook up.
0x8cad9a0: Meryl, can you move?
0x8cad9c8: It's no good.
0x8cad9e8: I can't move.
0x8cada08: What happened to Liquid?
0x8cada34: I can't see him either...
0x8cada60: Liquid is dead...
0x8cada84: Uh oh!
0x8cada9c: Snake!
0x8cadab4: ...Snaaaake...
0x8cadad4: Fo...
0x8cadaec: ...Fox...?
0x8cadb08: Die...
0x8cadb20: If he's dead, that means...
0x8cadb4c: Don't say it, Snake.
0x8cadb74: What happened to the air raid?
0x8cadba4: No Stealth bombers in sight.

0x92a3134: Otacon,
0x92a314c: are you okay?
0x92a316c: ...I guess so.
0x92a318c: Otacon, can you move?
0x92a31b4: ...It's no use.
0x92a31d4: I can't move.
0x92a31f4: What happened to Liquid?
0x92a3220: I don't know,
0x92a3240: but I hope he's dead.
0x92a3268: Liquid is dead...
0x92a328c: Uh oh!
0x92a32a4: Snake!
0x92a32bc: ...Snaaaake...
0x92a32dc: Fo...
0x92a32f4: ...Fox...?
0x92a3310: Die...
0x92a3328: If he's dead, that means...
0x92a3354: Don't think about it, Snake.
0x92a3384: What happened to the air raid?
0x92a33b4: No Stealth bombers in sight.

0x98978d0: Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic code...
0x989792c: it's unchangeable, immutable...
0x989795c: But that's not all there is to life.
0x9897994: I finally realized that.
0x98979c0: I told you before.
0x98979e4: The reason that I was interested in genes and DNA.
0x9897a28: Because I wanted to know who I was...
0x9897a60: where I came from.
0x9897a84: I thought that if I analyzed my DNA I could find out who I was,
0x9897ad8: who my parents were.
0x9897b00: And I thought that if I knew that,
0x9897b34: then I'd know what path I should take in life.
0x9897b74: But I was wrong.
0x9897b98: I didn't find anything.
0x9897bc0: I didn't learn anything.
0x9897bec: Just like with the Genome Soldiers...
0x9897c24: you can input all the genetic information, but
0x9897c64: that doesn't make them into the strongest soldiers.
0x9897cac: The most we can say about DNA is that
0x9897ce4: it governs a person's potential strengths...
0x9897d24: potential destiny.
0x9897d48: You mustn't allow yourself to be chained to fate...
0x9897d90: to be ruled by your genes.
0x9897dbc: Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.
0x9897e04: Snake,
0x9897e1c: whether or not you're in the FoxDie program isn't important.
0x9897e6c: The important thing is that you choose life...
0x9897eac: And then live!
0x9897ecc: Don't you think, Snake?
0x9897ef4: Don't worry.
0x9897f14: I'm going to choose life too.
0x9897f44: Until today, I've always looked for a reason to live.
0x9897f8c: But from here on,
0x9897fb0: I'm going to just live.

0x9e008f8: Genes exist to pass down our hopes and dreams
0x9e00938: for the future through our children.
0x9e00970: Living is a link to the future.
0x9e009a0: That's how all life works.
0x9e009cc: Loving each other,
0x9e009f0: teaching each other...
0x9e00a18: that's how we can change the world.
0x9e00a50: I finally realized it.
0x9e00a78: The true meaning of life...
0x9e00aa4: Thank you, Snake.

0x9ffe0d0: Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic code...
0x9ffe12c: it's unchangeable, immutable...
0x9ffe15c: But that's not all there is to life.
0x9ffe194: I finally realized that.
0x9ffe1c0: I told you before.
0x9ffe1e4: The reason that I was interested in genes and DNA.

0x9ffe300: And I thought that if I knew that,

0x9ffe374: But I was wrong.
0x9ffe398: I didn't find anything.
0x9ffe3c0: I didn't learn anything.
0x9ffe3ec: Just like with the Genome Soldiers...
0x9ffe424: you can input all the genetic information, but
0x9ffe464: that doesn't make them into the strongest soldiers.
0x9ffe4ac: The most we can say about DNA is that
0x9ffe4e4: it governs a person's potential strengths...
0x9ffe524: potential destiny.

0x9ffe590: to be ruled by your genes.
0x9ffe5bc: Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.
0x9ffe604: Snake,
0x9ffe61c: whether or not you're in the FoxDie program isn't important.
0x9ffe66c: The important thing is that you choose life...
0x9ffe6ac: And then live!
0x9ffe6cc: Don't you think, Snake?
0x9ffe6f4: Don't worry.
0x9ffe714: I'm going to choose life too.
0x9ffe744: Until today, I've always looked for a reason to live.
0x9ffe78c: But from here on,
0x9ffe7b0: I'm going to just live.

0xa5668e4: Genes exist to pass down our hopes and dreams

0xa566a3c: I finally realized it.
0xa566a64: The true meaning of life...
0xa566a90: Thank you, Snake.

0xa75d948: Look.
0xa75d960: I found this.
0xa75d980: Let's keep it.
0xa75d9a0: As a reminder.
0xa75d9c0: Of what?
0xa75d9dc: A reminder of a successful mission or the first time we met?
0xa75da2c: A reminder of how to live.
0xa75da6c: Until today, I've lived only for myself.
0xa75daa8: Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.
0xa75daf4: That's not just you.
0xa75db1c: That's how everyone is.
0xa75db44: I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face.
0xa75db94: I don't know,
0xa75dbb4: maybe it's written into my genes.
0xa75dbe8: What about now?
0xa75dc08: What do your genes say about your future now?
0xa75dc48: Maybe it's time I live for someone else.
0xa75dc84: Someone else?
0xa75dca4: Yeah.
0xa75dcbc: Someone like you...
0xa75dce0: Maybe that's the real way to live.
0xa75dd14: So...where to, Snake?
0xa75dd3c: David.
0xa75dd54: My name is David...
0xa75dd78: Okay, so where to, Dave?
0xa75dda4: Hmmm.
0xa75ddbc: I think it's time we look for a new path in life.
0xa75de00: A new path?
0xa75de1c: A new purpose.
0xa75de3c: Will we find it?
0xa75de60: We'll find it.
0xa75de80: I know we'll find it.
0xa75dea8: What are those?
0xa75dec8: Caribou.
0xa75dee4: To the Aleutians, the caribou is a symbol of life.
0xa75df28: It'll be spring here soon...
0xa75df58: For us too...
0xa75df78: Yeah.
0xa75df90: Spring brings new life to everything.
0xa75dfc8: It's a time for hope.
0xa75dff0: I've lived here a long time...
0xa75e020: But Alaska has never looked more beautiful.
0xa75e060: The sky...
0xa75e07c: the sea...
0xa75e098: the caribou...
0xa75e0b8: and most of all...
0xa75e0dc: You...
0xa75e0f4: I think I'm gonna like this new life...
0xa75e12c: C'mon.
0xa75e144: Let's enjoy life...

0xaffa10c: Until today, I've lived only for myself.
0xaffa148: Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.
0xaffa194: That's not just you.
0xaffa1bc: That's how everyone is.
0xaffa1e4: I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face.
0xaffa234: I don't know,
0xaffa254: maybe it's written into my genes.
0xaffa288: What about now?
0xaffa2a8: I want to enjoy life.
0xaffa2d0: I really do.
0xaffa2f0: How about you, Otacon?
0xaffa318: Me?
0xaffa32c: I feel like a new man.
0xaffa354: So what are you going to do?
0xaffa384: Continue your research?
0xaffa3ac: No, I'm finished with science...
0xaffa3e0: I'm interested in human psychology now.
0xaffa41c: Sounds good...
0xaffa43c: The whole reason I got into science in the first place
0xaffa484: was cause I was no good with people.
0xaffa4bc: I was scared of them.
0xaffa4e4: I was scared of life.
0xaffa50c: I thought that I could never understand them
0xaffa54c: cause they're so illogical.
0xaffa578: But I've finally learned how to like people.
0xaffa5b8: I'm not afraid anymore.
0xaffa5e0: You and I are more alike than I thought...
0xaffa61c: I'm just tired of always being a spectator in life.
0xaffa664: I'm ready to live.
0xaffa688: I'm gonna stand on my own two feet.
0xaffa6c0: I'm not gonna hide anymore.
0xaffa6ec: You're giving up your stealth camo?
0xaffa720: Huh?
0xaffa738: Oh yeah...
0xaffa754: You can have it.
0xaffa778: ...So,
0xaffa790: this is where we say goodbye to our loves as well...
0xaffa7d8: Want me to drive?
0xaffa7fc: No thanks.
0xaffa818: I'd rather do it myself.
0xaffa844: No problem.
0xaffa860: Where to, Snake?
0xaffa884: My real name is David, Otacon.
0xaffa8b4: I'm Hal, Dave.
0xaffa8d4: Oh, that's right...
0xaffa8f8: Hal.

0xb6d0ef4: Hal and Dave?
0xb6d0f14: That's a good one.
0xb6d0f38: Ha ha ha ha ha...
0xb6d0f5c: Maybe we should take a trip to Jupiter...
0xb6d0f98: So where are you going, Dave?
0xb6d0fc8: Hmmm.
0xb6d0fe0: I think it's time for me to look for a new path in life.
0xb6d102c: A new path?
0xb6d1048: A new purpose.
0xb6d1068: Will you find it?
0xb6d108c: I'll find it.
0xb6d10ac: I know I'll find it.

0x39f0: It's been a long time, Snake.
0x3a20: I should have known you were behind this, Colonel.
0x3a64: That's no way to greet an old war buddy, Snake.
0x3aa8: What do you want from me?
0x3ad4: I just invited you here so we could have a talk.
0x3b18: Invited!?
0x3b34: That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me?
0x3b7c: Sorry if they were a little rough with you.
0x3bbc: But we've got a serious situation here.
0x3bf8: Only you can get us out of it.
0x3c28: I'm retired from FOX-HOUND.
0x3c54: You're not my commander anymore
0x3c84: and I don't have to take orders from you or anyone else.
0x3cd0: You will take these orders.
0x3cfc: I know it.
0x3d18: Excuse me...
0x3d38: Who's this?
0x3d54: Dr. Naomi Hunter.
0x3d78: She's chief of FOX-HOUND's medical staff
0x3db4: and an expert in gene therapy.
0x3de4: Are you military?
0x3e08: No, civilian.
0x3e28: I've been sent here from ATGC.
0x3e58: Pleasure to meet you, Snake.
0x3e88: Don't worry,
0x3ea8: this injection won't hurt a bit.
0x3edc: What's the shot for?
0x3f04: What's wrong?
0x3f24: You don't like shots?
0x3f4c: Snake, listen up.
0x3f70: It all went down five hours ago.
0x3fa4: Heavily armed soldiers occupied Shadow Moses Island,
0x3fec: a remote island off the coast of Alaska.
0x4028: What soldiers?
0x4048: Next-Generation Special Forces
0x4078: led by members of Unit FOX-HOUND.
0x40ac: They've presented Washington with a single demand
0x40f0: and they say that if it isn't met,
0x4124: they'll launch a nuclear weapon.
0x4158: A nuclear weapon?
0x417c: I'm afraid so.
0x419c: You see, the island is the site of
0x41d0: a secret nuclear weapons disposal facility.

0x158558: FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon!?
0x158590: Now you understand how serious the situation is.
0x1585d4: You'll have two mission objectives.
0x158608: First you're to rescue the DARPA Chief Donald Anderson
0x158650: and the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker.
0x158690: They're both being held as hostages.
0x1586c8: Those are some heavy duty hostages.
0x158700: Secondly,
0x15871c: you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have
0x158768: the ability to launch a nuclear strike
0x1587a0: and stop them if they do.
0x1587cc: Any questions, Snake?
0x1587f4: Questions?
0x158810: I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission.
0x158858: Well, you can make up your mind
0x158888: after you hear more about the situation.

0x1e4918: Tell me about the nuclear weapon disposal facility.
0x1e4960: The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base.
0x1e49b0: Even with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment
0x1e4a00: we can't tell what's happening inside.
0x1e4a38: So someone needs to penetrate,
0x1e4a68: gather intelligence and report back.
0x1e4aa0: Sounds like a spy movie...
0x1e4acc: What's the insertion method?
0x1e4afc: Well, an air insertion is impossible.
0x1e4b34: Not with this storm going on.
0x1e4b64: We'll approach the disposal facility by sub.
0x1e4ba4: Approach?
0x1e4bc0: Yes,
0x1e4bd8: within a few miles of it.
0x1e4c04: The facility is equipped with sonar detection capabilities.
0x1e4c54: They'd be able to hear our engine or propeller noise.
0x1e4c9c: And then?
0x1e4cb8: We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle).
0x1e4d00: Launch?
0x1e4d18: Same as a torpedo.
0x1e4d3c: Only this has no propulsion device of its own.
0x1e4d7c: After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it.
0x1e4dc4: From there on you'll have to swim.
0x1e4df8: You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water?
0x1e4e38: Don't worry.
0x1e4e58: That suit represents the latest advances in poly-thermal technology.
0x1e4eb0: The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers the whole island.
0x1e4f00: I'll instruct you by Codec after you reach your target.
0x1e4f4c: Anyone going with me?
0x1e4f74: As usual, this is a one-man infiltration mission.
0x1e4fb8: Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)?
0x1e4ffc: Yes.
0x1e5014: This is a top-secret black op.
0x1e5044: Don't expect any official support.

0x2da0dc: The chief of DARPA
0x2da100: and the president of an arms manufacturing company...
0x2da148: What business did they have
0x2da174: at a nuclear weapons disposal facility?
0x2da1b0: ...The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted
0x2da1fc: at the time the terrorist group attacked.
0x2da238: Must be extremely important exercises
0x2da270: if those two were directly involved.
0x2da2a8: Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon?
0x2da2f0: I'm not privy to that information.
0x2da324: Do we know exactly where they're being held?
0x2da364: The DARPA Chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter.
0x2da3b8: As you get closer, you should be able to pick up
0x2da3fc: his location on your radar.

0x34610c: Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile?
0x34615c: They say they do.
0x346180: They even gave us the serial number of
0x3461b8: the warhead they plan to use.
0x3461e8: Was the number confirmed?
0x346214: I'm afraid so.
0x346234: At the very least, they've got their hands
0x346270: on a real nuclear warhead.
0x34629c: Isn't there some kind of safety device
0x3462d4: to prevent this type of terrorism?
0x346308: Yes,
0x346320: every missile and warhead in our arsenal
0x34635c: is equipped with a PAL
0x346384: which uses a discrete detonation code.
0x3463bc: PAL?
0x3463d4: 'Permissive Action Link'
0x346400: The safety control system built into all nuclear weapons systems.
0x346454: But even so, we can't rest easy.
0x346488: Why not?
0x3464a4: Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code.
0x3464e8: But even if they have a nuclear warhead,
0x346524: it must have been removed from its missile.
0x346564: All the missiles on these disposal sites
0x3465a0: supposed to be dismantled.
0x3465cc: It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM.
0x346610: That used to be true,
0x346638: but since the end of the Cold War,
0x34666c: you can get anything
0x346694: if you have enough money and the right connections.

0x407100: So, what exactly are they demanding?
0x407138: A person's remains.
0x40715c: Remains?
0x407178: That's right.
0x407198: To be more accurate,
0x4071c0: cell specimens, which contain the individual's genomic information.
0x407218: Cell specimens?
0x407238: Why would they want that?
0x407264: The terrorists need them.
0x407290: You see, these Next-Generation Special Forces
0x4072d0: have been strengthened through gene therapy.
0x407310: Strengthened?
0x407330: You've heard of the Human Genome Project.
0x40736c: They've been mapping the human genome
0x4073a4: and they're nearly finished.
0x4073d4: Following up on this research,
0x407404: the military has been working towards identifying those genes
0x407454: which are responsible for making effective soldiers.
0x40749c: There are genes that do that?
0x4074cc: Yes.
0x4074e4: And using gene therapy,
0x40750c: they're able to transplant those genes into regular soldiers.
0x40755c: Gene therapy?
0x40757c: I'll explain this part.
0x4075a4: With gene therapy, we can remove those genes
0x4075e4: which we know may lead to sickness or disease,
0x407624: and at the same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects,
0x407674: such as resistance to cancer for example.
0x4076b0: In other words,
0x4076d0: we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases,
0x407710: and at the same time,
0x407738: add genetic characteristics as desired.
0x407774: O.K.
0x40778c: And so, if you knew what genes were responsible
0x4077d0: for making the perfect soldier,
0x407800: you could implant them in the same way, right?
0x407840: Yes...we could.
0x407860: But, it all depends on being able to isolate
0x4078a0: and identify those "soldier genes".
0x4078d8: And, in order to do that,

0x51bb48: it's helpful if you can study the genomic information of
0x51bb94: one of the greatest soldiers ever.
0x51c972: ]Km>l^/;

0x52d8e4: One of the greatest soldiers ever?
0x52d918: The man they called the greatest warrior of the 20th century...
0x52d96c: You don't mean Big Boss!?
0x52d998: That's right.
0x52d9b8: We've been working feverishly to identify the genes
0x52da00: responsible for his incredible combat skill.
0x52da40: So far, we've discovered about 60 of the so-called
0x52da84: "soldier genes".
0x52daa8: So, his body was recovered after all.
0x52dae0: Yes,
0x52daf8: and his cells have remained frozen in a cryo-chamber.
0x52db40: His genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind.
0x52db90: Priceless to the military perhaps.
0x52dbc4: His body was burned severely,
0x52dbf4: but it was possible to restore his DNA  profile
0x52dc38: from just a single strand of his hair.
0x52dc70: You people are amazing.
0x52dc98: And then, you're gonna transplant those genes into soldiers?
0x52dce8: Yes,
0x52dd00: we'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting.
0x52dd50: The strongest soldiers don't become what they are
0x52dd94: by acquiring their skills through training or experience.
0x52dde0: We now know that hereditary factors are far more crucial
0x52de2c: for creating superior soldiers.
0x52de5c: Snake,
0x52de74: we can't give them his body.
0x52dea4: It's potentially more dangerous than all the nuclear warheads
0x52def4: on that island put together.
0x52df24: I hear the terrorists are calling themselves
0x52df64: "The Sons of Big Boss".
0x52df8c: "The Sons of Big Boss"

0x612884: What's the time limit?
0x6128ac: 24 hours.
0x6128c8: They say they'll launch after 24 hours.
0x612904: Do they say what the target will be?
0x61293c: So far they haven't mentioned the target.
0x612978: When did the countdown start?
0x6129a8: 5 hours ago.

0x647158: Colonel, who are you speaking for?
0x64718c: Naturally I'm representing the U.S. Government.
0x6471d0: So who's in supervisory control of this operation?
0x647214: ...The President of the United States.
0x64724c: Which means that the President must be meeting
0x64728c: with his top aides in the Map Room about now, huh?
0x6472d0: No, at this point they're still video conferencing with each other.
0x647328: If that's a real nuclear warhead,
0x64735c: shouldn't they issue a COG?
0x647388: Not yet.
0x6473a4: The Secretary of Defense has operational control
0x6473e8: and is fully aware of the situation.
0x647420: After you infiltrate,
0x647448: if you determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities,
0x647494: a COG will be issued.
0x6474bc: Well if they haven't relocated
0x6474ec: to the nuclear shelter under Mount Washington,
0x64752c: I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet.
0x647574: Is the National Security Agency in on this?
0x6475b4: Yes and so is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency.
0x647600: The DIA?
0x64761c: I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.
0x64765c: They'll be sending us some support.
0x647690: We don't need desk jockies.
0x6476bc: We need a nuclear weapons specialist.
0x6476f4: Of course.
0x647710: A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned to us.

0x7250c4: We need backup from a specialist.
0x7250f8: I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons.
0x725140: I know.
0x725158: That's why I've requested the assistance of
0x725198: a military analyst named Nastasha Romanenko.
0x7251d8: She'll be providing you backup by Codec.
0x725214: A female analyst?
0x725238: She's built up an impressive record as an advisor
0x72527c: for the Nuclear Emergency Search Team.
0x7252b4: Contact her if you have any questions.
0x7252ec: She's also an expert on hi tech weapons.
0x725328: Where's she working from?
0x725354: At her home in Los Angeles.
0x725380: California...
0x7253a0: Seems like a million miles away...

0x7a48a4: How well armed are these terrorists?
0x7a48dc: I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted.
0x7a4930: They're heavily armed, I'm afraid.
0x7a4964: What about their battle experience?
0x7a4998: The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans.
0x7a49ec: They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds.
0x7a4a34: I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND.
0x7a4a78: The others are Next-Generation Special Forces.
0x7a4ab8: They're not your average grunts, either.

0x7f30f4: Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces.
0x7f313c: They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit
0x7f3184: made up of former members of biochem units,
0x7f31c4: technical escort units
0x7f31ec: and the Nuclear Emergency Search Team.
0x7f3224: Their purpose was to respond to threats
0x7f3260: involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction,
0x7f32a8: including NBC weapons.
0x7f32d0: Until "they" were added, that is.
0x7f3304: Who's "they"?
0x7f3324: These guys didn't start out as regular army.
0x7f3364: Looks like a pretty international group.
0x7f33a0: Mercenaries?
0x7f33c0: Yeah,
0x7f33d8: and it gets worse.
0x7f33fc: Most of them were from a merc agency
0x7f3434: that I think you're familiar with.
0x7f3468: They were part of Big Boss's private guard.
0x7f34a8: And after Big Boss went down,
0x7f34d8: the military just bought out all their contracts.
0x7f351c: Outer Heaven...
0x7f353c: After that,
0x7f3558: they were merged with our own VR Unit, "Force 21",
0x7f359c: and retrained.
0x7f35bc: If you ask me, these so-called "Next-Generation Special Forces"
0x7f3610: should be called "simulated soldiers".
0x7f3648: They have no real battle experience.
0x7f3680: Video game players, huh?
0x7f36ac: Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy.
0x7f36fc: They carry genes which make them excellent soldiers.
0x7f3744: Don't get careless just because they don't have much experience.
0x7f3798: I thought using genetically modified soldiers was
0x7f37dc: prohibited by international law.
0x7f3810: Yes,
0x7f3828: but those are just declarations, not actual treaties.
0x7f3870: The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit
0x7f38c0: conspired in this attack.

0x90a9b4: How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion?
0x90a9fc: They're calling it a revolution.
0x90aa30: Since they all went through the same gene therapy,
0x90aa74: they probably felt closer than brothers.
0x90aab0: They see the unit as their only family.
0x90aaec: The Sons of Big Boss...
0x90ab14: but if they were regular army
0x90ab44: they must have been interviewed periodically by army counselors...
0x90ab98: According to their files,
0x90abc4: they all got straight A's on their psychological tests.
0x90ac10: They all seemed like fine, upstanding, patriotic soldiers.
0x90ac5c: But they all took part in the uprising?
0x90ac98: No.
0x90acac: Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise.
0x90acf8: That's why there was a re-supply of troops.
0x90ad38: Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong?
0x90ad84: There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely.
0x90add8: Apparently, they consulted classified information
0x90ae1c: about the soldier genes
0x90ae44: and performed their own gene therapy experiments.
0x90ae88: They can do that even without you?
0x90aebc: Well, our gene therapy process is almost completely automated.
0x90af0c: And besides that, they're all geniuses with IQs over 180.
0x90af58: Even the existence of this genome army
0x90af90: is a national secret of the highest order.
0x90afcc: We had been hoping to investigate this thing quietly
0x90b014: and deal with it behind closed doors.

0x9e98b0: High Tech Special Forces Unit FOX-HOUND.
0x9e98ec: Your former unit...
0x9e9910: and one that I was a commander of.
0x9e9944: An elite group combining firepower and expertise.
0x9e9988: They're every bit as good as when I was commanding them.
0x9e99d4: So they're still around...
0x9e9a00: There are six members of FOX-HOUND
0x9e9a34: involved in this terrorist activity.
0x9e9a6c: Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities.
0x9e9ab4: Sniper Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.
0x9e9afc: Decoy Octopus, master of disguise.
0x9e9b30: Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman.
0x9e9b64: And Revolver Ocelot,
0x9e9b8c: specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter.
0x9e9bd8: Looks like a lovely bunch of folks.
0x9e9c0c: Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances...
0x9e9c54: And finally, in charge of them...
0x9e9c88: FOX-HOUND's squad leader,
0x9e9cb4: Liquid Snake.
0x9e9cd4: Liquid Snake?
0x9e9cf4: Yes.
0x9e9d0c: And you're the only person who can stand against him.

0xaad8fc: Liquid Snake?
0xaad91c: Liquid Snake.
0xaad93c: The man with the same code name as you.
0xaad978: Tell me what you know.
0xaad9a0: He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager,
0xaad9dc: the youngest person in the SAS.
0xaada0c: His job was to track down and destroy
0xaada44: mobile SCUD missile launching platforms...
0xaada80: You were there too, I believe.
0xaadab0: Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets?
0xaadb04: I was just a kid myself back then.
0xaadb38: The details are classified, but it seems that originally
0xaadb84: he penetrated the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS.
0xaadbd0: He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service?
0xaadc1c: But he never once showed his face in Century House.
0xaadc64: He was taken prisoner in Iraq
0xaadc94: and after that there was no trace of him for several years.
0xaadce4: After you retired, he was rescued
0xaadd18: and became a member of FOX-HOUND.
0xaadd4c: I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using code names.
0xaadda8: I don't know his real name.
0xaaddd4: That information is so highly classified that even I can't look at it.
0xaade2c: Here's a photo of him.
0xaade54: Pretty shocking, huh?
0xaade7c: His skin tone is different,
0xaadea8: but otherwise you two are exact duplicates.
0xaadee8: I have a twin?
0xaadf08: I don't know the details,
0xaadf34: but it seems so.
0xaadf58: That's why we really need you for this mission.
0xaadf9c: You're the only one who can beat him.
0xaadfd4: Now that I've met you, I know.
0xaae004: You've got something that he doesn't.
0xaae03c: I can see it in your eyes.
0xaae068: Why don't I find that thought more comforting?

0xbe0b40: Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore.
0xbe0b84: Let me go back to Twin Lakes.
0xbe0bb4: Why, Snake?
0xbe0bd0: Is your life in Alaska all that great?
0xbe0c08: There's a dog sled race this week.
0xbe0c3c: Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage.
0xbe0c78: The Iditarod?
0xbe0c98: The longest sled race in the World?
0xbe0ccc: When did you become a dog musher?
0xbe0d00: Right now my fifty huskies are my only family.
0xbe0d40: I've got to take care of them.
0xbe0d70: Don't worry about your dogs.
0xbe0da0: What do you mean?
0xbe0dc4: I'm sorry Snake,
0xbe0de8: but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea...
0xbe0e2c: there's no room for debate.
0xbe0e58: I told you.
0xbe0e74: Even if I do owe you,
0xbe0e9c: I don't owe anything to this army or this country!
0xbe0ee0: You will accept this assignment.
0xbe0f14: Why should I be stupid enough to do that?
0xbe0f50: I'm no patriot.
0xbe0f70: Snake,
0xbe0f88: there's enough dirt in your file, from your days as an agent,
0xbe0fd8: to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man.
0xbe1024: Oh I see...
0xbe1040: blackmail.
0xbe105c: No, Snake.
0xbe1078: I prefer to look at it as
0xbe10a4: helping you come to a decision more easily.
0xbe10e4: But anyway,
0xbe1100: I know you better than that.
0xbe1130: You'd take this assignment even without the threat.
0xbe1178: Why do you say that?
0xbe11a0: You're a natural born soldier.
0xbe11d0: You're not the grow old gracefully type.
0xbe120c: It's the same for all of us who've seen real action.
0xbe1254: The only place we can feel truly alive is on the battlefield.
0xbe12a4: I'm a soldier too.
0xbe12c8: I know those feelings of powerlessness,
0xbe1304: frustration that you feel everyday...
0xbe133c: You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska.

0xcf763c: But you can't race dogs in the snow forever.
0xcf767c: Why don't you come back to us
0xcf76ac: and be a soldier again.
0xcf76d4: You think my life is some kind of a joke?
0xcf7710: Snake,
0xcf7728: I just want to give you back your purpose in life.

0xd2c958: Colonel, you're retired.
0xd2c984: Why are you involved in this?
0xd2c9b4: Because there aren't many people
0xd2c9e8: who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do.
0xd2ca20: Is that really the only reason?
0xd2ca50: I've been soldiering for a long time.
0xd2ca88: I don't know anything else.
0xd2cab4: I guess even though I'm getting a little old,
0xd2caf4: I still love to be in the field.
0xd2cb28: Colonel,
0xd2cb44: you're a lousy liar.
0xd2cb6c: Tell me the real reason.
0xd2cb98: Okay, Snake.
0xd2cbb8: Sorry.
0xd2cbd0: I'll be frank.
0xd2cbf0: A person very dear to me is being held hostage.
0xd2cc34: Who is it?
0xd2cc50: My niece,
0xd2cc6c: Meryl.

0xd9c13c: What was your niece doing here?
0xd9c16c: Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt,
0xd9c1bc: and my niece was one of those called in
0xd9c1f8: as an emergency replacement.
0xd9c228: She looks like you.
0xd9c24c: She's my little brother's girl.
0xd9c27c: He died in the Gulf War,
0xd9c2a8: and since then I've been watching after her.
0xd9c2e8: A personal motive, Colonel...
0xd9c318: that's not very soldierly.
0xd9c344: I'm retired.
0xd9c364: I'm just an old man now...
0xd9c390: and I'm your friend.
0xd9c3b8: Since when are we friends?
0xd9c3e4: I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar.
0xd9c430: With my personality,
0xd9c458: I don't have too many friends.
0xd9c488: That's what I trust about you.
0xd9c4b8: It's what makes you human.
0xd9c4e4: Please, Snake!
0xd9c504: Save my niece, Meryl!
0xd9c52c: All right.
0xd9c548: But I have two conditions.
0xd9c574: Name them.
0xd9c590: One,
0xd9c5a8: no more secrets between us.
0xd9c5d4: I want complete disclosure at all times.
0xd9c610: And two,
0xd9c62c: I'll only accept orders directly from you, Colonel.
0xd9c674: No cutoffs involved, okay?
0xd9c6a0: Agreed.
0xd9c6b8: That's why I was called.
0xd9c6e4: But one thing...
0xd9c708: What?
0xd9c720: I'm not a Colonel anymore,
0xd9c74c: just a retired old warhorse.
0xd9c77c: I understand...
0xd9c79c: Colonel.

0xe8d910: That doctor.
0xe8d930: Is she part of this operation too?
0xe8d964: She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy.
0xe8d9a4: She knows more about those men than anyone else.
0xe8d9e8: You mean you've seen them naked?
0xe8da1c: Make no mistake.
0xe8da40: I'm not a nurse.
0xe8da64: I am a scientist.
0xe8da88: By the way,
0xe8daa4: what was that injection for?
0xe8dad4: It's a combination of nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide
0xe8db28: so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze,
0xe8db74: even at sub-arctic temperatures...
0xe8dba8: Nanomachines?
0xe8dbc8: Not just one kind either.
0xe8dbf4: There are different types
0xe8dc20: which will replenish the supply of adrenaline,
0xe8dc60: nutrition and sugar in your bloodstream.
0xe8dc9c: Now I don't have to worry about food.
0xe8dcd4: I also put some nootropics in there.
0xe8dd0c: Say what?
0xe8dd28: Nootropics.
0xe8dd44: A class of drugs which will help improve your mental functioning.
0xe8dd98: It'll make me smarter, huh?
0xe8ddc4: Anything else?
0xe8dde4: Yes,
0xe8ddfc: benzedrine.
0xe8de18: Its a type of stimulant.
0xe8de44: It'll keep you alert and responsive for twelve straight hours.
0xe8de94: That was quite a cocktail.
0xe8dec0: Anything else in there?
0xe8dee8: Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's
0xe8df28: batteries charged up.
0xe8df50: I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.
0xe8df98: You're welcome.

0xf92a6c: Wow...,
0xf92a84: he must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather.
0xf92acc: Who's that?
0xf92ae8: Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.
0xf92b24: This is Mei Ling. She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.
0xf92b8c: She designed your Codec as well as your Soliton radar system.
0xf92bdc: Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.
0xf92c28: Nice to meet you, Snake.
0xf92c54: It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.
0xf92ca0: ..........
0xf92cbc: What's wrong.
0xf92cdc: Nothing...
0xf92cf8: I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so cute.
0xf92d74: you're just flattering me...
0xf92da4: No, I'm serious.
0xf92dc8: Well I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
0xf92e0c: C'mon.
0xf92e24: ..I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...
0xf92e74: But I'm surprised...
0xf92e9c: You're very frank for a trained killer.
0xf92ed4: Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.
0xf92f20: Yeah.
0xf92f38: I'm looking forward to learning about the man behind the legend,...

0x104a864: Is this all there is to load?

0x1050860: To the Heliport, huh...
0x1055060: To the canyon, huh...
0x1059068: To nuclear warhead storage, huh...

0x106006c: The snowfield north of the towers, huh...

0x108485c: Hey!
0x1088060: Shut up!
0x108c064: Hey! Shut up!
0x108d064: Shut up in there, willya!
0x109305c: Ooooooo...
0x1098068: No! Meryl!
0x10a0868: Damn! Meryl!
0x10b4054: .........
0x10b4070: .........
0x10c1860: Snake.
0x10c5390: I've got something to tell you about Naomi Hunter.
0x10c53d4: What about her?
0x10c53f4: Is this conversation secure?
0x10c5424: Don't worry.
0x10c5444: The monitor's off.
0x10c5468: Okay.
0x10c5480: What's up?
0x10c549c: I was in the FBI too, y'know.
0x10c54cc: I didn't know that. What's your point?
0x10c5504: Dr. Hunter's story about her background...
0x10c5540: ...about her grandfather being an assistant secretary to Hoover in the FBI...
0x10c55a0: Yeah?
0x10c55b8: And then going undercover to investigate the Mafia in New York..
0x10c560c: Yeah, what about it?
0x10c5634: It was all a big lie.
0x10c565c: What did you say?
0x10c5680: It was really bothering me.
0x10c56ac: Why would she lie about it?
0x10c56d8: She lied?
0x10c56f4: She might be a spy!
0x10c5718: Ridiculous.
0x10c5734: C'mon. Even a high school student could see past it.
0x10c577c: The head of the FBI at that time, Edgar Hoover...he was a well-known racist.
0x10c57dc: Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese?
0x10c581c: Yeah...
0x10c5834: Well back then there wasn't a single Asian investigator.
0x10c5880: Also, in the 50's the undercover Mafia sting operations hadn't even started yet.
0x10c58e4: They first started in 1960...in Chicago, not New York.
0x10c592c: But...
0x10c5944: You better check it out.
0x10c5970: The chief and the president mysteriously dying, that ninja...too many strange things are happening.
0x10c59e4: Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?
0x10c5a24: I don't know.
0x10c5a44: Either that or she's working with the terrorists.
0x10c5a88: ...Could it be?
0x10c5aa8: If I find out anything, I'll call.
0x10c5adc: In the meantime, be careful!

0x11f9860: What's that...?
0x123ab0c: Snake, it's me...
0x123ab30: Master?
0x123ab48: It's about Naomi.
0x123ab6c: Turn your monitor off...
0x123ab98: What about Naomi?
0x123abbc: Damn!
0x123abd4: Colonel, is Naomi there?
0x123ac00: No she's away.
0x123ac20: She's taking a short nap.
0x123ac4c: Hmmm...
0x123ac64: So what is this about Naomi?
0x123ac94: Okay.
0x123acac: Maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this too.
0x123acf0: Yeah...go on Master.
0x123ad18: Well basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at all.
0x123ad6c: What!?
0x123ad84: I thought her story of her background sounded kind of fishy, so I checked it out.
0x123ade8: And?...
0x123ae00: There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter, or I should say there was one...
0x123ae58: But she's not the woman we know.
0x123ae8c: The real Naomi Hunter disappeared somewhere in the Middle East.
0x123aedc: Our Naomi must have somehow obtained her identification papers.
0x123af2c: So then who is she really?
0x123af58: She must be some kind of...spy.
0x123af88: A spy?!!
0x123afa4: Yes...maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation.
0x123afec: Are you saying she's with the terrorists?
0x123b028: ...I don't want to believe it either.
0x123b060: But she is working for FOX-HOUND...
0x123b094: So you think she had a part in the uprising?
0x123b0d4: Or she could be working with some different group altogether.

0x1328280: A different group...?
0x13282a8: It couldn't be...
0x13282cc: Place her under arrest her, Colonel.
0x1328304: What!
0x132831c: She's betrayed us, Colonel.
0x1328348: She needs to be arrested and interrogated to find out who she's with.
0x13283a0: If she's one of their spies, then we're in big trouble...
0x13283ec: What do you mean!?
0x1328410: Oh nothing...
0x1328430: Colonel, have you let her in on some kind of vital secret or something?
0x1328488: ......
0x13284a0: Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths of the DARPA Chief and ArmsTech president?
0x1328514: I...I have no idea.
0x1328538: Anyway, we cannot allow her to participate any futher in this mission.
0x1328590: Wait, wait a minute.
0x13285b8: Without her, we can't complete this mission.
0x13285f8: I knew it. You're hiding something.
0x132862c: Give me some time.
0x1328650: I'll try to get it out of her...
0x1328684: Hurry then.
0x13286a0: We've got to figure out who she is and what she's ding here.
0x13286f0: I understand.
0x1328710: Snake, give me some time.
0x132873c: I don't have any time left for you.

0x13de890: Snake...it's me.
0x13de8b4: What's wrong?
0x13de8d4: Did you find a good place to hide?
0x13de908: Yeah, thanks to the stealth gear.

0x13f2230: It looks like they've finished getting Metal Gear ready.
0x13f227c: How do you know that?
0x13f22a4: I overheard them talking.
0x13f22d0: Where are you now?
0x13f22f4: Right in front of Metal Gear. ...but it's strange.
0x13f2338: What is?
0x13f2354: There's nobody here...
0x13f237c: ...no guards, nobody patrolling...
0x13f23b0: ...it's too quiet.
0x13f23d4: Maybe because they're all ready.
0x13f2408: They said they even input the PAL codes.
0x13f2444: What should I do?
0x13f2468: All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told you about.
0x13f24c8: But I've only got one of the three keys.
0x13f2504: And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys...
0x13f2560: Leave it to me...
0x13f2584: You got some kind of plan?
0x13f25b0: Well, I'm in the computer room right now.
0x13f25ec: I'm trying to access Baker's private files.
0x13f2628: Baker's files?
0x13f2648: Don't you need a password?
0x13f2674: Of course. But there are ways...
0x13f26a8: Are you a hacker?
0x13f26cc: Yup. That describes me pretty well.
0x13f2700: Does it look like you can get in?
0x13f2734: I don't know yet.
0x13f2758: I'll give it a try.
0x13f277c: I'm counting on you...

0x14a2064: Snake...it's me again.

0x14a78d0: How's it going?
0x14a78f0: Hmmm...not bad.
0x14a7910: I just got past his 3rd security level.
0x14a7948: He was a pretty careful guy.
0x14a7978: Do you think you'll break in soon?
0x14a79ac: I've never met a system I couldn't bust into.
0x14a79ec: Okay, keep trying...

0x14d339c: Snake, I did it!
0x14d33c0: You got past security?
0x14d33e8: Bingo!!!
0x14d3404: Great! So whaddya got?
0x14d342c: I accessed the confidential Metal Gear file.
0x14d346c: So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about?
0x14d34bc: Haven't found it yet...
0x14d34e4: That's what I need to know!
0x14d3510: But Snake, I found something else!
0x14d3544: What?
0x14d355c: The secret behind the new nuclear weapon!
0x14d3598: Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun like a projectile...
0x14d3610: It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't considered a missile.
0x14d3658: That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties.
0x14d36a8: Pretty sneaky.
0x14d36c8: Yes, but effective.
0x14d36ec: And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon.
0x14d3738: I can't wait to hear this.
0x14d3764: It's a stealth weapon!
0x14d378c: You mean it won't show up on radar?
0x14d37c0: Yeah.
0x14d37d8: The truth is...they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's.
0x14d3838: Why weren't they able to develop one up until now?
0x14d387c: Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system...it  picked up by enemy satellites.
0x14d38e4: Oh yeah, that makes sense.
0x14d3910: But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellent.
0x14d3960: So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems.
0x14d39bc: An invisible nuclear warhead...
0x14d39ec: Totally impossible to intercept.
0x14d3a20: And on top of that it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases.
0x14d3a9c: We learned that lesson in the Gulf War.
0x14d3ad4: This thing could mean the end of the world!
0x14d3b10: It's the ultimate weapon.
0x14d3b3c: And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.

0x15f1e20: Colonel, is this true? Are you listening?

0x15fa3b8: I'm listening...
0x15fa3dc: If word of this got out,
0x15fa408: it could delay the signing of the start 3 treaty and cause a huge international incident
0x15fa474: Yeah, it would be nasty.
0x15fa4a0: The United States would be denounced by the U.N...it could even bring the President down...
0x15fa50c: Did you know this, Colonel?!
0x15fa53c: I'm sorry...
0x15fa55c: You've changed, Colonel...
0x15fa588: I won't make any excuses...
0x15fa5b4: Snake, listen to me.
0x15fa5dc: This new nuclear weapon...it's never actually been tested, only simulated.
0x15fa638: You mean they ran a computer model?
0x15fa66c: Yeah, that's why they were conducting this exercise.
0x15fa6b4: They needed to get actual experimental data to back up the simulation.
0x15fa70c: What were the results of the exercise?
0x15fa744: It looks like it went better than they hoped for.
0x15fa788: But...I can't find the data anywhere on this network.
0x15fa7d0: You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded...
0x15fa82c: It was. President Baker gave me an optical disk with all of the test data.
0x15fa888: What?! Do you still have it?
0x15fa8b8: No. Ocelot took it from me.
0x15fa8e4: Damn...
0x15fa8fc: The terrorists have replaced dummy warhead with a real warhead.
0x15fa94c: Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch.
0x15fa9a4: So you think they can do it?
0x15fa9d4: Well, the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so.
0x15faa3c: Did you find out how to override it yet?
0x15faa78: Not yet. It must be in a separate file.
0x15faab0: Right now I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files.
0x15fab00: We're counting on you...

0x170d1d4: Snake?
0x170d1ec: Did you find it?
0x170d210: No, I haven't found out about the override system yet, but I found Baker's ulterior motive.
0x170d27c: He's just looking to get rich, isn't he?
0x170d2b8: That's part of it. ArmsTech is in much worse financial trouble than I thought.
0x170d318: I know they lost their bid to make the next generation fighter jet. That plus the reduction in SDI spending...
0x170d398: It looks like there was even some talk of a hostile takeover.
0x170d3e8: Everything was riding on this project, I guess.
0x170d428: And it looks like we were paying a lot of bribe money to the DARPA Chief.
0x170d484: Bribe money, huh.
0x170d4a8: Yeah, and Baker was a big proponent of the nuclear deterrent theory.
0x170d500: I see... So anyway, what about the override?
0x170d540: Just give me a little bit longer...

0x178eabc: Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!
0x178eaf8: Great job.
0x178eb14: How's it going there?
0x178eb3c: They've finished inputting the PAL codes.
0x178eb78: So how do we deactivate them?
0x178eba8: Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about...
0x178ec04: It can also be used to input the detonation codes.
0x178ec48: Y'see if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it.
0x178eca4: And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated.
0x178ecf8: And you can only use the keys once.
0x178ed2c: Only once, huh.
0x178ed4c: Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time.
0x178ed98: But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!
0x178ede4: Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick.
0x178ee20: You already have all three keys!
0x178ee54: What are you talking about!?
0x178ee84: The card key is made of a shape memory alloy.
0x178eec4: Shape memory alloy?
0x178eee8: Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures.
0x178ef3c: The key is made out of it!
0x178ef68: This card key?
0x178ef88: Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures.
0x178efd4: So this key is actually three keys in one...clever.

0x186c378: Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter...
0x186c3ac: Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it.
0x186c3f8: Turn your monitor off.
0x186c420: Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead.
0x186c464: Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear.
0x186c4a4: Okay, so what's up?
0x186c4c8: I've got a good friend in the Pentagon...
0x186c504: Yeah...
0x186c51c: He's the one who told me about it...
0x186c554: It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of assassination weapon.
0x186c5b4: An assassination weapon?
0x186c5e0: Snake, have you ever heard of something called "Fox Die"?
0x186c62c: No...
0x186c644: Fox Die?
0x186c660: ...Liquid and others were talking about it...
0x186c6a0: Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people.
0x186c6ec: I don't know all the details, but...
0x186c724: What are you trying to say?
0x186c750: It's too similar.
0x186c774: What is!?
0x186c790: The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,...
0x186c800: ...die of something that looked like a heart attack?
0x186c848: Yeah...?
0x186c864: Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart attack.
0x186c8c0: ..........
0x186c8dc: ...No...You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?
0x186c920: Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?
0x186c974: ...The nanomachines.
0x186c99c: She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was.
0x186ca00: ...Does the Colonel know?
0x186ca2c: I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her.
0x186ca70: Okay. I'll ask him myself.

0x1994a0c: Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?
0x1994a4c: I just placed Naomi under arrest.
0x1994a80: Arrest?
0x1994a98: She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base.
0x1994ae4: I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists.
0x1994b40: Are you sure?
0x1994b60: I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now.
0x1994ba0: What kind of interrogation?
0x1994bcc: Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here.
0x1994c38: Call me if you find out anything.
0x1994c6c: So it's true, isn't it?
0x1994c94: Naomi...I can't believe it.
0x1994cc0: That means the Fox Die vaccine must be around somewhere.
0x1994d0c: Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about.
0x1994d4c: But Snake...you might be infected too, you know.
0x1994d90: All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel.

0x1a23b34: Snake, can you hear me?
0x1a23b5c: It's Naomi...
0x1a23b7c: Naomi?!
0x1a23b94: ...what the hell?!
0x1a23bb8: Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different Codec.
0x1a23c10: Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?
0x1a23c48: ...Yes.
0x1a23c74: Who are you?
0x1a23c94: I don't know myself.
0x1a23cbc: I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.
0x1a23d0c: I bought all my identification.
0x1a23d3c: But my reason for getting into genetics was true.
0x1a23d80: Cause you want to know yourself, right?
0x1a23db8: That's right. I want to know where I came from...my age, my race...anything.
0x1a23e18: Naomi...
0x1a23e34: I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's...
0x1a23e74: ...a dirty little orphan...
0x1a23ea0: Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?
0x1a23ed8: Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.
0x1a23f48: That's probably where I got my skin color from,...
0x1a23f8c: Naomi, you're too worried about the past.
0x1a23fc8: Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?
0x1a24008: Understand who I am now?!
0x1a24034: Why should I?No one else tries to understand me. 
0x1a24078: I was alone for so long...
0x1a240a4: ...until I met my big brother and "him".
0x1a240e0: Your big brother?
0x1a24104: Yes.
0x1a2411c: Frank Jaeger.

0x1d2ca68: What?!
0x1d2ca80: He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi River.
0x1d2cad8: I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations with me.
0x1d2cb2c: Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my only family.
0x1d2cb90: No...
0x1d2cba8: Gray Fox?
0x1d2cbc4: We survived that hell together, Frank and I.
0x1d2cc04: He protected me.
0x1d2cc28: He's my one connection...
0x1d2cc54: ...the only connection that I have to my past.
0x1d2cc94: And he brought you back to America?
0x1d2ccc8: No.
0x1d2ccdc: I was in Mozambique when "he" came.
0x1d2cd14: Who is "he"`?
0x1d2cd34: ...You mean Big Boss?
0x1d2cd5c: Yes.
0x1d2cd74: He brought us to this "land of freedom", this America.
0x1d2cdc0: But then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.
0x1d2ce14: And that's when it happened...
0x1d2ce44: You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.
0x1d2ce94: I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.
0x1d2cecc: I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I would...
0x1d2cf30: So were your prayers answered?

0x200b9b8: Yes. I waited two long years...
0x200b9e8: To kill me?
0x200ba04: Is that all you cared about?
0x200ba34: Yes. That's right.
0x200ba58: Two years.
0x200ba74: You were all I thought about for two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession...
0x200bae0: Do you still hate me?
0x200bb08: ...Not exactly.
0x200bb28: I was partly wrong about you...
0x200bb58: What about Liquid and the others?
0x200bb8c: I'll have my revenge on them too!
0x200bbc0: Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?
0x200bc04: The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments...
0x200bc50: Dr. Clark?
0x200bc6c: ...No...that was brother.
0x200bc98: Afterwards I covered it up and helped him hide out...

0x209b910: So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox...
0x209b944: ...he's come here to kill me?
0x209b974: ...I don't think so.
0x209b99c: I think he just came here to fight you...
0x209b9d8: I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.
0x209ba1c: A final battle with you...
0x209ba48: ...that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it...
0x209ba88: ...Fox...no...
0x209baa8: Naomi, tell me something...
0x209bad4: ...about Fox Die?

0x20ed214: Fox Die is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.
0x20ed274: First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.
0x20ed2bc: Fox Die contains "smart" enzymes, created through protein engineering.
0x20ed318: They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells.
0x20ed374: Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?
0x20ed3b0: Right. They respond by becoming  active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.
0x20ed428: Huh?
0x20ed440: It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.
0x20ed490: The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart,where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells.
0x20ed51c: And then...they cause a heart attack?
0x20ed554: The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then...
0x20ed5b0: ...the victim dies.
0x20ed5d4: Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide...

0x219530c: ...Naomi...
0x2195328: ...What?
0x2195344: ...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right?
0x2195394: ..........
0x21953b0: Do I still have time?
0x21953d8: ..........
0x21953f4: Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.
0x2195434: But I can't go yet. I still have a job to do.
0x2195474: Listen, Snake.
0x2195494: ...I'm not the one who made the decision to use Fox Die.
0x21954e0: Huh?
0x21954f8:  You weren't?
0x2195530: You were injected with Fox Die as a part of this operation.
0x219557c: I just wanted to let you know that...
0x21955b4: ...No, that's not the whole truth...
0x21955ec: Huh?
0x2195604: The real thing that I wanted to tell you was...
0x2195648: Snake, I...I...
0x2195668: Hey! What are you doing!?
0x2195694: Eeeek!!
0x21956ac: Ooooh....
0x21956c8: Snake.....
0x21956e4: Naomi!?
0x21956fc: ...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.
0x2195758: What!
0x2195770: Naomi's been removed from this operation.
0x21957ac: What happened to Naomi!?
0x21957d8: What did she mean when she said that Fox Die was a part of this operation!?
0x2195834: Colonel, let me talk to her!
0x2195864: I won't. She's under arrest.
0x2195894: Colonel...
0x21958b0: ...you double crossed me!
0x21958dc: Snake, there's no time for that!
0x2195910: Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear!
0x219594c: ...Okay, Snake?!

0x24cc368: Thank you, Snake.
0x24cc38c: Now the detonation code is completed.
0x24cc3c4: Nothing can stop Metal Gear now.
0x24cc3f8: Master, what's going on?
0x24cc424: You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.
0x24cc498: Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.
0x24cc4f0: What are you talking about?
0x24cc51c: We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.
0x24cc560: Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he couldn't read his mind.
0x24cc5b0: Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.
0x24cc600: In other words, we weren't able to  launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.
0x24cc678: Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met.
0x24cc6d0: What do you mean?
0x24cc6f4: Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way.
0x24cc744: That's when I decided...you might prove useful, Snake.
0x24cc78c: What?
0x24cc7a4: First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.
0x24cc7f4: So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.
0x24cc840: Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to Fox Die.

0x27a73d4: You mean you had this planned from the beginning?
0x27a7418: Just to get me to input the detonation code!?...
0x27a745c: Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?
0x27a74b0: Who the hell are you?!
0x27a74d8: In any case, the launch preparations are complete.
0x27a751c: Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon,
0x27a7560: the White House will have no choice but to surrender the Fox Die vaccine to me.
0x27a75c0: Their ace-in-the-hole is useless now...
0x27a75f8: Ace-in-the-hole?
0x27a761c: The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful...
0x27a7668: ...in the torture room.
0x27a7690: Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.
0x27a76d0: Poor fool.
0x27a76ec: Who are you anyway!?
0x27a7714: I'll tell you everything you want to know.
0x27a7750: If you come to where I am, that is.
0x27a7784: Where are you?
0x27a77a4: Very close by.
0x27a77c4: Snake, that's not Master Miller!
0x27a77f8: Campbell, you're too late.
0x27a7824: Master Miller's body was just discovered at his home.
0x27a786c: He's been dead for at least three days.
0x27a78a4: I didn't know because my Codec link with Master was cut off.
0x27a78f4: But Mei Ling said his transmission signal was coming from inside the base!
0x27a7950: So who is it?
0x27a7970: Snake, you've been talking to...
0x27a79a4: ...Me...
0x27a79c0: ...dear brother.
0x27a79e4: Liquid?! How the...!?
0x27a7a0c: You've served your purpose.
0x27a7a38: You may die now!

0x2b2c8b4: Snake, that's bullet-proof glass. You can't break it with an ordinary weapon.
0x2b2c914: Can't you open the security lock here?
0x2b2c94c: I'll try. Just hold on for a minute.

0x2b4a074: C'mon hurry up already!
0x2b4a09c: Hang on!

0x2b5407c: I'm outta time!
0x2b5409c: Just hold on a little longer!

0x2b5f874: Otacon!
0x2b5f88c: Almost there. Hold on!

0x2b6a878: I hacked into security.
0x2b6a8a0: Snake! I'm opening the door!

0x2b78060: Did that do it!?

0x2b7d908: Now...
0x2b7d920: in front of you...
0x2b7d944: I can finally die...
0x2b7d96c: After Zanzibar...
0x2b7d990: I was taken from the battle...
0x2b7d9c0: neither truly alive nor truly dead...
0x2b7d9f8: an undying shadow in the world of lights...
0x2b7da38: But soon...
0x2b7da54: ...soon...
0x2b7da70: It will...finally...
0x2b7da98: end...

0x2bd5864: Nice shot!!
0x2bda86c: Damn!
0x2bda884: Useless piece of junk!!

0x2be63ac: Sleeping late as usual,
0x2be63d4: ...eh Snake?
0x2be63f4: Liquid...you're still alive...
0x2be6424: I won't die.
0x2be6444: ...as long as you still live.
0x2be6474: Too bad.
0x2be6490: It looks like your revolution was a failure.
0x2be64d0: Just because you've destroyed Metal Gear
0x2be650c: doesn't mean I'm done fighting.
0x2be653c: Fighting?
0x2be6558: What are you really after?
0x2be6584: A world where warriors like us
0x2be65b4: are honored as we once were...
0x2be65e4: ...as we should be.
0x2be6608: That was Big Boss's fantasy.
0x2be6638: It was his dying wish!
0x2be6660: When he was young, during the Cold War,
0x2be669c: the world needed men like us.
0x2be66cc: We were valued then. We were desired.
0x2be6704: But things...
0x2be6724: are different now.
0x2be6748: With all the liars and hypocrites running the world,
0x2be6790: war isn't what it used to be...
0x2be67c0: We're losing our place in a world that no longer needs us.
0x2be680c: A world that now spurns our very existence.
0x2be684c: You should know that as well as I do.
0x2be6884: After I launch this weapon and get our billion dollars,
0x2be68d0: we'll be able to bring chaos and honor
0x2be6908: ...back to this world gone soft.
0x2be693c: Conflict will breed conflict, new hatreds will arise.
0x2be6984: Then!
0x2be699c: ...we'll steadily expand our sphere of influence.
0x2be69e0: But as long as there are people,
0x2be6a14: there will always be war.
0x2be6a40: But the problem...
0x2be6a64: ...is balance.
0x2be6a84: Father knew what type of a balance was best...
0x2be6ac4: Is that the only reason?
0x2be6af0: Isn't it reason enough?
0x2be6b18: For warriors such as us.
0x2be6b44: I don't want that kind of world!
0x2be6b78: Ha!
0x2be6b8c: You lie!
0x2be6ba8: So why are you here then?

0x2d26fa8: Why do you continue to follow your orders
0x2d26fe4: while your superiors betray you?
0x2d27018: Why did you come here?
0x2d27040: ......
0x2d27058: Well...
0x2d27070: I'll tell you then.
0x2d27094: You enjoy all the killing,
0x2d270c0: that's why.
0x2d270dc: What!
0x2d270f4: Are you denying it?
0x2d27118: Haven't you already killed most of my comrades?
0x2d2715c: That was...
0x2d27178: I watched your face when you did it.
0x2d271b0: It was filled with the joy of battle.
0x2d271e8: You're wrong!
0x2d27208: There's a killer inside you...
0x2d27238: You don't have to deny it.
0x2d27264: We were created to be that way.
0x2d27294: Created?

0x2da4ba4: Colonel! Can you hear me?
0x2da4bd0: Yes...I'm listening.
0x2da4bf8: What is the Pentagon trying to do!? Colonel!
0x2da4c38: Colonel! Answer me!
0x2da4c5c: The Secretary of Defense has taken over active control of this operation.
0x2da4cb8: He's on his way there by AWACS.
0x2da4ce8: What for?
0x2da4d04: To bomb the place.
0x2da4d28: What!?
0x2da4d40: Not only that.
0x2da4d60: B-2 Bombers just lifted off from Galena Airforce Base.
0x2da4da8: They're carrying B61-13 surface- piercing tactical nuclear bombs.
0x2da4dfc: What?! Metal Gear is destroyed. Tell the Secretary of Defense!
0x2da4e4c: The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us and he's worried about Fox Die.
0x2da4eb8: Now that there's no more danger of a nuclear strike from Metal Gear,
0x2da4f10: he's going to do whatever's necessary to cover up the truth of what really happened here.
0x2da4f7c: He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence along with anyone who knows anything...
0x2da4ff4: Don't worry, Snake.
0x2da5018: I'll stop the nuclear strike.
0x2da5048: How?
0x2da5060: I may only be a figurehead here, but I'm still officially in command of this mission.
0x2da50c8: If I issue an order to delay the strike. It'll confuse the chain of command and at least buy you some time.
0x2da5144: It'll give you a chance to escape!
0x2da5178: But Colonel, if you do that...
0x2da51a8: It's okay, Snake. 
0x2da51cc: ...The truth is FOX-HOUND was already the subject of an undercover investigation.
0x2da5230: Meryl was transferred to this base just before the terrorist attack...
0x2da5288: ...as a way of manipulating me.

0x30c418c: Those bastards...
0x30c41b0: I'm sorry.
0x30c41cc: They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.
0x30c4214: You'd better get out of there, Snake.
0x30c424c: Are you sure?
0x30c426c: ...It'll be bad for you.
0x30c4298: Don't worry.
0x30c42b8: It's the least I can do for you after all the lies.
0x30c42fc: Colonel...
0x30c4318: I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run.
0x30c4358: After that there's no turning back...
0x30c4390: Aaaah! What are you doing!?
0x30c43bc: Snake!
0x30c43d4: Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel!?
0x30c4410: ...I don't believe it!!
0x30c4438: What happened!?
0x30c4458: Snake, the Colonel...!!

0x3204c14: Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty.
0x3204c4c: This is the Secretary of Defense, Jim Houseman.
0x3204c8c: Put the Colonel back on!
0x3204cb8: He's been placed under arrest for leaking top-secret information and for the crime of high treason.
0x3204d2c: Ridiculous!
0x3204d48: Yes, he's a ridiculous man.
0x3204d74: He truly believed that he was in command of this operation.
0x3204dc0: You bastard...!
0x3204de0: There won't be a speck of evidence left.
0x3204e1c: I'm sure the President would want the same thing.
0x3204e60: The President ordered this?
0x3204e8c: The President is a busy man.
0x3204ebc: I have complete authority here.
0x3204eec: How do you plan on explaining a nuclear attack on Alaska to the media?
0x3204f44: Don't worry.
0x3204f64: We've prepared a convincing cover story.
0x3204fa0: We'll simply say that the terrorists exploded a nuclear device.
0x3204ff0: ...Smart.
0x320500c: You'll be murdering everyone here. The scientists, the Genome Army, everyone...
0x320506c: Donald...
0x3205088: ...the DARPA Chief is already dead...
0x32050c0: So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA Chief after all?
0x3205108: He was my friend.
0x320512c: And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh?
0x3205180: Well, if you give me the optic disc, I might consider saving them.
0x32051d4: What are you talking about?
0x3205200: Metal Gear's test data!
0x3205228: Donald was supposed to bring it back.
0x3205260: I don't have it.
0x3205284: I see. Oh well that's okay...
0x32052b4: You two are an embarrassment from the 1970's.
0x32052f4: ...our country's dirty little secret.
0x320532c: ...our country's dirty little secret.
0x3205364: Well, the bombs will be dropping soon, and you two have a lot of catching up to do.
0x32053c8: Farewell.

0x360c064: Have at you, Snake!
0x3611070: If you win...
0x3611090: you might still be able to save her.
0x361d87c: You could enjoy one brief moment of love...
0x361d8bc: before the end.
0x361f102: !!
0x362f890: If you cross this line,
0x362f8b8: you'll fall.
0x362f8d8: At this height,
0x362f8f8: it will kill even you.

0x3647868: You're out of time!
0x364e86c: Better hurry!
0x364e88c: It's going to blow!!
0x364f5ad:  !!!!
0x3658068: Look!
0x3658080: There's no time!
0x3660868: You're out of time!!
0x366a868: What's wrong, Snake!
0x367b360: Snake, it's me.
0x367b380: Otacon, good news!
0x367b3a4: Meryl's okay.
0x367b3c4: All right!!!
0x367b3e4: You saved her, man. Good job!
0x367b414: I got some bad news too.
0x367b440: We're about to be bombed.
0x367b46c: Oh boy. I guess we're considered expendable.
0x367b4ac: Is there a way out of here?
0x367b4d8: A way out?
0x367b4f4: ...Uh, yeah.
0x367b514: You can take the loading tunnel to the surface.
0x367b554: There's a parking garage right next to you.
0x367b590: The tunnel leads from there to the surface.
0x367b5cc: The door in front?
0x367b5f0: No. It's a small entrance to the west of that door.
0x367b634: How about the security?
0x367b65c: I just unlocked it.
0x367b680: Who do you think you're talking to?
0x367b6b4: I'll take care of security along your escape route too...
0x367b700: What are you going to do?
0x367b72c: Me?
0x367b740: I...
0x367b758: I'll stay here.
0x367b778: Are you crazy!
0x367b798: I need a little more time to take care of your escape route.
0x367b7e8: But...
0x367b800: Unlocking the security doors is difficult work.Only I can do it.
0x367b854: Otacon?
0x367b86c: Don't worry.
0x367b88c: I'm staying here.It's my own decision.
0x367b8c4: Otacon, this is a hardened shelter, but they're going to use a surface piercing nuclear bomb.
0x367b934: It won't hold.
0x367b954: I'm through regretting the past...
0x367b988: Life isn't all about loss, y'know...
0x367b9c0: ..........
0x367b9dc: Snake, I'm a complete person now.
0x367ba10: I've found a reason to live.
0x367ba40: Good.
0x367ba58: Don't die on me.
0x367ba7c: Same to you.
0x367ba9c: Take care of Meryl, okay.
0x367bac8: I will...
0x367bae4: Okay I gotta go.
0x367bb08: I promise I'll do something about your escape route.
0x367bb50: Thanks.

0x39de271: "Thanks"...
0x39de290: ...oh, that sounds nice.
0x39de2bc: ...I believe in you.
0x39de2e4: Thanks, Snake.

0x3a2c860: I'll take the wheel!
0x3a30860: Let me drive!

0x3a34064: Uh oh, no key.
0x3a39864: Oh no. No key.

0x3a3e868: It's got keys.
0x3a3e888: Let's go!
0x3a45064: All right, keys.

0x3a4a86c: Snake, climb in! Let's go!!
0x3a51864: Snake, it's started! Get in!!
0x3a57864: Snake, hurry. Get in!

0x3a5d868: Snake, hurry! Get in!
0x3a64064: Snake, hang on!
0x3a6a060: Snake, hang on!!

0x3a6e85c: Here they come!!
0x3a71864: Snake, it's a check point.

0x3a77864: It's a check point, Snake.

0x3a82064: Alright! Here we go!!

0x3a87868: Yeah! Snake, we made it!!

0x3a94860: Snake!!

0x3a98060: Snake!!
0x3a9b864: Snake, check point!

0x3aa0060: Another check point.

0x3aa4860: You did it, Snake!!
0x3aa8864: You did it! Snake!

0x3aad060: Snake!!

0x3ab5870: Not yet, Snake!
0x3ab5890: It's not over yet!

0x3ac305c: Liquid!!

0x3ace064: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

0x3ad3864: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
0x3ad9864: Snake, look! Daylight!

0x3adf064: Look, Snake! Daylight!

0x3ae485c: Hold on!!
0x3ae8060: We're gonna crash!!
0x3aed854: Yes sir. The entire unit was wiped out.
0x3aed890: Those two are still alive.
0x3aed8bc: The vector?
0x3aed8d8: Yes sir,
0x3aed8f4: FoxDie should become activated soon...
0x3aed92c: Right on schedule.
0x3aed950: Yes, sir.
0x3aed96c: I recovered all of Rex's dummy warhead data.
0x3aed9ac: ...No, sir. My cover is intact.
0x3aed9dc: Nobody knows who I really am.
0x3aeda0c: Yes, the DARPA Chief knew my identity,
0x3aeda44: but he's been disposed of.

0x3b51054: Yes.
0x3b5106c: The inferior one was the winner after all.
0x3b510a8: ...That's right.
0x3b510cc: Until the very end,
0x3b510f0: Liquid thought he was the inferior one.
0x3b51128: Yes, sir. I agree completely.
0x3b51158: It takes a well-balanced individual...
0x3b51190: such as yourself to rule the world.
0x3b511c8: No, sir. 
0x3b511e4: No one knows that you were the third one...
0x3b51224: Solidus.
0x3b51240: ...What should I do about the woman?
0x3b51278: Yes sir. I'll keep her under surveillance.

0x3bc4054: Yes. Thank you.
0x3bc4074: Good-bye.
0x3bc4090: Mr. President.

0x3bf49e8: Snake, can you hear me?
0x3bf4a10: Colonel!
0x3bf4a2c: Are you okay?
0x3bf4a4c: Colonel, what happened?
0x3bf4a74: The Secretary of Defense has been arrested.
0x3bf4ab0: Early retirement.
0x3bf4ad4: Arrested?
0x3bf4af0: I was able to get into contact with the President.
0x3bf4b34: Metal Gear, the training exercise...all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.
0x3bf4ba8: Acting alone?
0x3bf4bc8: What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?
0x3bf4c10: The orders were rescinded.
0x3bf4c3c: The F117s and the B2 Spirits have returned to the base.
0x3bf4c84: Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.
0x3bf4cd0: I see...
0x3bf4cec: Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few secrets.
0x3bf4d44: I wonder about that.
0x3bf4d6c: In any case, the danger's over...
0x3bf4da0: Thanks, Snake.

0x3db3b68: Colonel, about Meryl...
0x3db3b90: I already know...
0x3db3bb4: ..........
0x3db3bd0: Colonel?
0x3db3bec: Meryl was...
0x3db3c0c: ...my daughter.
0x3db3c2c: What?
0x3db3c44: I didn't find out until recently.
0x3db3c78: I got a letter from her mother...my dead brother's wife...
0x3db3cc4: I was going to tell her after this operation was over.
0x3db3d0c: Colonel, I...
0x3db3d2c: It's okay, Snake.
0x3db3d50: Thanks, anyway.
0x3db3d70: Snake,
0x3db3d88: I'm sorry I 
0x3db3da8: I kept a lot of things from you.
0x3db3ddc: It's okay, Colonel.
0x3db3e00: Snake, I'm not a Colonel.
0x3db3e2c: Oh that's right.
0x3db3e50: I've got a present for you.
0x3db3e7c: There's a snowmobile close to you.
0x3db3eb0: Mei Ling saw it on the satellite photos.
0x3db3eec: This time of the year the glaciers are pretty calm.
0x3db3f30: You should be able to ride right out of there.
0x3db3f70: I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you to come home alive.
0x3db3fd0: Me neither.
0x3db3fec: I better not show my face around there.
0x3db4024: No danger of that.
0x3db4048: You two officially died after your jeep sank into the ocean...
0x3db4098: That's not too far from the truth.
0x3db40cc: Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.
0x3db4118: Okay, Roy.
0x3db4134: Are you going to be okay?
0x3db4160: Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy.
0x3db419c: ...a hard copy of all Mei Ling's data.
0x3db41d4: As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling will be fine.
0x3db4224: The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon.
0x3db426c: They won't be able to follow us.
0x3db42a0: I guess we won't meet again.
0x3db42d0: Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.
0x3db430c: Really? I'll look forward to that.
0x3db4340: Roy, just tell me one thing.

0x41a6be4: What?
0x41a6bfc: About Fox Die.
0x41a6c1c: What about me?
0x41a6c3c: It killed Liquid...
0x41a6c60: Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.
0x41a6cb4: How is she?
0x41a6cd0: Don't worry.
0x41a6cf0: Mei Ling's with her right now.
0x41a6d20: I'm switching over to Naomi.

0x4243288: Snake, it's me...
0x42432ac: Naomi...
0x42432c8: I heard...about my brother...
0x42432f8: I'm sorry...
0x4243318: but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.
0x4243374: He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your own life.
0x42433d0: Frankie said that?
0x42433f4: Yeah. He also said he'll always love you...
0x4243430: Naomi, your brother just saved you, me and the whole world.
0x424347c: He fought with every ounce of strength in his body.
0x42434c0: Maybe..
0x42434d8: ...maybe now he's finally found some peace.
0x4243514: He wasn't really my brother anymore...
0x424354c: Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar he's been like a ghost.
0x42435a0: A ghost looking for a place to die...
0x42435d8: Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too.
0x4243610: What about me?
0x4243630: When am I gonna go?
0x4243654: That's up to you.
0x4243678: What do you mean?
0x424369c: Everybody dies when their time's up...
0x42436d4: Yeah, so when's mine up?
0x4243700: It's up to you how you use the time left to you.
0x4243744: Live, Snake.
0x4243764: That's all I can say to you.
0x4243794: ..........

0x4592218: Snake, can you hear me?
0x4592240: Colonel!
0x459225c: Are you okay?
0x459227c: Colonel, what happened?
0x45922a4: The Secretary of Defense has been arrested.
0x45922e0: Early retirement.
0x4592304: Arrested?
0x4592320: I was able to get into contact with the President.
0x4592364: Metal Gear, the training exercise...all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.
0x45923d8: Acting alone?
0x45923f8: What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?
0x4592440: The orders were rescinded.
0x459246c: The F117s and the B2 Spirits have returned to the base.
0x45924b4: Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.
0x4592500: I see...
0x459251c: Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few secrets.
0x4592574: I wonder about that.
0x459259c: In any case, the danger's over...
0x45925d0: Thanks, Snake.
0x45925f0: Colonel, you can rest easy.
0x459261c: Meryl's fine.
0x459263c: Really?
0x4592654: Thanks...
0x4592670: ...Thank you, Snake.

0x47b3388: Snake,
0x47b33a0: I'm sorry I
0x47b33bc: I kept a lot of things from you.
0x47b33f0: It's okay, Colonel.
0x47b3414: Snake,
0x47b342c: I'm not a Colonel.
0x47b3450: Oh that's right.
0x47b3474: I've got a present for you.
0x47b34a0: There's a snowmobile close to you.
0x47b34d4: Mei Ling saw it on the satellite photos.
0x47b3510: This time of the year the glaciers are pretty calm.
0x47b3554: You should be able to ride right out of there.
0x47b3594: I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you to come home alive.
0x47b35f4: Me neither.
0x47b3610: I better not show my face around there.
0x47b3648: No danger of that.
0x47b366c: You two officially died after your jeep sank into the ocean...
0x47b36bc: That's not too far from the truth.
0x47b36f0: Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.
0x47b373c: Dr. Hal Emmerich should be somewhere on the base.
0x47b3780: I want someone to bring him in.
0x47b37b0: I understand.
0x47b37d0: Leave it to me.
0x47b37f0: Okay, Roy.
0x47b380c: Are you going to be okay?
0x47b3838: Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy.
0x47b3874: ...a hard copy of all Mei Ling's data.
0x47b38ac: As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling will be fine.
0x47b38fc: The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon.
0x47b3944: They won't be able to follow us.
0x47b3978: I guess we won't meet again.
0x47b39a8: Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.
0x47b39e4: Really? I'll look forward to that.
0x47b3a18: Roy, just tell me one thing.
0x47b3a48: What?
0x47b3a60: About Fox Die.
0x47b3a80: Meryl will be fine.
0x47b3aa4: She wasn't included in its programming.
0x47b3adc: What about me?
0x47b3afc: It killed Liquid...
0x47b3b20: Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.
0x47b3b74: How is she?

0x4b342d0: Don't worry.
0x4b342f0: Mei Ling's with her right now.
0x4b34320: I'm switching over to Naomi.

0x4b64890: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas. It represents one breath.

0x4b7b880: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.

0x4b8b0c8: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0x4b8b12c: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.

0x4bb70ec: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0x4bb7168: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0x4bb71c0: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.

0x4be8880: Snake, they're using a searchlight to sweep the area. Make sure you stay out of the beam.

0x4bf888c: There's no turning back now, Snake. You've got a job to do and you're our only hope. The world is counting on you.
,
0x4c0e07c: It looks like a cargo truck.
0x4c0e0ac: They must use it for transporting goods around the base.

0x4c1c894: Snake, why don't you try to hide in the truck? If you disguise yourself as part of the cargo, you might be able to use the truck to get around.

0x4c35080: Snake, you'll never be able to get through the front door. Find some other way to get in.

0x4c45890: That base must have some kind of ventilation system to recirculate the air. There should be air ducts around there somewhere.

0x4c5c0b4: They must need a lot of power to run the base. There's probably a diesel generator somewhere.
0x4c5c124: And since generating electricity requires oxygen, there must be exhaust openings for that too.

0x4c8207c: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.

0x4c91880: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.

0x4ca307c: Don't make too much noise or you'll be spotted. Be careful when you're walking on that floor.

0x4cb288c: Even though the Genome Soldiers are strengthened by gene therapy, they still need to sleep. You can move safely while they're napping.

0x4cc989c: The Genome Soldiers were specially trained so they can enter into a light sleep any time and still remain in attack posture.
0x4cc992c: Be careful not to make noise when you're near them.

0x4ce408c: When they're yawning, their eyes are closed, so they shouldn't be able to see you. Be careful with your timing and you'll be okay.

0x4cf909c: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha. Her frequency is 141.52.

0x4d15070: Her frequency is 141.52.

0x4d1f890: You can only open the door with a security card that's got the same or a higher security  clearance than the door.

0x4d350a8: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0x4d350e4: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0x4d35110: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.

0x4d500a0: Snake, there are gun cameras set up there. If they detect you, they'll open fire.
0x4d50104: Stay out of the cameras' field of vision. You could also try to jam them with Chaff.

0x4d6d880: It looks like the place is protected by infrared sensors. Somehow you'll have to make it past the beams.

0x4d7e894: Snake. Be careful. There are trap doors near there and the fall will kill you. Stay close up against the wall and you should be okay.

0x4d97078: You should be able to see where the trap doors are if you use your Thermal Goggles.

0x4da4988: Are you smoking?
0x4da49ac: Yeah, so what?
0x4da49cc: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0x4da4a38: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE) and
0x4da4aac: attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0x4da4b0c: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0x4da4b90: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.

0x4e0987c: Hmm. It looks like the infrared sensors that were set up here have been switched off.

0x4e18094: A mine field, huh. Don't forget to use your mine detector.
0x4e180e0: When you find out where a mine is, crawl forward and try to recover it.

0x4e31070: Snake, never use your weapon on that floor.

0x4e3b8bc: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0x4e3b8f0: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your life gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0x4e3b968: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.

0x4e62198: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0x4e621fc: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0x4e62280: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0x4e62300: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0x4e623a0: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0x4e62428: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0x4e624a8: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!

0x4edd868: Try to find a Gas Mask.

0x4ee4084: Snake, be careful. You won't be able to control your missile in an area with electronic jamming.

0x4ef5888: Snake, if you go up or down a ladder, just press the action button by the ladder.

0x4f079f0: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0x4f07a34: Diazepam?
0x4f07a50: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0x4f07af0: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0x4f07b30: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0x4f07bb0: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0x4f07c18: I see.
0x4f07c30: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0x4f07cb4: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0x4f07d34: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.

0x4f93864: I am a scientist.

0x4f990a0: Be careful. Wolves have the advantage in the dark. Not only can they see better, but they have a keen sense of smell as well.
0x4f99130: You'd better use your Night-Vision Goggles.

0x4fb7070: Ask Dr. Emmerich where the Night-Vision Goggles are.

0x4fc0884: If the Remote Controlled Missile goes too far away, you'll lose control over it. Be careful.

0x4fd2078: Colonel, listen to me. I found a parachute near the wreckage of the Hind.

0x4fdf16c: A parachute? You don't think that Liquid survived....?
0x4fdf1b4: Impossible. As soon as he jumped out of the pilot's seat, he'd be sliced up faster than an onion on an infomercial.
0x4fdf238: ...So what's that parachute doing there then?
0x4fdf278: I have no idea.
0x4fdf298: A trap?
0x4fdf2b0: Either that or a message...to me.
0x4fdf2e4: ...Meaning "I'm not dead", I suppose...
0x4fdf320: Maybe...but I think it's more like "I'll string you up!".
0x4fdf36c: ..........
0x4fdf388: Well, in any case, don't let your guard down.
0x4fdf3c8: I won't.

0x503c0d8: Snake, look at your C-rations. They're frozen. You can't use frozen C-rats.
0x503c134: Until they defrost, you won't be able to replenish your energy. Be very careful.
0x503c198: They'll defrost in a warm place. Probably just your bare skin would be fine.

0x5068150: We shouldn't have turned our backs on the Kurds after the Gulf War...
0x50681a8: Listen. We're not responsible for her choices. Everyone decides their own fate, no matter where they were born.
0x5068228: Words like fate, karma...it's just an excuse for giving up if you ask me....
0x5068288: I don't agree with you.
0x50682b0: Maybe if she hadn't been born on a battlefield, she might have had a happier, more fulfilling life. She might not have turned into a killer...
0x5068350: ..........

0x50ba88c: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base! The entrance should be towards the back of the Snowfield.

0x50ce8f0: Snake, that's a blast furnace.
0x50ce920: A blast furnace? What do they use that for?
0x50ce95c: There's no airport on the base, so it's hard to bring in supplies.
0x50ce9b0: They must have built a blast furnace so they could make building materials and such.
0x50cea18: That makes sense. Whew, I'm starting to sweat. It's getting kind of warm.

0x5106090: The entrance to the underground base is further below.
0x51060d8: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there. Try to find it.

0x511c87c: The elevator to the underground base was in the northeast of the bottom floor. Right, Snake?

0x512b0b0: Colonel, there's an elevator, but it's stuck on a floor below.
0x512b100: That elevator  can probably only be moved from below.
0x512b148: There must be some other way down. Look around.

0x5149070: Dr. Emmerich knows the base well. Why don't you ask him?

0x5153098: Watch out for the steam. It's dangerous. Use your First Person View Mode to see where the steam is coming out and then avoid it.

0x516c074: Yeah. I like a sauna now and then, but this is too much.

0x5178080: Snake, isn't that the elevator that goes down to Metal Gear's underground base?
0x517d501: ,.?
0x5188094: Yeah, but there's no button for calling the elevator.
0x51880dc: Maybe it'll come if you wait.
0x518810c: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?

0x519c084: Snake, blow away all the bad guys or you're not going to be able to get out of there and get to the underground base.

0x51ae070: Metal Gear is straight down. Better move it!

0x51b8128: There's no time. The terrorists are ready to launch.
0x51b8170: Negotiations are all finished?
0x51b81a0: The government can't cave in to terrorist's demands.
0x51b81e8: But they're threatening to launch a nuclear weapon!
0x51b822c: They've made their final decision.
0x51b8260: ...Why is the White House being so inflexible?
0x51b82a0: ..........
0x51b82bc: Colonel, is there still something you're hiding from me?
0x51b8308: Snake, please...just concentrate on stopping them, okay?

0x51fe880: It looks like that elevator you were riding on won't go any further down. Switch to the other elevator.

0x520f074: Snake, take that elevator all the way down to the underground base.

0x521b098: Colonel, where's Naomi?
0x521b0c0: I'm right here, Snake. What is it?
0x521b0f4: Oh...uh...nothing. Forget it.
0x521b124: Strange...
0x5232084: ...Snake, by now those terrorists have finished their launch preparations. Stop wasting time!

0x524406c: Metal Gear's base is up ahead.

0x524c06c: Be careful, you're just recovering from a cold...

0x5254080: Snake, stop lollygagging around and get to Metal Gear's base. There's no time!

0x5265070: Snake, it's over 30 below outside...
0x526e070: ..........
0x526e08c: What's wrong?
0x526e0ac: Forget it, thanks.

0x527e870: Snake, we're not paying you to be a scarecrow y'know.

0x5288874: Poor things. Ravens are God's creatures too, Snake.

0x5294228: Vulcan Raven is half Native Alaskan American and half Inuit. He was raised as a shaman and they say he has supernatural powers.
0x52942b8: During the Cold War, he trained in Russia with the Bimpel, the Soviet special forces. 
0x5294320: In 1993, he was demoted by President Yeltsin following his coup d'etat. So he fled the country and became a mercenary.
0x52943a8: After that, he joined those rent-a-war bastards at "Outer Heaven Inc."
0x5294404: He stayed there until he joined us in Fox Hound, thanks to a strong recommendation from Revolver Ocelot.
0x5294480: That cannon he's holding is a 20 millimeter Vulcan gun. You usually see them mounted on fighter planes.
0x52944f8: You can't take him on in a fire fight. He'll make mincemeat of you.
0x529454c: He's not just strong, Snake. He's a graduate emeritus from Alaska University, so he's a quick thinker, too.
0x52945c8: In any case, you'd better not try to attack him from the front.
0x5294618: Normal weapons are no match for his 20 millimeter Vulcan. Try to attack him from the sides or behind.

0x53370ec: You're at a disadvantage in a frontal assault.
0x533712c: Try attacking him with a Remote-Controlled Missile. Maneuver it between the containers to get it to come up behind him.
0x53371b4: But if you fly the missiles too slow, they'll get shot down even if they approach him from behind.
0x5337228: Try to get them close by flying them at top speed, or by maneuvering them around corners.

0x537287c: When the containers get destroyed, they'll block your way. Try to take him out before that happens.

0x538208c: You could also try to predict where he's gonna move and set up some C-4. If your timing is good, it might work.

0x5396130: Snake, if it's about Naomi, I'm looking into the matter right now. Give me a little more time.
0x53961a0: Where is she?
0x53961c0: She's still sleeping.
0x53961e8: I can't believe it... First, the DARPA Chief turns out to be an imposter and now Naomi...What the hell is going on here? 
0x5396274: I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know anything, right?
0x53962c8: I'm sorry, Snake.
0x53962ec: A madman is threatening the world with a nuclear weapon. I guess that's what I should worry about now...

0x53e387c: Snake, stop that launch. Head for the Control Room in the underground base.

0x53f1874: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the underground base, isn't it?

0x53fd064: Give Dr. Emmerich a call.

0x5402860: There's no time!

0x5407088: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base. It's north of the warehouse where you fought Raven.

0x5419884: Snake, that water is contaminated with nuclear waste material. If you go in there, you'll take damage.

0x542b8a0: Nuclear waste?
0x542b8c0: They were extremely careless with their handling of nuclear materials. Nastasha knows all about that if you want more info.

0x5443084: Snake, we don't need a rat trap. We need someone to stop that godamn nuke from getting launched!

0x545588c: Snake, is killing rats really that fun? Torturing small animals is a sign of a warped mind, you know.

0x546a094: Snake, they've input both detonation codes. The only way to stop the launch now is to use the card key to re-input the codes.

0x5482090: Snake, get that card key back from the rat. Why don't you watch its route and set up a trap for it with the C4 or something.

0x5499070: Find that card key! It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch!
0x54a3864: Use your Mine Detector.
0x54a80a4: Mine Detector?
0x54a80c4: Yes. The Mine Detector works just like a metal detector. The position of the card key should show up on your radar screen.

0x54c2098: You got the card key...good. Now get back to the Control Room and use that key to re-input the PAL codes. Stop that launch!

0x54db878: Snake, the card key changed shape. That's no good. Change it back.

0x54e9080: Snake, the surveillance camera... When you insert the card key, don't let it see you.

0x54f9064: Try using your Chaff.

0x54fe068: You could probably use a Box too.

0x5504868: Snake, re-input the PAL codes.

0x550c078: You've got to lower that card key's temperature. Find someplace cold!
0x5519078: Good. The card key changed shape. Hurry up to the control room, Snake!

0x5526080: Snake, look at the card key. It changed to its original shape. You'll have to change it again.

0x5538080: Snake, don't warm that card key. Cool it down. Find someplace cool.
.
0x5548070: Now you've got to warm the key up. Find someplace hot!
0x5553080: What about Naomi?
0x55530a4: Sorry, Snake...I'm still investigating.

0x5560074: You did it. That's the last one! Hurry to the Control Room!

0x556b884: Snake, what are you doing? You're supposed to warm it, not cool it. Look for a warm place.

0x557c8c4: Colonel, what's new with Naomi?
0x557c8f4: She's being interrogated, Snake. Leave her to me. You just worry about stopping Metal Gear.
0x557c960: ..........
0x557c97c: Please, Snake.
0x557c99c: Snake, I consider you my friend. Please believe that.
0x557c9e4: ..........

0x55a7878: Snake, we're just about out of time! Get to the Control Room!

0x55b4868: Snake, gas! Do something!
0x55bc078: Snake! Call Emmerich! He should be able to break through security!

0x55c8078: Snake, Emmerich will be able to open the door. Just trust him and hang on!

0x55d5070: Snake, what are you doing? Go after Liquid!

0x55df078: What the hell are you doing, Snake!? You've got to stop Metal Gear!

0x55ec0b8: God help us! Metal Gear is moving...
0x55ec0f0: Snake, it's all riding on you now. You've got to stop that thing!
0x55ec144: But how?
0x55ec160: You'll have to ask Dr. Emmerich, the guy who made it.

0x560e870: Destroy Metal Gear! We're out of time!
0x56190bc: If you can't do it, I'll have to resort to my last option.
0x5619108: Last option?
0x5619128: We have a submarine prepared to deliver a full nuclear strike on the base.
0x5619184: What the hell!?

0x563a998: Colonel, Fox is dead...
0x563a9c0: I know.....God rest his soul.
0x563a9f0: Even a soldier needs more to live for than just fighting. Maybe if had found something else, he wouldn't have been so haunted...
0x563aa84: He was too simple...too pure. There was nothing in this world for him to believe in...so he chose to believe only in himself.
0x563ab14: I guess you're right. A man like Fox is really only looking for his death...
0x563ab74: Yeah. But if you ask me, there's no happiness to be gained in death... no peace either.
0x563abdc: I'm gonna leave here alive.
0x563ac08: Good. I want that too.

0x56b608c: If you can shoot a Stinger missile directly into the cockpit, maybe you can destroy it. C'mon, Snake! Win!

0x56cc0a0: Snake, great job! You stopped Metal Gear...
0x56cc0dc: No...it's not time to celebrate yet. I can't move.

0x56e5070: Snake, can you turn your neck? Take a look around.

0x56f0060: What can I do for you, Snake?
0x56f4860: What is it, Snake?
0x56f8060: You called, Snake?
0x56fc060: What's up, Snake?
0x56ff860: Snake, are you okay?
0x5704060: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x5708864: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x570e060: Snake...
0x5711864: How can I help, Snake?

0x571686c: Snake, just tell me. I'll do anything to help.

0x571f868: Snake, how are you holding up?
0x5726860: Did you call, Snake?

0x572b060: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x572f860: Good luck, Snake.

0x5733860: Be careful, Snake.

0x5737870: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.

0x5741064: Don't give up, Snake!
0x5746068: C'mon Snake. You can do it!

0x574c864: Win Snake! Win!
0x5752064: Don't die, Snake!

0x5757864: Do it for me Snake!
0x575d068: Please Snake, don't give up.

0x5763868: Come back alive, Snake...

0x576a868: Snake, it's all up to you...

0x5771060: Don't give up!
0x577505c: Don't die...
0x5778064: Be careful, Snake.
0x577d074: Sorry. The Soliton radar won't work in a narrow space.

0x57890a4: Too much harmonic resonance. The radio waves produce interference and we can't analyze the topographic data.
0x5789124: Try to hang on until you get to a more open space. Okay?

0x57a809c: Snake, you can't use your radar in that area. There's some kind of electronic jamming coming from there...I wonder what it is. Anyway, be careful.

0x57c5058: ..........
0x57cf8b8: Snake, your Soliton radar...
0x57cf8e8: I know. I can't use it in a narrow space like this, right?
0x57cf934: Right. I'm sorry.
0x57cf958: No reason to apologize. Even the greatest masterpiece has its flaws.

0x57f08c8: Mei Ling, how's Naomi?
0x57f08f0: Huh? She's fine, I guess. What's up?
0x57f0928: Oh...
0x57f0940: What do you want, Snake? If you want to talk to Naomi, why don't you call her?
0x57f09a0: Oh it's nothing...forget about it.
0x57f09d4:  Strange guy...

0x58198b8: ...Naomi wasn't acting strangely or anything?
0x58198f8: No...I just can't believe that Naomi's an enemy spy. I refuse to accept that.
0x5819958: I don't want to believe it either, but...
0x5819994: Don't say it, Snake.

0x583a0c8: Snake, Naomi's under arrest...
0x583a0f8: What the hell is happening over there?
0x583a130: What's the Colonel thinking?
0x583a160: Campbell is...
0x583a180: I'm sorry. I can't say any more.
0x583a1b4: But please believe me. I'm here to help you. Until the end...

0x5862078: Snake, there's nothing I can do to help you. All I can do is to cheer you on!

0x587008c: Mei Ling, I don't think I can go through all that again. Please save the mission.
0x58700f0: Okay, Snake, I'll take care of it.

0x5882910: Snake, they've placed the Colonel under arrest. I don't know what I should do. This will probably be your last save.
0x5882998: I'm going to miss those proverbs of yours.
0x58829d4: Snake...
0x58829f0: Mei Ling, I have a favor to ask you.
0x5882a28: Make a hard copy of all the Codec conversation data up to this point. I want some insurance.
0x5882a98: Okay, Snake. Leave it to me.

0x594b068: Snake, please. Be safe...for me.

0x5953998: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said: "The graveyards are full of indispensable men."
0x5953a00: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0x5953a88: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0x5953adc: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0x5953b44: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0x5953bd8: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0x5953c40: Well...I'll think about it.

0x59c40cc: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said: "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x59c4140: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x59c4198: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x59f38dc: Snake, like Shakespeare said: "Nought's had, all's spent, Where our desire is got without content."
0x59f3954: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x59f39bc: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.

0x5a298c8: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath.". Do you know what that means?
0x5a29960: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.

0x5a560dc: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes."?
0x5a5613c: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x5a561b8: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?

0x5a8b8d0: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x5a8b968: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.

0x5abd8bc: Snake, like Confucius said: "The cautious seldom err."
0x5abd908: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.

0x5ae68bc: In China, they say: "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x5ae6918: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.

0x5b100d0: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns.".
0x5b10128: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x5b101a4: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.

0x5b4009c: There's a Chinese proverb: "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x5b400f8: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?

0x5b5b8dd: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still aflying, And this same flower, that smiles today, Tomorrow will be dying."
0x5b5b970: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x5b5b9a8: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?

0x5b920bc: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote: "Solitude sometimes is best society, And short retirement urges sweet return."
0x5b92140: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh.

0x5bbb8c1: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x5bbb944: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.

0x5be50c8: In China, they say: "Once the fox gets his nose in, He'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x5be5140: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.

0x5c108b9: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x5c10900: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x5c10974: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?

0x5c380c0: Snake, in China they say: "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals.".
0x5c38130: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x5c3819c: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?

0x5c618dc: In China, they say: "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly.".
0x5c61934: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x5c619c0: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... Believe in yourself!

0x5c988b8: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x5c98914: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x5c9898c: You should think about that, Snake.

0x5cc00bc: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x5cc0105: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd Give me my armor."
0x5cc015c: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!

0x5ce7899: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; Honor but an empty bubble."
0x5ce78ec: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?

0x5d018ac: Snake,"Come, what come may,Time and the hour runs through the roughest day".
0x5d0190c: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x5d01940: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.

0x5d238bd: "O, it is excellent  To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous  To use it like a giant."
0x5d23930: It's not right to use force to get someone to do what they don't want to do.
0x5d23990: That goes for countries too, don't you think?

0x5d4a8bd: "The tongues of dying men Enforce attention, like deep harmony."
0x5d4a910: Snake, people don't normally lie with their dying breaths. I think he was telling the truth. Maybe you should believe him.

0x5d728dc: In China they say "It's better to live ugly than to die beautiful".
0x5d72934: I think it's true. Once you're dead, you'll never have another chance to be happy. I can't understand people who want to die before their time.
0x5d729d4: Please Snake...promise me that you'll come back alive.

0x5da6944: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0x5da6998: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0x5da6a1c: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0x5da6a88: You're watching everything?
0x5da6ab4: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0x5da6b10: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0x5da6b5c: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.

0x5df80f8: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0x5df8154: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x5df81a8: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0x5df81f8: But you have no choice, Snake.
0x5df8228: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep  putting things in my pocket.

0x5e2f908: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0x5e2f94c: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0x5e2f991: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."
0x5e2f9ec: What's that supposed to mean?
0x5e2fa1c: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0x5e2fa98: Okay...but I'm not giving up.

0x5e6d9e8: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x5e6da20: Why do you ask?
0x5e6da40: I like to play fighting games.
0x5e6da70: Games?
0x5e6da88: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x5e6db30: Not a very good job, huh.
0x5e6db5c: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x5e6dbc4: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x5e6dc14: I'm sorry...
0x5e6dc34: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x5e6dc94: Okay, Snake...I understand. War's not a game.
0x5e6dcd4: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x5e6dd48: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.

0x5efd9a0: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x5efd9e4: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x5efda30: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x5efda78: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x5efdac0: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x5efdb54: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x5efdbb4: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x5efdc28: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x5efdc64: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.

0x5f701e0: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x5f70248: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x5f702b0: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x5f702e8: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x5f70344: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x5f703a4: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x5f70434: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x5f70474: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x5f704ec: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x5f70530: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x5f70598: You can say that again.

0x5ffb214: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0x5ffb254: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0x5ffb2b8: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0x5ffb330: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0x5ffb38c: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0x5ffb408: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0x5ffb448: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0x5ffb4ac: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0x5ffb508: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0x5ffb550: I don't know about that...
0x5ffb57c: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0x5ffb5ec: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0x5ffb628: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0x5ffb67c: And how do I do that?
0x5ffb6a4: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.

0x609e8ad: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x609e8f0: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x609e93c: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...

0x60c40c4: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0x60c40fc: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Hunter said?
0x60c415d: "He that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death." Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?

0x60f20b9: "Wise men ne'er sit and bewail their loss, but cheerly seek how to redress their harms."
0x60f2124: Snake, if you're lost and you don't know what to do, you should call Colonel Campbell. He might have a good suggestion for you.

0x6117898: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x61178f0: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.

0x6131088: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.

0x6143884: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?

0x6155878: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.

0x6161900: Get on your stomach. Fire from the prone position. It would be good if you had a tri pod or something stable to balance your weapon on.
0x6161998: If you don't have that, hold the weapon firmly under your armpit and keep it still with your chin. Line up your target in your scope's crosshairs.

0x619b898: Most soldiers can hit a target at 300 meters. I have a friend who can hit one at 520 meters.

0x61b30dc: To be a good sniper, you must have nerves of steel and lots of patience. Sometimes you have to sit in position for days, barely moving a muscle.
0x61b3180: The most important thing is to wait for your opportunity and then take it.

0x61e68c0: A slight tremor in your hand can cause you to miss a target 60 meters away by a half foot or more.
0x61e6934: Concentrate, hold your breath and try to stop your hand from moving.

0x6210134: The most important thing is to zero your rifle scope.
0x621017c: If you do not zero your sight correctly, you will never be able to hit your target.
0x62101e0: Your sight might be slightly off, so it would be a good idea to try a test shot. If it is off, you will have to take some lead for that when you shoot.
0x6210288: Don't worry. This was Sniper Wolf's rifle.
0x62102c4: Oh. In that case, you had better not mess with it.

0x625e8f0: At a distance of 400 meters, a one degree difference in air temperature will take you about 1 centimeter off your target.
0x625e97c: Atmospheric pressure will affect your shot in the same way. That is why you have to aim differently depending on the conditions.

0x62970dc: Have you ever heard of the Magnus Effect? Normally, a rifle bullet rotates and curves slightly to the right. That is called the Magnus Effect.
0x629717c: Think about comrade Magnus when you are lining up your crosshairs.

0x62cba30: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x62cbaac: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x62cbaf8: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x62cbb44: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x62cbbc8: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x62cbc30: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x62cbc98: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x62cbd18: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x62cbd9c: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x62cbdec: It's ironic, isn't it?

0x636b908: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x636b954: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x636b9cc: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x636ba54: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.

0x63b10cc: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x63b1138: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x63b1184: We just don't have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.

0x63de958: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x63de9dc: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x63dea58: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x63dead8: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapons disposal facilities.

0x6441a3c: They were conducting exercises with this new Metal Gear prototype. Is that what the DARPA Chief said?
0x6441ab4: Yeah.
0x6441acc: What the hell...!?
0x6441af0: So you know about Metal Gear?
0x6441b20: Just rumors. I heard it is some kind of walking tank that can deliver an accurate nuclear strike from any terrain...mountains, deserts, swamps...
0x6441bc4: ...wherever. But you are the real expert on Metal Gear, aren't you Snake?
0x6441c20: Yeah, I guess I am. But what about the PAL system that the DARPA Chief  mentioned?
0x6441c84: It is a device attached to a nuclear weapon system to prevent the missile from being armed or launched.
0x6441cfc: Usually a secret detonation code or combination is necessary to launch the missile.
0x6441d60: According to the chief, there are two codes and the terrorists already know one of them.
0x6441dcc: The other code...if the terrorists find out that one too...
0x6441e18: Yeah... I've got to hurry and rescue President Baker...

0x64f48e8: PAL stands for "permissive action link." It's a safety system attached to nuclear missile systems.
0x64f4960: The missile cannot be fired without the insertion of a special electronic code.
0x64f49c0: But if the terrorists have found out the detonation codes, they can launch the missile anytime they want.

0x652e178: Is it possible to destroy the PAL system so that the missile can be fired even without inserting the detonation code?
0x652e200: I do not believe so.
0x652e228: It is set up so that the warhead will become automatically inactive if any attempt is made to remove, deactivate or destroy the PAL.
0x652e2c0: So unless the terrorists either learn the detonation codes or get their hands on the detonation code override keys,
0x652e344: ...there's no way they can launch...
0x652e37c: Do not be too sure. Any system can contain bugs or malfunctions. We cannot relax yet.

0x658f150: I do not know much about Metal Gear. Just the little I have heard.
0x658f1a4: I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in 1995 and then again in Zanzibar in 1999...
0x658f208: Both were Third World countries led by military regimes.
0x658f254: They secretly developed Metal Gear to increase their military and political power throughout the world.
0x658f2cc: But both were stopped by a lone hero...you, Solid Snake.
0x658f318: ..........
0x658f334: That was a long time ago....

0x65e71a4: All the ICBM silos are closely monitored by military satellites.
0x65e71f8: SLBM-equipped submarines can move secretly, but naturally they are limited to launching from the water.
0x65e7270: Finally, there are ALBMs which can be launched from aircraft. They allow for excellent mobility, but they are somewhat unreliable...
0x65e7308: Metal Gear was developed to solve all those problems.
0x65e7350: It can move freely over any terrain and independently launch a nuclear missile at any target in the world.
0x65e73cc: It completely changes the nature of the strategic arms race and destroys the delicate nuclear balance...It's a weapon to be feared, believe me.

0x6669174: The development of Metal Gear is a cynical attempt to consolidate and increase our military dominance...
0x66691f0: ...while at the same time maintaining the pretense of disarming ourselves.
0x666924c: Now that the SLCM zero option, allowing for the sneak inspections of submarines in international waters, has been concluded,
0x66692dc: ...the value of submarines as strategic weapons has been greatly diminished.
0x666933c: With Metal Gear, governments of the world will be able to avoid this type of inspection,
0x66693a8: ...and at the same time stay in compliance with international nuclear treaties.

0x66d7118: It is just like Baker said. We are facing increasing danger from stored nuclear materials.
0x66d7184: You see, there are three elements necessary in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
0x66d71e8: Nuclear materials, nuclear engineers, and manufacturing technology.
0x66d723c: All three of them can easily be acquired by either legal or illegal means. If you have enough money, that is.

0x6722118: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x6722168: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x67221d4: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x6722238: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.

0x676c8e4: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x676c970: That stands for "Material Unaccounted For".
0x676c9b0: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.

0x67a3104: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x67a3168: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x67a3204: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...

0x67e5970: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x67e5a00: They are big on the "nuclear deterrent" theory.
0x67e5a44: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x67e5adc: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...
0x67e5b64: ...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike. Those two probably feel that Metal Gear will further promote that security...

0x685211c: The right-wingers believe that as long as any country has nuclear weapons, they must have them as well.
0x6852194: That is why they will never be in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x68521fc: And with each new country that acquires nuclear capabilities, the need for maintaining that counterstrike threat increases.
0x6852288: As long as the nuclear deterrent policy continues, we'll never be rid of nuclear weapons...

0x689e280: The theory of nuclear deterrence was born during the Cold War, at a time of great suspicion between the US and the USSR.
0x689e30c: The great gulf between the ideologies of East and West caused a dramatic escalation in the arms race.
0x689e384: And this escalation of the arms race in turn fueled mutual distrust and fear between the world's two great superpowers.
0x689e40c: The last half of the 20th century was shaped by the policy of nuclear deterrence.
0x689e470: But the world has changed.
0x689e49c: The Cold War has ended and we are now living in a world where small, regional conflicts are breaking out all over.
0x689e520: Things are not so simple anymore, and the policy of nuclear deterrence is obsolete.
0x689e584: Most of these regional conflicts are the result of age old enmities between different ethnic groups and religions.
0x689e608: In those cases, the hatred often runs so deep that rationality is thrown out the window.
0x689e674: For people such as them, the fear of a counterstrike often means little and that is why the nuclear deterrence policy has lost much of its efficacy.
0x689e71c: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.

0x697912c: Snake, that is a nuclear warhead storage area.
0x697916c: Are all these filled with nuclear warheads?
0x69791a8: Yes. But their detonation mechanisms have been removed.
0x69791f0: So I don't have to worry about this island turning into a pile of smoking rubble?
0x6979254: No. But if the casing is damaged, they may be leaking nuclear materials. Please make sure you do not use your gun around there.

0x69bc9ac: Naturally, nuclear weapons contain plutonium.
0x69bc9ec: Most of the radiation emitted by plutonium isotopes consists of alpha rays.
0x69bca48: The ionization effects are strong, but if they are kept in containers there is no danger of exposure.
0x69bcac0: But if plutonium enters the body through breathing or other contact, it is quickly absorbed into the bones and internal organs.
0x69bcb50: After that, there is no way to remove it.
0x69bcb8c: Once that happens, the victim will be constantly exposed to it, and just one one-millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer.
0x69bcc20: That is why a plutonium leak is such a serious danger. Make sure you do not use your gun anywhere near there.

0x6a40964: Scientists are currently using gene therapy to try to create a microorganism capable of breaking down plutonium,
0x6a409e8: they have not yet had any success.
0x6a40a1c: The plutonium version of bio-remediation, huh.
0x6a40a5c: Instead of processing, what about reusing it? I thought that they were working on using dismantled plutonium for civilian applications.
0x6a40af4: For a time, it looked like there was going to be international cooperation for that,
0x6a40b5c: ...but unfortunately there was too much mutual suspicion, and it all fell apart.

0x6a9b0fc: The signing of START was a step in the right direction, but it created a flood of dismantled plutonium.
0x6a9b174: Disposing of that plutonium safely is now the biggest challenge facing the world.
0x6a9b1d8: Combustion in nuclear reactors, vitrification processing...lots of suggestions have been made,
0x6a9b248: no effective solutions have been found.

0x6ad9998: Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation...
0x6ad9a18: ...without ever exploding a nuclear device. Is that true?
0x6ad9a64: Yes, it's true. Since the establishment of DARHT, the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility,
0x6ad9ae0: ...and NIF, the National Ignition Facility early in the 21st century, there's been a wealth of data concerning nuclear fission and fusion.
0x6ad9b7c: There is  also much of data accumulated from the nuclear tests conducted over the last four decades.
0x6ad9bf4: With the processing speed of today's supercomputers, they can design a new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer simulations.

0x6b449c8: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they're doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x6b44a40: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x6b44ad8: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x6b44b30: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x6b44bd4: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x6b44c7c: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x6b44ce0: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.

0x6bd19d8: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x6bd1a4c: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x6bd1ad4: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x6bd1b58: ...but that's nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x6bd1ba0: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x6bd1c08: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear and other plasma weapons.
0x6bd1c98: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.

0x6c66a1c: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?
0x6c66a7c: That was the secret World War II project responsible for the creation of the first atomic bomb.
0x6c66aec: It had a huge budget, something like two billion dollars. They brought in 120,000 of the best and brightest scientists and engineers to work on it.
0x6c66b90: And we all know how that story ended.
0x6c66bc8: In July of 1945, they exploded the first nuclear device at Trinity, followed shortly after by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x6c66c50: Trinity...the world was changed forever that day. Scientists and researchers could no longer pretend that their hands were clean of blood.
0x6c66cec: Afterwards, the leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, said:
0x6c66d4d: "The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.".

0x6d181e0: When Dr. Emmerich designed the new Metal Gear prototype, he thought he was creating a mobile TMD system. He is a very naive man.
0x6d18274: TMD stands for "Theater Missile Defense".
0x6d182b0: They represent a shift in defense priorities from dealing with the threat of ICBMs from the former Soviet Union,
0x6d18334: ...to dealing with small scale regional conflicts in the Third World.
0x6d1838c: Current TMD systems work by a combination of THAADs, theater high altitude air defense, which intercept missiles outside of the atmosphere,
0x6d18428: and Patriot-type missiles which intercept missiles within the atmosphere.
0x6d18484: Dr. Emmerich was planning on them using Metal Gear as a low atmosphere mobile missile interceptor unit.

0x6db218c: There are many in Russia as well as America 
0x6db21cc: ...because they say that it undermines the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
0x6db2240: And there are also those who say that the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over from the Cold War.
0x6db22b4: They argue that the strategy of MAD (mutually assured destruction) should be maintained by limiting missile defense systems.
0x6db2344: There was a big debate over it, but ultimately, under pressure from the Defense Industry who was looking to expand into new markets,
0x6db23dc: TMD systems were accepted as an integral part of a modern military arsenal.

0x6e2b19c: So the terrorist's intentionally set their deadline to coincide with the signing of the START 3 Accord...
0x6e2b218: According to the terms of START 3,both Russia and the U.S. are to reduce the number 
0x6e2b280: of their nuclear warheads in deployment to between 2,000 and 2,500 missiles.
0x6e2b2e0: The current President has not yet had any major foreign policy successes.
0x6e2b33c: His term will be up soon and the word at the White House is that he desperately wants this one for the history books.
0x6e2b3c4: Typical politician...
0x6e2b3ec: It's a big concern for him and his supporters.

0x6e95a48: The signing of the START 3 was dependent on ratification of the START 2.
0x6e95aa4: But MIRVs were the most important weapon in Russian arsenal.
0x6e95af4: Naturally, the conservatives in the Russian Parliament were greatly opposed to disarming them.
0x6e95b64: The expansion of NATO, along with tension caused by disagreements
0x6e95bb8: ...the application of the ABM Treaty with regards to TMD systems made ratification in the 1990's difficult.
0x6e95c34: It took a tremendous amount of pressure and secret negotiations to get the Russians to sign the START 3 tomorrow.
0x6e95cb8: But the political situation in Russia is tenuous at best and one small incident could bring the signing to a crashing halt.
0x6e95d44: If the Russians learn that America has secretly developed a new type of nuclear weapon, there is no telling how they might react.
0x6e95dd8: World opinion will be strongly against us too.
0x6e95e18: That Liquid Snake is a smart one...he knows the political climate. His actions were obviously very well calculated...

0x6f56114: It's true that the signing of START 3 would mean a reduction in nuclear missiles,
0x6f56178: but it would still leave between 4,000 to 5,000 missiles between the US and Russia alone.
0x6f561e4: That is more than enough to destroy every living thing on this planet several times over.
0x6f56250: There's a big difference between nuclear reduction and nuclear elimination.

0x6f9f154: Negotiations for START 3 began in the late 1990's.
0x6f9f198: The Russian President had actually been pushing for a much more ambitious arms reduction pact, but it was rejected by the Americans.
0x6f9f230: America was the sole remaining superpower on the Earth and they were not too eager to give up the title.
0x6f9f2ac: The fact is in the history of the world, no dominant power has ever willingly given up the reigns of that power.
0x6f9f330: ...in the case of the US, that means nuclear superiority.

0x70010dc: There has been a lot of effort to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons,...
0x7001144: but even today, there is no treaty limiting tactical nuclear weapons.
0x700119c: It may look from the outside that the world is disarming, but in fact nuclear weapons are not going anywhere soon.

0x703489c: The Nuclear Age is not over yet. As long as one country in the world has nuclear weapons, they will never go away.

0x704f98c: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x704f9ec: it's going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x704fa80: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,
0x704fb18: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x704fbb8: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.

0x70c7258: There is no doubt about it. After the Cold War ended, the chance of a full-scale world-wide nuclear conflagration was diminished.
0x70c72ec: But on the other hand, the chances of local, tactical use of nuclear weapons greatly increased.
0x70c735c: Civil wars, revolutions, regional disputes...it seems like there is a new war popping up somewhere every day,
0x70c73dc: and many of them are the result of centuries-old hatred between different ethnic or religious groups.
0x70c7454: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x70c7498: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.
0x70c7520: A nuclear deterrent is meaningless because emotions run so hot.
0x70c7570: Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear missiles, the decision to use tactical nuclear missiles is in some cases left up to battlefield commanders.
0x70c7614: It is pretty scary.
0x70c7638: As long as nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the chances that someone is going to use them will also continue to grow...

0x718e900: Ironically, the policy of nuclear deterrence has prevented the elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x718e970: The entire basis for determining them to be illegal has been undermined by this military policy.
0x718e9e4: In other words, nuclear weapons cannot be declared illegal because we have an entrenched policy which makes them legal ipso facto.

0x71d017c: America and Russia are not the only countries with nuclear weapons.
0x71d01d0: During the Cold War, the UK, France and China publicly declared the existence of their own nuclear arsenals.
0x71d0250: Since we entered the 21st century,
0x71d0284: we have confirmed the existence of nuclear weapons programs in countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia.
0x71d031c: Nukes are steadily proliferating. The 21st century is paying for the 20th century's failure to plug the holes in the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)
0x71d03c0: and for the IAEA's failure to tighten nuclear control measures.

0x7243a58: The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was established in 1957 to oversee peaceful as well as military applications of atomic power.
0x7243af4: But the IAEA can only investigate those countries which request an investigation.
0x7243b58: Furthermore, the timing of the inspection must be approved by the country in question. They are not allowed to do sneak inspections.
0x7243bf0: The country that is being investigated can even dictate the nationality of the inspectors that they will allow in.
0x7243c74: In the late 1970's, Iraq would only allow inspectors from Bulgaria and Russia to enter the country.
0x7243ce8: The IAEA does not even have the authority to level fines against countries who have committed infractions.
0x7243d64: After the Gulf War, they discovered that Iraq had been developing nuclear weapons in secret right under the investigator's noses!
0x7243df8: Unfortunately, as an organization, the IAEA just did not have the teeth to effectively stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.

0x730ba04: In 1970, all five nuclear powers, America, the Soviet Union, France, England and China, signed the NPT.
0x730ba7c: The treaty provided that the non-nuclear equipped countries could receive assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear power.
0x730bb10: But military applications of nuclear power were strictly prohibited,
0x730bb68: and the IAEA was given the responsibility of investigating countries who were suspected of being in non-compliance with the NPT.
0x730bbfc: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x730bc58: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between
0x730bce4: ...which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.

0x73b2930: That stuff that is flowing in those ditches on the 1st floor must be radioactive nuclear waste water.
0x73b29a8: You had better stay away from it. You are already exposed enough just by being in that area. Any further exposure could be fatal.
0x73b2a3c: That place does not have a nuclear processing facility.
0x73b2a84: It must be some other kind of nuclear material that is leaking besides the dismantled nuclear warheads...
0x73b2b00: ...probably spent nuclear fuel or something.

0x74098fc: Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear reactor, it will always produce, as a waste product,
0x7409968: some spent-fuel mixed with highly toxic, radioactive compounds.
0x74099b8: Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive for 300 years. In other words, this material will remain lethal for the next three three centuries.

0x7449134: There was a time when we thought it was safe to seal the nuclear waste in special containers...
0x74491a4: and bury it in a layer of rock salt without much exposure to underground water.
0x7449204: Even though we now know there are big problems with that, we still don't have an effective disposal solution.
0x7449284: Most of the nuclear waste we produce is just shoved underground with no intention of ever processing it.
0x7449300: It is like an ostrich with its head in the sand. No?

0x749d9cc: There is a process which involves mixing the nuclear waste with low grade uranium to convert it into a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...
0x749da60: ...for burning in light water reactors, usually in the form of glass logs.
0x749dabc: But MOX contaminates a nuclear reactor more quickly than low grade uranium. It is also highly toxic.
0x749db34: It is economically unfeasible unless the price of uranium is more than four times what it currently is.
0x749dbac: Not only that, you cannot ignore the danger inherent in transporting the MOX from the processing factories to the nuclear reactors.
0x749dc40: An accident could lead to radioactive contamination or the materials could be hijacked by terrorists...
0x749dcb8: No, I do not think MOX could be called a viable solution to the problem of plutonium disposal.

0x752d200: There is only one effective use for nuclear waste.
0x752d244: Military applications. You see, after chemical reprocessing, they can separate plutonium from the nuclear waste.
0x752d2c8: Nuclear weapons normally use military grade plutonium 239 with a purity of 93-94%.
0x752d32c: It is made in special nuclear reactors designed for military applications.
0x752d388: On the other hand, the plutonium in spent nuclear fuel only has a purity of about 60%.
0x752d3f0: But that does not mean that spent nuclear fuel cannot be used for military applications.
0x752d45c: America has been successful in tests using weapons made from nuclear reactor grade plutonium.
0x752d4cc: That means that eventually everyone will be able to make nuclear weapons from plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel.

0x75d523c: Spent nuclear fuel can also be used to make depleted uranium (DU) bullets or shells. They are armor- piercing anti-tank rounds.
0x75d52cc: DU is two-and-a-half times denser than steel and 50% denser than lead, so it makes it an extremely effective armor-piercing weapon.
0x75d5360: It can cut through tank armor like a hot knife through butter.
0x75d53b0: Unfortunately, when a DU round explodes, it spreads a fine dust which, when absorbed into a body,
0x75d5424: supposedly causes terrible long-term health problems including genetic damage.
0x75d5484: During the Gulf War, American as well as Iraqi soldiers were exposed to DU dust and suffered from radiation poisoning and other illnesses.
0x75d5520: The American government conducted research to discover whether exposure could lead to cancer or genetic damage,
0x75d55a0: ...but the results were inconclusive.
0x75d55d8: Some people think that this type of radioactive contamination is what is behind the "Gulf War Syndrome",
0x75d5654: but the government will not admit it...

0x7692928: They are currently doing research to find ways to transform minor actinoids such as Americium and Neptunium,
0x76929a8: which are highly toxic with long half lives, into nuclear materials with short half lives.
0x7692a14: It's called extinction processing, but it's not being used much due to all the technical and economic problems with it.
0x7692a9c: A serious program for nuclear waste treatment has yet to be established.

0x76e2104: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x76e216c: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x76e21f4: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x76e2254: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.

0x7725898: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

0x77400a0: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x7740100: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.

0x775c0f4: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x775c160: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x775c1d0: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.

0x779a8b4: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!

0x77bf0e8: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x77bf160: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x77bf1c4: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.

0x77f8100: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x77f81a0: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x77f821c: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and dramatically.

0x783a930: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x783a98c: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x783aa24: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x783aa98: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.

0x788e3f0: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x788e47c: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x788e4f4: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x788e578: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x788e5ec: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x788e62c: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x788e694: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x788e6e4: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x788e750: You don't mean...
0x788e774: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x788e808: ..........
0x788e824: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x788e8a0: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x788e8e0: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x788e964: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x788e9c4: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x788ea18: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.

0x79e026c: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x79e02c4: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x79e0310: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x79e0360: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon system as well.
0x79e03cc: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x79e045c: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x79e04e0: You're a tough lady.
0x79e0508: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x79e0558: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x79e05b8: Unfortunately, all I can do from here IS provide you with information...
0x79e0614: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x79e06a0: Same here, Snake.

0x7a9714c: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x7a97190: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x7a971fc: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x7a9724c: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x7a972e8: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x7a97368: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.

0x7af80a8: Security cameras? Da. 
0x7af80d0: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff, you will be able to disable it.

0x7b19180: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x7b191e0: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x7b19274: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x7b192e4: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x7b19330: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x7b193a0: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.

0x7b8e89c: Snake, that room is set with infrared sensors. You should be able to see them if you had some smoke... cigarette smoke or something.

0x7baa93c: Sorry, but these are smokeless cigarettes.
0x7baa978: You mean those cigarettes that are designed to cut down on second- hand smoke?
0x7baa9d8: Oh well. don't worry... If you blow the smoke in the direction of the infra-red sensors, you should be able to see them.
0x7baaa64: That was a good idea bringing the cigarettes. But don't smoke too much. Cigarettes make you weak, in mind and body. They are bad for you.

0x7bf98bc: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x7bf9904: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?

0x7c20138: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x7c201c0: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or "sound and flash grenades".
0x7c2021c: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x7c20294: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.

0x7c77130: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x7c771c8: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x7c77200: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x7c7725c: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.

0x7cc9904: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x7cc99a4: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar. 
0x7cc9a04: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.

0x7d0d268: A cardboard box.
0x7d0d28c: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x7d0d31c: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x7d0d3a8: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x7d0d418: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x7d0d4b4: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like 
0x7d0d544: wood or something.
0x7d0d568: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x7d0d5d0: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x7d0d604: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.

0x7dbf0b8: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x7dbf118: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you.

0x7de51ac: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape in almost any way you want.
0x7de5234: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x7de5284: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x7de5300: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x7de533c: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x7de53c4: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x7de5418: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies, so be careful.

0x7e688ec: That is a FAMAS.
0x7e68910: It is a bullpup style assault rifle. It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x7e689b0: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a 25 round magazine in a few seconds.

0x7ea40d0: Snake, there are Gun Cameras somewhere around there. They'll open fire automatically if they detect you. Be careful.
0x7ea4158: You should be able to confuse their sensors briefly with your chaff. Get past them while they are disabled!

0x7ed3078: You could also destroy them with your Stinger missiles.

0x7edf864: That area is mined?
0x7ee506c: If you only had a Mine Detector...

0x7eee87c: After you locate the mines on your radar, crawl forward and retrieve them.

0x7efe150: Anti-personnel mines have killed over 20,000 non-combatants in the past thirty years.
0x7efe1b8: In countries like Cambodia and Nicaragua, the killing and maiming of innocent victims continues long after the wars have ended.
0x7efe248: It is easy to plant the mines, you see, but removing them is a different matter.
0x7efe2ac: It requires more time and manpower than anyone is willing to invest.
0x7efe304: The superpowers need to donate more mine detectors and other equipment to remove them. It is the least we could do after laying them.

0x7f5e168: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x7f5e194: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x7f5e1d8: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x7f5e250: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x7f5e2e0: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x7f5e350: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.

0x7fc70c0: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x7fc7118: It is designed to prevent bullets frompenetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.

0x7ff0144: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x7ff01b4: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x7ff01f4: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x7ff0284: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x7ff02e0: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.

0x804b108: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x804b180: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents,
0x804b204: you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is a Gas Mask.

0x808f100: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x808f15c: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x808f1d4: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.

0x80cf95c: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x80cf988:  That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful, unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x80cfa14: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being heard.
0x80cfa70: The outside is made of reinforced plastic and the inside is made from an acetate weave.
0x80cfad8: Also the eye pieces are specially treated so they won't fog up.
0x80cfb28: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.

0x8134978: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x81349c8: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x8134a54: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You'll be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x8134ad0: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x8134b2c: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Don't use them for too long a period of time.

0x81a4110: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x81a4188: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x81a4208: You will be able to spot claymores too.
0x81a4240: But they will tire your eyes out, so don't use them too much.

0x81eb880: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.

0x81fd0a4: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x81fd0cc: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering. 
0x81fd128: Maybe you should try the same thing.

0x821c17c: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x821c1d4: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x821c24c: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. It is best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x821c2e4: When you're shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x821c360: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.

0x828f144: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x828f1ec: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x828f22c: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.

0x82dd180: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x82dd1b4: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x82dd238: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x82dd284: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x82dd320: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x82dd364: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.

0x834f894: You have a good view, though your movement is limited...It might be a good place to take out your enemy with your PSG-1.

0x83678fc: It looks like, Raven's holding an M61A1 20 mm. multi-turreted machine gun. They're usually mounted on F16s.
0x8367978: With its 6 rotating turrets, it can fire 4000 20 mm. rounds per minute. And it's accurate, too.
0x83679e8: If you come at him from the front he will turn you into borscht.

0x83a6094: Stay out of his way. You have got to hide and attack. Try a Remote Controlled Missile or your C4 explosives.

0x83be938: Snake, I am detecting high levels of radiation coming from that waterfall. If you get too close you could be exposed.
0x83be9c0: Besides the dismantled warheads, Shadow Moses Island must also be storing some other kind of nuclear materials.
0x83bea40: Whatever it is, it must be leaking...
0x83bea78: You have probably heard it before, but I will tell you again. Most nuclear storage facilities aren't in much better shape than this one.
0x83beb14: They're causing immeasurable damage to the environment.

0x84160f8: I cannot believe it! Dr. Naomi working with the terrorists...
0x8416148: I don't want to believe it either.
0x841617c: But if what Colonel Campbell says is true...
0x84161bc: I know. Nastasha, have you ever heard of Fox Die?
0x8416200: Fox Die? No, sorry...I've never heard of it.
0x8416240: Oh well....Forget about it.

0x84528a0: Snake, forget about Dr. Naomi. Right now the most important thing you have to worry about is reinserting that PAL code.

0x846d904: Nastasha, I'm going to ask you one more time. Do you know anything about Fox Die and the real nature of this operation?
0x846d98c: Sorry. I have not been told anything about that.
0x846d9d0: That's funny. The Colonel said almost exactly the same thing.
0x846da20: ..........
0x846da3c: Sorry. I didn't mean to sound sarcastic. I believe you...

0x84ae088: Snake, you are in danger! Get out of there!
0x84ae0c4: Yeah but how?
0x84aea0a: ...

0x84be888: All you can do is wait for Dr. Emmerich to open the door. Stay alive, Snake.

0x84d1080: Isn't there someone who knows this base...?
0x84d10bc: Dr. Emmerich! Maybe he can do something.

0x84e1878: Snake, what are you doing? Go after Liquid!

0x84ee89c: I am a military analyst and an expert on high tech weapons, but I do not know anything about Metal Gear.
0x84ee918: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?

0x850a0a0: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x850a100: If you use chaff, you should be able confuse it for a little while.

0x8525930: Radome stands for radar dome. It is a cover protecting a super-sensitive electronic scanning array.
0x85259a4: Almost all modern combat aircraft have them.
0x85259e4: It is not just a radar system in there. That radome probably contains infrared sensors, motion detectors, and other kind of quipment, too.
0x8525a80: It is like a combination of eyes, ears and nose all rolled into one. If you could destroy that you might have a chance...

0x857b884: Use your Stinger missiles carefully. If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.

0x858d898: Snake, it's just you and Liquid now. There's no advice I can give you.
0x858d8f0: Trust yourself! You have got to win!!

0x85a7868: Damn! A surveillance camera!

0x85b1060: I'll drive!

0x85b6864: Damn! No keys!

0x85be064: All right! Keys!!

0x85c5868: I got it, Snake! Jump in!!
0x85cd874: Fire that machine gun with your weapon button.
0x85cd8b4: Shoot'em, Snake!

0x85da068: Snake, hurry! Get in!

0x85e2064: What are you doing?

0x85e8060: Hurry!!

0x85ed860: Snake!!

0x85f3864: Snake, hold on!

0x85fa864: Uh oh, Snake. Check point!

0x8600060: We'll never make it!

0x8604864: Snake, clear a path!!

0x8609860: Shoot those drums!

0x860e064: Snake, strafe those guards!!

0x8614060: Snake, shoot'em!!

0x8618064: Okay, Snake. Let's go!
0x861d864: We're not out of the woods yet!

0x8622878: Snake, Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north. Hurry!

0x863110c: Snake, don't kill the dogs...Please?
0x8631144: What are you talking about. If I don't kill them, they'll kill me.
0x8631198: But those dogs are just innocent animals.
0x86311d4: If they were guilty, it'd be okay?
0x8631208: ...But you...you keep dogs, don't you?
0x8631240: So what?! This is war. My private hobbies have got nothing to do with it.
0x863129c: ..........

0x866f878: Snake, those dogs...
0x866f8a0: Gimme a break...

0x8679870: You should use your Night-Vision Goggles in dark places.

0x8683880: If you want Night-Vision Goggles, there's a pair in the lab at the Warhead Storage Building.

0x8694058: ..........
0x869e858: ..........
0x86a9078: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.

0x86b7064: ...I'll be watching, Snake...

0x86bc0ac: There's a cargo elevator in the northeast part of the bottom floor. You can take that to Metal Gear's underground base.
0x86bc134: You'll spot it right away, it's got a big patrol light attached to it.

0x86dd948: The elevator is stopped at a lower floor and it won't come up. Is there some way to get to an elevator that will take me down further?
0x86dd9e0: Well...there is one, but...
0x86dda0c: Where?
0x86dda24: Can you see to the west of the blast furnace?
0x86dda64: You see that crane? I think if you go down those steps, you'll get to the other side.
0x86ddacc: Did you ever see anyone actually go down there?
0x86ddb0c: No, but I've seen mice go there.
0x86ddb40: Do I look like a mouse to you?
0x86ddb70: Be careful of that crane, too.

0x873007c: If you stick close to those steps, I think you can make it to the other side...probably.

0x873f884: Are you in the boiler room? Those pipes are really old. Once in a while they blow out steam, so be careful.

0x8752868: You call this once in a while?

0x875a084: If you take that cargo elevator down, you'll wind up in Metal Gear's underground base.

0x876b898: It's automatically set to go back and forth between the blast furnace and the underground maintenance base.
0x876b914: It's not there yet, so you'll just have to wait.

0x8784894: Snake, the elevator won't move unless you push the switch. There's a control panel, right? Get closer and press the Action Button.

0x879e878: Snake, there's nowhere to hide in that elevator. You'll have to fight!

0x87ab880: That elevator is for transporting vehicles and building materials to the underground maintenance base.

0x87bc0bc: So that's why it's so big.
0x87bc0e8: The elevator you're on right now is the #1 elevator.
0x87bc130: That elevator won't take you down all the way, so you'll have to switch to the #2 elevator at the relay point.

0x87e08e4: Snake, that's the relay point between elevator #1 and elevator #2.
0x87e0938: Why was it set up this way?
0x87e0964: Well, for a long time it had been set up so that you could take one elevator all the way to the bottom,
0x87e09dc: but I heard that they changed it because of something to do with the structural integrity of the rock.

0x8813074: The No.2 elevator is next to you, right? Transfer to that one.

0x881f890: If you take that elevator down, you'll wind up in the warehouse. Metal Gear's underground maintenance base is just past there.

0x8836078: Crows...
0x8836094: What?
0x88360ac: There are a lot of crows here.

0x8843884: What the hell are all these crows doing around here.
0x88438cc: Crows? ...You got me.

0x88550b0: There were crows around from before.
0x88550e8: But for some reason they started to really increase in number around there about the same time that FOX-HOUND  came to the base.
0x885517f: s really weird. I wonder what it could mean...?

0x8878078: Ravens..
0x8878094: What?
0x88780ac: There are a lot of ravens here.

0x8885884: What the hell are all these ravens doing around here?
0x88858cc: Ravens...? You got me.

0x88978bc: There were ravens around from before.
0x88978f4: But for some reason they started to really increase in number around there about the same time that FOX-HOUND  came to the base.
0x889798b: s really weird. I wonder what it could mean...?

0x88bb0a4: That room is still under construction because their main priority was to finish Metal Gear's underground base.
0x88bb124: But the good thing is, with all those containers, it should be easy to hide, right?

0x88db074: I don't know anything about Dr. Naomi, so there's not much I can say...

0x88e7084: But, Snake, I think you'd better leave that to Colonel Campbell. Don't you think you'd better just get to the Control Room.

0x88fa0a8: That's where the emergency PAL code override system is.
0x88fa0f0: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the base you're in.
0x88fa13c: Do you see that ladder next to Metal Gear?
0x88fa178: You can climb up there.

0x891b07c: Otacon. How's it going?
0x891b0a4: Not yet. Give me a little more time.

0x8929878: Got it yet?
0x8929894: Please, Snake, give me a little more time.

0x893608c: How about it? Did you find the override system file?
0x89360d4: Not yet. I need a little more time.

0x8949428: Well, I found lots of information about that new nuclear weapon...
0x894947c: There are 4 stages involved in launching a ballistic missile. The first one is the Boost Stage.
0x89494ec: It starts at the point the missile is launched and ends after all the rocket fuel is burned and the missile is propelled into the exosphere.
0x894958c: The next stage is the Post-Boost Stage. It starts after all the fuel is burned and ends after the re-entry vehicle is ejected.
0x894961c: Next is the Intermediate Course Stage. It takes place after the re-entry vehicle is ejected and lasts until the missile enters the exosphere.
0x89496bc: Then comes the Final Stage. It starts when the re-entry vehicle enters the exosphere and it lasts until it reaches its ultimate target on the ground.
0x8949764: Missile defense systems use military satellites to detect rocket emissions during the initial Boost Stage of a missile.
0x89497ec: But this new nuclear weapon employs the rail gun's ability to fire projectiles at ultra-high velocities, instead of using a rocket.
0x8949880: That's why it can't be detected by today's missile defense systems!
0x89498d4: And on top of that, the re-entry vehicle also uses Stealth technology...
0x8949930: It's so accurate that its fifty percent zone comes close to 50 meters. That's as good as the best ICBM.
0x89499a8: A highly accurate, undetectable, uninterceptable nuclear weapon. We wouldn't even be able to tell where it came from...
0x8949a30: And that's not all. A standard ballistic missile uses a 2-stage or a 3-stage solid fuel rocket for its propulsion system.
0x8949abc: Besides costing lots of money, safely maintaining the solid rocket fuel and readying the missile for launch requires a lot of work.
0x8949b50: But a railgun-launched nuclear warhead avoids all of those problems. And it's cheap too.
0x8949bbc: It's the perfect nuke. A general's dream...
0x8949bf8: And the world's nightmare.

0x8aa4080: Did you find the file for the override system?
0x8aa40c0: Just wait a little longer.

0x8ab2300: I found out a lot about the arms industry though...
0x8ab2344: After the Cold War ended, the United States slashed its defense budget by more than 15%. Naturally, the arms industry was severely affected.
0x8ab23e4: It resulted in an orgy of mergers and acquisitions.
0x8ab2428: Some of the big arms conglomerates today are made up of what 10 years ago would have been 20 or more smaller arms companies.
0x8ab24b8: ArmsTech is one of those. But we lost our bid to produce the US Air Force's next line of fighter jets.
0x8ab2530: Then we took a stab at civilian applications, but that was a failure too. The company was about to go belly up.
0x8ab25b0: Ironically, the Defense Department was in pretty much the same situation.
0x8ab260c: Thanks to big budget cuts, they were forced to turn to the private sector to help fund their weapons development.
0x8ab2690: On top of that, the government began to actively export their advanced weapons technology to the private sector...
0x8ab2714: ...in order to maintain a high standard of quality in the country's defense armaments.
0x8ab277c: Eventually they decided on a joint development project for new weapon systems between the DOD and the private sector.
0x8ab2804: And...since both sides were in such bad financial shape, that's where all the backscratching came in.
0x8ab287c: So there was another reason for the joint development of Metal Gear, huh. It wasn't just President Baker trying to keep ArmsTech afloat...

0x8ba20b4: The terrorists are finished inputting the detonation codes!
0x8ba2100: The only way to stop the launch now is to re-input the detonation codes to lock the detonation mechanism. You need that card key to do it.

0x8bc6070: Find that card key, Snake! There's no other way!

0x8bcf8d8: That key is actually an IC card. Its connector pins and main body are made of a shape memory alloy.
0x8bcf94c: It's designed so that unless it has been changed to the correct shape,
0x8bcf9a4: it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the Control Room and the detonation code won't be entered.

0x8c0488c: You found the card key, right? First comes the room temperature key. Put it into the far left terminal in the Control Room.

0x8c1b87c: Snake, the card key changed shape. You've got to change it back to room temperature!

0x8c2c0a0: Next you've got to cool the card key.
0x8c2c0d8: Where should I do that?
0x8c2c100: This is Alaska. Go outside, it's cold everywhere.

0x8c440a0: Next you've got to cool the key. Look, you're close to the warehouse where you fought Raven, right.
0x8c44114: That place is right in the middle of the permafrost layer and there's no heater either.

0x8c63094: But you're close to the warehouse where you fought Raven, right.
0x8c630e8: That place is right in the middle of the permafrost layer and there's no heater either.

0x8c7c0ac: Snake, it looks like you changed the card key's shape correctly.
0x8c7c100: Go and put it into the middle terminal in the Control Room. Before it warms up and changes back to its original shape.

0x8c9e87c: Snake, look at the card key. It changed back! You have to change it again!

0x8cae8d0: Naomi's an enemy spy?! ...I can't believe it!
0x8cae910: I don't want to believe it either, but...
0x8cae94c: Snake, leave it to Colonel Campbell. You've got to concentrate on re-inputting that detonation code.
0x8cae9c4: You're right...

0x8cdb8b0: Somewhere warm? What about the blast furnace?
0x8cdb8f0: But the problem is if you go through a cold place on the way back, the card key might change shape. You need to hurry on the way back.

0x8cff8c0: It looks like you changed the shape correctly. The last card key goes in the far right terminal in the Control Room.
0x8cff948: But be careful. If you're in a cold place for too long, it'll change back to its original shape. You need to hurry.

0x8d2a210: I can't really blame Dr. Naomi...I feel sorry for her.
0x8d2a258: ...Ever since I was a little kid, I always hated my first name.
0x8d2a2a8: Hal, isn't it?
0x8d2a2c8: Yeah...I'm not a computer, I'm a human...
0x8d2a304: ...My grandfather taking part in the Manhattan Project...my father being born on the day of the Hiroshima bomb...I hated every part of that.
0x8d2a3a4: My name, my father, my grandfather. ...It felt like all those things were a ball and chain around my legs, dragging me down..
0x8d2a434: But now that I think about it, I realize that I was blessed.
0x8d2a484: At least I know who I am...where I came from...
0x8d2a4c4: But Dr. Naomi didn't even know who her parents were, what her real name was. She must have been a very lonely little girl...
0x8d2a554: Otacon...
0x8d2a570: ...Sorry, Snake. I guess right now you should focus on re-inputting those PAL codes.

0x8dcf078: You still haven't input the final card key. Hurry to the Control Room.

0x8ddd884: That's not the right shape. Hurry and warm it up. The blast furnace is probably the best place.

0x8df087c: What are you doing? The door is open, Snake. Hurry up and go after Liquid!

0x8e01378: Snake, Rex's armor is impregnable. You can't do any damage with the weapons you've got.
0x8e013e0: Rex uses the latest advances in compound armor.
0x8e01420: The only way you can pierce it is with a high performance HEAT (high explosive, anti-tank) round.
0x8e01494: So what do I do?
0x8e014b8: Rex's pilot seat operates exactly like a VR system.
0x8e014fc: It's got multiple sensors connected to a high tech interface used for the controls.
0x8e01560: It's completely self-enclosed and shut off from the outside environment.
0x8e015bc: He's not using his naked eyes?
0x8e015ec: That's right. So if you could somehow destroy the sensors...
0x8e0163c: Do you see that round plate on Rex's left arm?
0x8e0167c: Yeah, that thing that looks like a shield?
0x8e016b8: That's a radome. If you can destroy that thing, it won't be able to use its electronic equipment.
0x8e0172c: So he'll be blinded?
0x8e01754: Yeah. Try to hit that radome with a Stinger missile.
0x8e0179c: So that will stop it?
0x8e017c4: No, Rex was designed so it can be controlled manually too.
0x8e01810: Oh great.
0x8e0182c: The part that looks like a beak is where the pilot seat is. In an emergency it will open up.
0x8e0189c: Rex's armor is perfect. You can't destroy it.
0x8e018dc: You told me that already.
0x8e01908: But the interior is a different story.
0x8e01940: I get it...first I destroy the radome. That will force him to open up the pilot's seat.
0x8e019a8: Right. If you can shoot a Stinger missile into the cockpit, you'll destroy the computer control system.
0x8e01a20: You intentionally designed it with a weak point?
0x8e01a64: It's not a weak point. I like to think of it as a character flaw. People just aren't complete without some type of character flaw, don't you think?
0x8e01b08: I guess so. I owe you one, Otacon.

0x8f10880: First use a Stinger missile to destroy the radome and disable its electronics.

0x8f20900: I saw it in President Baker's top secret files. Rex has a free electron laser mounted on its belly.
0x8f20974: It's a laser weapon that discharges a laser beam into an electron beam that's been accelerated using giant magnets.
0x8f209f8: It can generate an incredible amount of energy...pretty close to 100 megawatts. That's ten times greater than any other laser out there.

0x8f63118: Rex is equipped with anti-tank missiles on both of his knees. They're a laser semi-active homing type that doesn't use wires.
0x8f631a8: The shooter uses a laser illuminator to bounce a laser beam off the target.
0x8f63204: After that, the missile uses the light reflected off the target to home in on it.
0x8f63268: Fortunately, the missiles are tipped with HEAT rounds and not anti- personnel  warheads. But if they hit you directly, you'll be sorry. Be careful.

0x8fae87c: If Rex steps on you, it'll be all over. Be very careful when he gets close.

0x8fbd908: The rail gun uses magnetism to fire projectiles.
0x8fbd94c: By perfecting the process of shell acceleration, the railgun is able to fire a projectile with a muzzle velocity of over 100 kilometers per second.
0x8fbd9f0: It was originally going to be used, as part of SDI, to shoot down enemy ICBMs outside the atmosphere.
0x8fbda68: It's ironic that now it's going to be used to deliver a nuclear warhead...

0x90030f4: Rex is the first actual prototype model, but they've been doing virtual prototyping for a while now.
0x900316c: They pop it into a VR simulation while it's still in the design phase.
0x90031c4: That way they can make improvements to the design while testing it under all sorts of simulated conditions.
0x9003240: So even though it's a prototype, it's extremely well-designed. Be careful!

0x9042878: Snake, I don't know anything about fighting. But, you've got to beat Liquid!

0x9051888: If you look like you're about to fall off the back of Rex, press any button rapidly. You'll be able to climb up more quickly.

0x9065868: Uh oh. A surveillance camera.

0x9075064: Darn! No keys!

0x907c868: I got'em! Let's go!

0x9084054: I got it! Snake, Jump in!
0x908e07c: Use the weapon button to fire that machine gun.
0x908e0c0: Shoot back with it, Snake!

0x909d868: Snake, hurry! Get in!

0x90a5064: What are you doing!?

0x90ab854: Hurry!!

0x90b1860: Snake!!

0x90b7868: Snake, hold on!!

0x90c0868: Uh oh, Snake. It's a check point.

0x90c8064: Damn! We can't get through!

0x90ce868: Snake. You gotta clear a path!

0x90d6864: Shoot those drums, Snake!

0x90dc068: Snake! Do something about them!!

0x90e3064: We've got to break through!

0x90e8868: Good job, Snake!
0x90e888c: Let's go!!

0x90ef864: It's another check point, Snake.

0x9144078: What's wrong, Snake?

0x9153070: You're a mess, Snake!

0x915f86c: What's the matter?
0x915f890: Scared?
0x916086c: Too scared to show your face?
0x9161864: Come out and fight!!
0x916286c: Snake, come out and fight.

0x916d070: So Snake!
0x916d08c: You learned fear!!
0x916e060: Die!!
0x916f064: Eat this!!

0x91ae864: You flea!!

0x91d6068: Damn! I lost him!!

0x91de064: Where'd you go!?

0x91e5060: There you are!!

0x91eb868: I got you, Snake!

0x91f3878: You think you can beat me with that little thing?

0x9201868: You've got no chance, Snake!

0x920a880: You're out of missiles, Snake!!
0x920a8b0: Playtime's over!!!

0x921c89c: Snake!
0x921c8b4: You're out of missiles and now you're out of luck!!!
0x921c8fc: Now pay the ultimate price for your weakness!!!

0x923a068: What's wrong, little brother!?

0x924086c: You don't want to save the girl!?

0x9248060: You're nothing!
0x924c86c: How could you be Big Boss' son!?
0x925506c: Come here, Snake!
0x9255090: Be a man!
0x925e86c: I'm here!
0x925e888: Come and get me!!
0x9267864: That was nothing!
0x926c860: Is that all you've got!?
0x927106c: You think you can beat me with that?

0x928086c: Nice going, Snake.

0x928b060: Hurry! Climb up!

0x928e6e8:  !!
0x9290074: What's wrong?
0x9290094: Is that all you've got...brother?

0x929b868: So that's the best you can do, eh!!

0x92a305c: Get up!
0x92ba86c: What's wrong, Snake!

0x92c40a0: If you leave a lot of footprints, you can confuse your enemy. But don't let your footprints reveal the direction you went in.
0x92c4130: Disguise your footprints to fool the enemy.

0x92e1878: Those mice are Alaskan field mice. Don't worry. They can't hurt you.

0x92f0140: Wild field mice don't have a thick layer of fat, but they can still survive the bitter winters here without hibernating.
0x92f01cc: They dig tunnels under the snow and that's where they stay warm.
0x92f0220: Survival specialists, huh. I should learn from them.
0x92f0268: But there's a dark side too. Sometimes the males will kill and eat offspring that's not their own.
0x92f02dc: To ensure the survival of their own genes, right?
0x92f0320: Yeah. Pretty brilliant program, huh.

0x9341884: If there are mice, that means there must be an exit somewhere. Follow the mice.

0x9353878: Snake, that floor is designed so that your footsteps echo.

0x9361164: Listen, Snake. There's a way to walk so that your footsteps won't be heard. I call it stalking'. Here's how you do it.
0x93611ec: First, put your weight on the opposite foot that you're going to step with. Then take a step so that your heel makes contact with the ground first.
0x9361290: Then as you slowly lower the tip of your foot to the floor, gradually shift your weight onto that foot.
0x9361308: Use your knees to maintain the subtle balance.  Try it.
0x9361350: I...I can't do it...
0x9361378: Another way is to wear your socks over your shoes...

0x93c3074: If you crawl on your stomach, you won't make any noise either...

0x93ce900: A cardboard box, huh. Just like Zanzibar.
0x93ce93c: It saved my skin more than a few times in Outer Heaven too.
0x93ce988: Getting the maximum use out of ordinary on hand objects is the first principle of survival. It's especially important for covert operations.
0x93cea28: I haven't forgotten what you taught me.

0x940a888: Snake, that's probably some type of nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a gas mask.

0x941f09c: Those are wolf dogs in there. Just like their name, they're a cross between huskies and Alaskan wolves. They were bred to be used as sled dogs.

0x943b9b4: They were trying to create an animal that would combine the gentleness of a dog with the endurance and ferocity of a wolf.
0x943ba40: But they didn't get the stamina and power they were hoping for.
0x943ba90: On top of that, their personalities wound up closer to wolves. Most of them won't even let you get close. That's why they never caught on.
0x943bb2c: Oh that's right. You're a musher.
0x943bb60: Yeah. And after they outlawed the use of hybrids in dog sled races in 2002, no one even wanted to breed them anymore.
0x943bbe8: I heard that most of them were put to sleep after that...
0x943bc34: Yes, but some of the wolf dog pups that were thrown away went wild. I've heard that wild wolf dogs hunt in packs just like wolves.
0x943bcc8: Better be careful.

0x94b9880: The wolf dogs aren't attacking? Are you carrying something that might be causing them to act like that?

0x94cb0a8: Your C-rations are frozen? Never eat frozen C-rats. It'll cause a temperature imbalance that'll drain your strength.
0x94cb130: Make sure you warm those C's before you eat em.

0x94ec170: Master, you and I...we're nothing more than dogs, are we?
0x94ec1bc: That's not like you, Snake...Don't let what Sniper Wolf say bother you.
0x94ec214: ..........
0x94ec230: Listen. There's not a soldier alive that doesn't question himself. And if there is one, he's nothing more than a murderer.
0x94ec2bc: But someone like Wolf...a soldier who's looking for nothing more than their own death is no good to anyone either.
0x94ec340: Once she started to look for death, it was all over.
0x94ec388: That's how you'll end up too, Snake...

0x95588c0: Naturally, in an enclosed room, your motion is limited. But that doesn't mean that you should stand still and become a human target.
0x9558958: You can win if you watch how your enemy moves and then cleverly counter it.

0x9583068: There are a lot of crows around here...

0x958a0f8: Some say that ravens have the power to predict death. The great poet Marlowe wrote about them in the 16th century.
0x958a17d: "Thus like the sad presaging raven that tolls. The sick man's passport in her hollow beak,
0x958a1e8: And in the shadow of the silent night. Doth shake contagion from her sable wings."

0x95ce868: That's pretty gloomy, Master.

0x95d5068: By the way...
0x95d5088: What?
0x95db0a8: Ravens will eat vegetables, meat, garbage...pretty much anything.
0x95db0fc: It seems dirty to us, but that's what allows them to live even in a climate like this.

0x95fc8e0: Legends say that crows have three times the life span of a man, and that ravens have three times the life span of a crow.
0x95fc96c: That's just an old wives' tale, but it's true that crows live longer than many types of birds. Northern Ravens can live pretty close to 70 years.

0x9634898: Those aren't crows, they're Northern Ravens. The Inuit and other native Americans worshipped Northern Ravens as creator deities.

0x964e0b8: I want to ask you about Naomi.
0x964e0e8: I'm looking into the details now, but it doesn't look good. Weren't you ever suspicious about her, Snake?
0x964e164: ..........
0x964e180: ...Snake, keep your guard up.

0x96750ac: That place is right in the middle of the permafrost. Just like the name says, it never melts. I've heard over 85% of Alaska is permafrost.

0x9697080: One way to prevent your C-rations from freezing is to hold them close to your body by equipping them.
.
0x96a8880: It's extremely cold there, Snake. If you don't hurry, your C-rations will freeze.

0x96b8894: They're already frozen.
0x96b88bc: You can warn them up by equipping them. After a while, they should be okay to eat.

0x96cd900: An Native Alaskan American, huh? Probably Athapaskan. They're originally from the same tribe as the Apaches and Navajos of New Mexico.
0x96cd998: Anthropologically, they're related to the Japanese. There are even linguistic similarities between
0x96cda0c: Athapaskan languages and ancient Japanese. You and he probably share many of the same ancestors.

0x9713878: ...Master, I don't remember telling you that I was part Japanese...
0x97138cc: ..........

0x97238ac: The Four Man carry is a race where you have to run with four grown men hanging from a long stick that you carry on your back.
0x972393c: Apparently Raven does it with six men.

0x97460ac: Snake, I'm sure that woman calling herself Naomi is some type of spy.
0x9746104: And now I'm starting to think that Campbell might be hiding something too. Don't trust him.

0x976a084: Snake, isn't the detonation code input system in the Control Room? Hurry up and get in there!

0x977c07c: You lost the key? Hurry up and find it! They've already entered the detonation code!

0x978b09c: If you use the Mine Detector, you should be able to find the key even if it fell into the drainage ditch. Whatever you do, find that key!

0x97a6888: The only way to stop that launch is to lock the system by re-inputting the detonation codes.

0x97b9150: Snake, did you find the key?
0x97b9180: No, it's not here.
0x97b91a4: Don't be ridiculous. You saw it fall into the drainage ditch, didn't you?
0x97b9200: The drainage ditch...Isn't there something odd about it?
0x97b924c: No. There are a lot of big rats though...
0x97b9288: That's it, Snake! A rat must have eaten it!
0x97b92c4: Now, who's being ridiculous!
0x97b92f4: No, I'm right. There's no other possibility. Rats eat all sorts of things. There's nothing unusual about that.

0x980d880: Snake, a rat ate that key. You'll have to get it back. Follow the rat's route!

0x9820078: You got the card key back? Good job. Now hurry to the Control Room.

0x982f86c: Now freeze that key. Get somewhere cold!
0x9839074: The key changed shape. Hurry to the Control Room and input it.
0x98441f7: ?^!
0x9846074: Now you've gotta warm it. You need to find someplace hot.
0x98465c6: Q.?
0x984719c: fT,
0x98530f0: So Naomi is a spy, just like I thought. Campbell is hiding something too...
0x985314c: But that's okay. Fox Die is a virus... a biological weapon. There must be a vaccine.
0x98531b4: We can worry about getting that later, Snake, but right now you've got to focus on re-inputting those detonation codes. Okay?

0x9890878: The key changed shape. Hurry to the Control Room! That's the last key!

0x989f86c: Master, I've never heard you so excited.

0x98a8078: You got the card key back? Good job. Hurry and input it.

0x98b7904: So Naomi used Fox Die to take her revenge on you...
0x98b7948: Yeah, but she said she wasn't the one who made the decision to use it. According to her, it was just one part of this operation.
0x98b79dc: Hmmm. If this goes all the way up to Campbell, it might not be so easy to get that vaccine...oh well, forget about it...

0x98f8074: Hurry up and get to the Control Room. Input that last key!

0x9904870: First you have to change the shape of the last key.

0x990e888: Sound travels better in cold environments. If you're going to use a handgun, you should equip a suppressor.

0x99240d0: When the temperature falls down to minus 30 or minus 40 degrees celsius, you start to get ice fogs. That's when the moisture in the air freezes.
0x9924174: It may look pretty at first, but it'll severely limit your visibility. Be careful.

0x99540e8: Kipling, an English poet who also won the Nobel prize, said that once you go beyond 65 north,
0x9954158: you're beyond the reach of divine protection and human law.
0x99541a4: To survive in such surroundings, you have to be strong enough to not rely on God nor anyone else.

0x998c88c: In cold like this, over 70% of your body warmth is lost through your head. Put on some kind of hat.

0x99a20c4: In an arctic environment, it's important to change your underwear if you're sweating a lot. Dawdle around too much and you'll not only waste your
0x99a2168: strength, but you could even catch pneumonia. Gaming after a bath should be avoided.

0x99cd0d4: It's easy to dehydrate in sub-zero climates, so make sure to replenish your fluids. But don't ever try to do it by eating snow.
0x99cd164: You'll freeze your stomach and your body temperature will drop. Always melt the snow and then boil it before you drink it.

0x99fd0a4: No cold foods or cold liquids for you. That stuff causes a temperature imbalance that actually drains your body of energy.
0x99fd130: A golden rule in arctic environments.

0x9a1c088: I hate hats. Is a bandanna okay?
0x9a1c0bc: Well, I guess it's better than nothing...

0x9a2d8b8: Don't suddenly look into the dark. Look slowly from a light area to a darker area.
0x9a2d91c: If you do that, your eyes will gradually adjust and you'll be able to see better in the dark. Try not to play in the dark either.

0x9a550c0: When you're fighting in the dark, you need to use your sense of hearing and smell. Don't trust your eyes, use your ears.
0x9a5514c: Feel the flow of the air with your whole body. That's the way to tell where your enemy is.

0x9a7f874: People sometimes panic in the dark. Try to stay cool.

0x9a8d0c4: When you're wearing Night-Vision Goggles, the light gets amplified a hundred-fold.
0x9a8d128: So if you look at an explosion or a Stun Grenade, you may burn your retinas. If that happens, it'll take a little while until your vision returns.

0x9ab80bc: Snake, you've got to think. Your mind is your most dangerous weapon. If things are getting too complicated, try to simplify your thoughts.
0x9ab8158: You can also try calling Campbell for advice.

0x9adf8dc: Soldiers that have been forged in the fires of battle are used to catching naps whenever and wherever they can.
0x9adf95c: There's a big difference between real soldiers and those kids who have only been trained in VR simulators.
0x9adf9d8: After playing for a long time, you should get some rest too.

0x9b16098: People's reaction speed is slowest around three o'clock in the morning, and so is their judgment.
0x9b1610c: If you're feeling drowsy, you should get some sleep.

0x9b318bc: It's also important to be able to control your bodily functions.
0x9b31910: You never know when a long demo is about to begin, so make sure you're prepared to sit in front of the monitor for a long time if necessary.

0x9b590a0: It's never a good idea to fight on too full a stomach. It'll make you logy...maybe even sleepy.
0x9b59110: You should wait 30 minutes after eating before you play.

0x9b78080: Where I come from, a soldier who loses his head in combat is called a "target".

0x9b898a0: Military C-rations place an emphasis on calories.
0x9b898e4: That's why it's best to use them along with some other type of nutritional supplement such as vitamins or minerals.

0x9ba78a4: People who have been through war and survived develop a kind of sixth sense to warn them of danger. Trust your instincts as a soldier, as a gamer.

0x9bc70b0: In war, a split second can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Don't ever hesitate.
0x9bc7120: The slower you react, the greater the chance that you'll be beaten.

0x9bec0b4: That inner voice that warns you when danger is nearby...you can't learn that in training.
0x9bec120: You've got to have survived a few firefights...seen a few friends blown away before you learn that trick.

0x9c130bc: When you're trying to hide, avoid places that look like the enemy might search.
0x9c1311c: Think about how your enemy is going to move and then sneak in there. It doesn't matter how smart you are, just use your head out there.
.
0x9c3b880: Snake, divide and conquer. Try to take your enemies on one at a time.

0x9c4d088: You need to make snap decisions. In war, the difference between living and dying is counted in milliseconds.

0x9c6109c: The basic law of CQB (Close Quarters Battle) is to take your enemy out as quickly and efficiently as possible
0x9c6111c: while maintaining your own escape route.

0x9c7c0a4: Don't use your gun unless you need to. If you can get out of a jam using just your hands and feet, then do it. If you can't, then go for the gun.

0x9c9c0a4: Soldiers who lose their heads on the battlefield usually lose their heads on the battlefield. Get my meaning? Always have your next action planned.

0x9cbc098: Think carefully about your hiding spots. You may find a place where you can hide perfectly, but if you can't get your mission done, it's meaningless.

0x9cd70b0: Always use the most appropriate weapon for the situation.
0x9cd70fc: If you use a weapon that's not really doing the job, not only are you wasting ammo, but you're also putting your life in danger.

0x9cfa888: One way of letting yourself know when to change a magazine is to make the last few rounds of the mag tracers.

0x9d0e0b0: Plan your strategy based on the enemies' positions. Try to think like the enemy commander would think.
0x9d0e128: If you can put yourself in the map designer's mind, a lot of doors will open for you.

0x9d33090: Once you give up hope, it's all over. That's when you can't do anything right. Despair leads to death, you know.

0x9d4d880: You've got to believe. If you believe with your whole heart, you will succeed.

0x9d608bc: Sometimes in combat or when you're near the end of your rope, you can see things that normally aren't there or shouldn't be there.
0x9d60950: Relax. It's not a bug. It's just the mysteries of the human mind.

0x9d8c89c: Think about something terrible that happened in your life. Everyone has had something bad happen to them.
0x9d8c918: It'll help take your mind off the misery of the battlefield.

0x9da98ac: A real master of warfare alters his strategy to cope with changes in the battlefield conditions.
0x9da9920: If you always follow the book, you'll be transparent to your enemy.

0x9dcb0a0: War brings out the cruelty of man. No matter how the soldier was brought up, they all turn into animals when they're thrust into the heat of combat.

0x9de98a0: Sometimes, even though you know it's a losing battle, you just have to fight or be damned. A narrow chance is still a chance.

0x9e098b8: Foresight is important in war. In times of extreme danger, people's latent sixth sense often awakens.
0x9e09930: When that happens, throw logic to the wind and trust your instincts.

0x9e3188c: The only way to conquer fear is to stare it straight in the face and laugh at it. Never let fear control you.

0x9e49890: Don't feel guilty about the soldiers that died from your bullets. They knew the risks they were taking, just like you.

0x9e6209c: The weather in Alaska is very hard to predict. It can change on a dime. A lot of people say it's the worst weather in the world.

0x9e7f8c0: The most important tools you need to be a good sniper are the senses that you were born with. No amount of training can change those.
0x9e7f958: If your senses are dull from the beginning, you'll never be a great sniper.

0x9eaa0cc: According to the SWAT manual, the longest a shooter can stay adequately focused on his target is 15 minutes.
0x9eaa14c: After 15 minutes, the observer and the shooter change places. Sniping is usually a two man job.

0x9ed8084: It looks like your target is stationary. If you've had enough practice, it shouldn't be a difficult shot.

0x9eeb8b0: The scope of a sniper rifle is extremely powerful. On the other hand, it's got a very narrow field of vision.
0x9eeb930: If you're searching for your enemy's position, it'd be better to use your binoculars.

0xa1b0064: The key is wrong?

0xa1b7064: The wrong key...?

0xa1bd864: Was that the wrong one...?

0xa1c3864: Looks like the key doesn't fit..

0xa1cb064: A surveillance camera...

0xa1d0864: A surveillance camera?

0xa21905c: Huh?
0xa21d05c: Huh?
0xa22105c: Huh?
0xb42c85c: Huh?

Radio ---------------------

0x3e: Be careful, Snake. That air lock is set with infrared sensors.
0xa9: You probably can't see them with your naked eyes, but there are infrared beams coming out of that wall.
0x121: Touch any one of them, and the doors will seal off and the place will be flooded with poison gas.
0x193: Somehow you've got to get through without setting off those sensors.
0x237: I think you might be able to fool the tank's electronic systems with a Chaff Grenade.
0x353: You're incredible, Snake! You singlehandedly beat an M1 tank.
0x39e: No big deal. But I'll bet that VR simulator you trained on didn't have any scenarios that put you one on one against a tank, did it?
0x436: No. But there was no scenario where I had to work alone with a special forces soldier against a group of terrorists either.
0x4c5: In real life, things never go the way you expect them to...especially on a battlefield.
0x52d: I'm already holed up in the Warhead Storage Building. It looks like Dr. Emmerich is still fine, but I'm not sure for how much longer...
0x5d4: Hurry up this way, okay?
0x659: Deepthroat? No, I don't know anyone who calls himself that.
0x6a2: I see...
0x6b5: I wonder why he's trying to help you.
0x6e5: I have no idea.
0x6ff: A trap?
0x711: Could be. But for the time being, I'll have to trust him...
0x783: Where are the remote controlled missiles?
0x7ed: I think the remote controlled missiles are on the 1st floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0x884: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held in his lab in the northeast part of that floor.
0x8e8: They've flooded the area with gas to prevent him from escaping.
0x954: But there should be a gas mask on that floor too. If you use it, you'll be able to make it through easily.
0x9fb: Snake, Dr. Emmerich is being held just north of there.
0xa91: Dr. Emmerich should be in the laboratory area in the 2nd floor basement.
0xafc: He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north.
0xbab: Meryl, what are these holes in the walls for?
0xbe6: That's an air cleaner for blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.
0xc80: That's an air cleaner for blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.
0xd28: Who are you?
0xd3f: I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there.
0xd92: The one from the prison...?
0xdb8: You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?
0xdef: ......No...it's not him...
0xe14: Just exactly who are you?
0xe38: I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess.
0xe98: You came by yourself?
0xeb8: You think you're some kind of one-man army?
0xf10: You're not even armed.
0xf31: I appreciate your help from before. But...
0xf77: I don't need lectures.
0xf98: You're just like your uncle, you know.
0xfc9: How do you know my uncle?
0xfed: We go way back.
0x1007: What's your name?
0x1023: My name's not important.
0x1046: Aha!
0x1055: Could you be Snake?
0x1073: Are you Solid Snake?
0x1092: That's what some people called me.
0x10bf: The legendary Solid Snake...! You!?
0x10f7: Sorry about before...
0x1117: I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys.
0x1154: But I knew you were.
0x1173: How?
0x118e: It's your eyes.
0x11a8: My eyes?
0x11bb: They're not soldier's eyes.
0x11e1: They're rookie's eyes, right?
0x1209: No, they're beautiful, compassionate eyes.
0x124d: Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.
0x128f: You trying to sweep me off my feet?
0x12c7: Don't worry. You'll land back on them once you meet me.
0x130c: The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid.
0x134d: I don't believe that.
0x1377: Why did you look so surprised when you saw my face?
0x13b8: Because you look just like him.
0x13e2: ...You mean the terrorists' leader, Liquid Snake?
0x1421: Yeah, you know him?
0x143f: You're not brothers, are you!?
0x1468: I have no family.
0x1484: So what's the deal then?
0x14a7: Who knows. Why don't you ask him?
0x14df: But first I want some information.
0x150c: You were involved in this exercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?
0x156f: I'm sorry. I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack.
0x15d6: That's okay.
0x15f7: But what is this place?
0x1619: I don't think it's just a nuclear weapons disposal facility...
0x1665: Boy oh boy...it's just like them!
0x1691: Nobody's told you anything, did they?
0x16c1: Okay...you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.
0x1715: This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech.
0x177a: This is a civilian base?
0x179d: Right. For the development of Metal Gear.
0x17d4: Colonel!
0x17e7: FOX-HOUND and the Next- Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead.
0x1870: Why FOX-HOUND?
0x1889: Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.
0x18e0: They figured they could help keep it all hush-hush.
0x1921: But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.
0x195e: Why just this time?
0x197c: I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program...that's what I heard anyway.
0x1a15: Hmmm...sounds kinda fishy...
0x1a3c: So what do you think the terrorists want?
0x1a73: Sorry, I'm not sure...
0x1a94: I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started...
0x1ae7: Oh yeah.
0x1afa: That's when he gave you detonation code override keys, right?
0x1b45: That's right.
0x1b5d: Amazing you were able to keep'em hidden from the guards.
0x1ba3: Well...women have more hiding places than men.
0x1bdf: Anyway, you met Baker, huh? How's he holding up?
0x1c1d: ...He's dead.
0x1c35: What!?
0x1c46: Heart attack.
0x1c5e: Same as the DARPA Chief...
0x1c8f: The Chief died from a heart attack too...?
0x1cc7: Yeah...Was either of them sick or anything?
0x1d00: No...not that I heard of.
0x1d24: Well I don't believe in coincidences.
0x1d54: Something funny's going on.
0x1d7a: Hmmm. Sounds like it.
0x1d9a: But I have no idea what.
0x1dbd: Me neither...yet.
0x1dd9: Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?
0x1e16: You mean Dr. Emmerich?
0x1e37: Yes. Is he still alive?
0x1e59: Probably. He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north.
0x1ee7: 2nd floor basement?
0x1f05: Yeah, that's where his lab is.
0x1f2e: I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program.
0x1f81: So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway...
0x1fc4: Then we'd better do something before he finishes.
0x2003: You're right.
0x201b: In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x2099: You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?
0x20d9: It won't be the first time...
0x2101: ..........
0x2116: What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?
0x2171: There's a cargo door on the 1st floor of this building that leads to the north.
0x21ce: What's the security level of the door there?
0x2208: Five, but it's okay...I've got a level five card.
0x2247: Well...
0x2259: I've got to go save the Doctor. You should go...
0x2297: I'm going with you!
0x22b5: No way.
0x22c7: You're still too green. I want you to hide somewhere.
0x230a: I'm not green.
0x2323: Oh yes you are.
0x233d: ..........
0x235c: You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over!
0x23b1: Good luck doesn't last forever!
0x23fb: I don't know what happened. I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.
0x2451: I never had any problems in training...
0x2483: But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated...
0x24ee: Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different.
0x2547: Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed about being a soldier...
0x259e: Everyday of my life, I've trained my mind and body for the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now...
0x262a: So what now? You wanna quit?
0x2651: I can't quit.
0x2673: I can't allow myself to quit now.
0x269f: Listen, Meryl. Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.
0x26f2: Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.
0x2755: In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions...worst traits come out.
0x27a5: It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield.
0x27f4: But this isn't a war.
0x2814: It's a terrorist action.
0x2837: You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.
0x2875: The adrenaline in your blood stream is starting to thin out.
0x28bf: Just take it easy.
0x28dc: But I learned all about combat high at the academy...
0x291f: We'll talk about it later.
0x2944: For now, just think about keeping yourself alive.
0x29a3: If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff.
0x29ef: Okay, let me try to say this another way...
0x2a28: Stay the hell out of my way.
0x2a4f: You're a real bastard...
0x2a72: ...just like my uncle said.
0x2aa2: Ha ha. I told you.
0x2abf: The real me is no match for the legend.
0x2af4: It looks like you were right.
0x2b9e: Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl.
0x2bd3: We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.
0x2c04: Then we'll take care of the detonation code override.
0x2c47: Got ya.
0x2c59: But listen, I know this area better than you.
0x2c94: Call me if you have any questions.
0x2cc1: Be careful, okay?
0x2cdd: After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.
0x2dbc: Who are you?
0x2dd3: I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there.
0x2e26: The one from the prison...?
0x2e4c: You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?
0x2e83: ......No...it's not him...
0x2ea8: Just exactly who are you?
0x2ecc: I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess.
0x2f2c: You came by yourself?
0x2f4c: You think you're some kind of one-man army?
0x2fa4: You're not even armed.
0x2fc5: I appreciate your help from before. But...
0x300b: I don't need lectures.
0x302c: You're just like your uncle, you know.
0x305d: How do you know my uncle?
0x3081: We go way back.
0x309b: What's your name?
0x30b7: My name's not important.
0x30da: Aha!
0x30e9: Could you be Snake?
0x3107: Are you Solid Snake?
0x3126: That's what some people called me.
0x3153: The legendary Solid Snake...! You!?
0x318b: Sorry about before...
0x31ab: I wasn't sure if you were one of the good guys.
0x31e8: But I knew you were.
0x3207: How?
0x3222: It's your eyes.
0x323c: My eyes?
0x324f: They're not soldier's eyes.
0x3275: They're rookie's eyes, right?
0x329d: No, they're beautiful, compassionate eyes.
0x32e1: Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.
0x3323: You trying to sweep me off my feet?
0x335b: Don't worry. You'll land back on them once you meet me.
0x33a0: The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid.
0x33e1: I don't believe that.
0x340b: Why did you look so surprised when you saw my face?
0x344c: Because you look just like him.
0x3476: ...You mean the terrorists' leader, Liquid Snake?
0x34b5: Yeah, you know him?
0x34d3: You're not brothers, are you!?
0x34fc: I have no family.
0x3518: So what's the deal then?
0x353b: Who knows. Why don't you ask him?
0x3573: But first I want some information.
0x35a0: You were involved in this exercise from the beginning. What exactly happened here?
0x3603: I'm sorry. I was captured along with President Baker right after the terrorist attack.
0x366a: That's okay.
0x368b: But what is this place?
0x36ad: I don't think it's just a nuclear weapons disposal facility...
0x36f9: Boy oh boy...it's just like them!
0x3725: Nobody's told you anything, did they?
0x3755: Okay...you see, this place isn't really for disposing nuclear weapons.
0x37a9: This base is owned and operated by a dummy corporation of ArmsTech.
0x380e: This is a civilian base?
0x3831: Right. For the development of Metal Gear.
0x3868: Colonel!
0x387b: FOX-HOUND and the Next- Generation Special Forces were called here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead.
0x3904: Why FOX-HOUND?
0x391d: Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret missions.
0x3974: They figured they could help keep it all hush-hush.
0x39b5: But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.
0x39f2: Why just this time?
0x3a10: I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal adoption of the Metal Gear program...that's what I heard anyway.
0x3aa9: Hmmm...sounds kinda fishy...
0x3ad0: So what do you think the terrorists want?
0x3b07: Sorry, I'm not sure...
0x3b28: I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started...
0x3b7b: Oh yeah.
0x3b8e: That's when he gave you detonation code override keys, right?
0x3bd9: That's right.

0x3d94: No...not that I heard of.
0x3db8: Well I don't believe in coincidences.
0x3de8: Something funny's going on.

0x4349: No way.
0x435b: You're still too green. I want you to hide somewhere.

0x4b53: The real me is no match for the legend.
0x4b88: It looks like you were right.
0x4c32: Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl.
0x4c67: We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.
0x4c98: Then we'll take care of the detonation code override.
0x4cdb: Got ya.
0x4ced: But listen, I know this area better than you.
0x4d28: Call me if you have any questions.
0x4d55: Be careful, okay?
0x4d71: After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.
0x4e31: Snake?.....Don't be so impatient. Settle down. I need a little more time to get the cargo door open.
0x4ec4: I'll call you when I get the door open. Just wait a little. Okay?
0x4f71: If you use a gas mask, you should be able to survive that gas for a long time.
0x4fec: Where is the gas mask?
0x500d: On the 2nd floor basement of that building. So you'll have to go through there without one.
0x50c1: A cardboard box? I heard stories from my uncle, but I always thought he was pulling my leg...I...I've got no comment.
0x51bb: The place is mined? Well, if you use  a Mine Detector, you'll be able to see the mines displayed on your radar.
0x526c: If you need a Mine Detector, there should be one on the 2nd floor of the tank hangar.
0x52fe: The cargo door's open already. If you exit there and go north, you'll get to the Warhead Storage Building where Dr. Emmerich is being held.
0x53bc: I'll head there now and wait for you. Hurry after me okay.
0x544b: Snake, did you lose your way? The cargo door is on the 1st floor.
0x54b9: Snake, where are you going? The Warhead Storage Building is north. I can't believe it... Solid Snake is lost.....
0x553e: I guess it's true, the reality really can't live up to the legend.
0x55ad: If you go north from there, you'll eventually come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0x5611: Dr. Emmerich should be in the laboratory area in the 2nd floor basement.
0x5689: I'll go ahead and wait for you there.
0x56b9: Meryl.
0x56ca: What? Are you going to tell me to stay back cause I'm too green again?
0x571e: Nope. It's your decision. I can't stop you from doing what you want, but...
0x5777: But?
0x5786: Don't do anything stupid, okay?
0x57b0: Stupid? Boy...thanks for the great show of confidence...
0x57f6: Meryl....
0x580a: Anyway...I'll see you there.
0x5855: Snake, did you lose your way? The cargo door is on the 1st floor.
0x58da: I think you might be able to fool the tank's electronic systems with a Chaff Grenade.
0x5953: No matter how good you are, there's no way you can match up against an M1 tank. All you can do is try to take out the person in the driver's seat.
0x59f9: With grenades, you should be able to attack the soldier on top of the tank too.
0x5acc: You're incredible, Snake! You singlehandedly beat an M1 tank.
0x5b17: No big deal. But I'll bet that VR simulator you trained on didn't have any scenarios that put you one on one against a tank, did it?
0x5baf: No. But there was no scenario where I had to work alone with a special forces soldier against a group of terrorists either.
0x5c3e: In real life, things never go the way you expect them to...especially on a battlefield.
0x5ca6: I'm already holed up in the Warhead Storage Building. It looks like Dr. Emmerich is still fine, but I'm not sure for how much longer...
0x5d4d: Hurry up this way, okay?
0x5dd2: Deepthroat? No, I don't know anyone who calls himself that.
0x5e1b: I see...
0x5e2e: I wonder why he's trying to help you.
0x5e5e: I have no idea.
0x5e78: A trap?
0x5e8a: Could be. But for the time being, I'll have to trust him...
0x5efc: Where are the remote controlled missiles?
0x5f66: I think the remote controlled missiles are on the 1st floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0x5ffd: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held in his lab in the northeast part of that floor.
0x6061: They've flooded the area with gas to prevent him from escaping.
0x60cd: But there should be a gas mask on that floor too. If you use it, you'll be able to make it through easily.
0x6174: Snake, Dr. Emmerich is being held just north of there.
0x620a: Dr. Emmerich should be in the laboratory area in the 2nd floor basement.
0x6275: He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north.
0x6325: Heavy arms fire in that area is strictly prohibited. An explosion could cause nuclear material to leak from one or more of the warheads...
0x63c3: ...and that would be a very serious problem. Please be careful.
0x642f: It looks like they're equipped with gas masks.
0x646b: That's because they are not supposed to use heavy arms.
0x64b0: Ah. You mean they use chemical weapons, instead.
0x652a: Hurry! Dr. Emmerich is in danger!
0x657e: Ninja?
0x658f: I've never heard of any member of FOX-HOUND like that....but you're going to have to do something about him if you want to save Dr. Emmerich.
0x67f1: Meryl, this pile of corpses...is this your handiwork?
0x6834: No way!
0x6865: I didn't think so.
0x6882: Who could have done that?
0x68a6: You got me.
0x68bc: But he must be somewhere up ahead.
0x68e9: Then I guess you'll just have to go and find out.
0x698d: Who are you?
0x69a4: I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there.
0x69f7: The one from the prison...?
0x6a1d: You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right?
0x6a54: ......No...it's not him...
0x6a79: Just exactly who are you?
0x6a9d: I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess.
0x6afd: You came by yourself?
0x6b1d: You think you're some kind of one-man army?

0x76d8: Sorry, I'm not sure...
0x76f9: I was captured with President Baker right after the revolt started...
0x774c: Oh yeah.
0x775f: That's when he gave you detonation code override keys, right?
0x77aa: That's right.
0x77c2: Amazing you were able to keep'em hidden from the guards.
0x7808: Well...women have more hiding places than men.
0x7844: Anyway, you met Baker, huh? How's he holding up?
0x7882: ...He's dead.
0x789a: What!?
0x78ab: Heart attack.
0x78c3: Same as the DARPA Chief...
0x78f4: The Chief died from a heart attack too...?
0x792c: Yeah...Was either of them sick or anything?
0x7965: No...not that I heard of.
0x7989: Well I don't believe in coincidences.
0x79b9: Something funny's going on.
0x79df: Hmmm. Sounds like it.
0x79ff: But I have no idea what.
0x7a22: Me neither...yet.
0x7a3e: Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear?
0x7a7b: You mean Dr. Emmerich?
0x7a9c: Yes. Is he still alive?
0x7abe: Probably. He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north.
0x7b4c: 2nd floor basement?
0x7b6a: Yeah, that's where his lab is.
0x7b93: I think they're forcing him to work on the nuclear launching program.
0x7be6: So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway...
0x7c29: Then we'd better do something before he finishes.
0x7c68: You're right.
0x7c80: In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x7cfe: You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake?
0x7d3e: It won't be the first time...
0x7d66: ..........
0x7d7b: What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held?
0x7dd6: There's a cargo door on the 1st floor of this building that leads to the north.
0x7e33: What's the security level of the door there?
0x7e6d: Five, but it's okay...I've got a level five card.
0x7eac: Well...
0x7ebe: I've got to go save the Doctor. You should go...
0x7efc: I'm going with you!
0x7f1a: No way.
0x7f2c: You're still too green. I want you to hide somewhere.
0x7f6f: I'm not green.
0x7f88: Oh yes you are.
0x7fa2: ..........
0x7fc1: You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over!
0x8016: Good luck doesn't last forever!
0x8060: I don't know what happened. I just couldn't pull the trigger right away.
0x80b6: I never had any problems in training...
0x80e8: But when I thought about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated...
0x8153: Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different.
0x81ac: Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed about being a soldier...
0x8203: Everyday of my life, I've trained my mind and body for the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now...
0x828f: So what now? You wanna quit?
0x82b6: I can't quit.
0x82d8: I can't allow myself to quit now.
0x8304: Listen, Meryl. Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone.
0x8357: Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it.
0x83ba: In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions...worst traits come out.
0x840a: It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield.
0x8459: But this isn't a war.
0x8479: It's a terrorist action.
0x849c: You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.
0x84da: The adrenaline in your blood stream is starting to thin out.
0x8524: Just take it easy.
0x8541: But I learned all about combat high at the academy...
0x8584: We'll talk about it later.
0x85a9: For now, just think about keeping yourself alive.
0x8608: If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff.
0x8654: Okay, let me try to say this another way...
0x868d: Stay the hell out of my way.
0x86b4: You're a real bastard...
0x86d7: ...just like my uncle said.
0x8707: Ha ha. I told you.
0x8724: The real me is no match for the legend.
0x8759: It looks like you were right.
0x8803: Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl.
0x8838: We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.
0x8869: Then we'll take care of the detonation code override.
0x88ac: Got ya.
0x88be: But listen, I know this area better than you.
0x88f9: Call me if you have any questions.
0x8926: Be careful, okay?
0x8942: After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.
0x8a07: If you use a gas mask, you should be able to survive that gas for a long time.
0x8a82: Where is the gas mask?
0x8aa3: On the 2nd floor basement of that building. So you'll have to go through there without one.
0x8b23: Snake, if you walk on that floor normally, it'll make a lot of noise and the enemy will hear you. Try crawling.
0x8c60: You're incredible, Snake! You singlehandedly beat an M1 tank.
0x8cab: No big deal. But I'll bet that VR simulator you trained on didn't have any scenarios that put you one on one against a tank, did it?
0x8d43: No. But there was no scenario where I had to work alone with a special forces soldier against a group of terrorists either.
0x8dd2: In real life, things never go the way you expect them to...especially on a battlefield.
0x8e3a: I'm already holed up in the Warhead Storage Building. It looks like Dr. Emmerich is still fine, but I'm not sure for how much longer...
0x8ee1: Hurry up this way, okay?
0x8f66: Deepthroat? No, I don't know anyone who calls himself that.
0x8faf: I see...
0x8fc2: I wonder why he's trying to help you.
0x8ff2: I have no idea.
0x900c: A trap?
0x901e: Could be. But for the time being, I'll have to trust him...
0x9090: Where are the remote controlled missiles?
0x90fa: I think the remote controlled missiles are on the 1st floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0x9191: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held in his lab in the northeast part of that floor.
0x91f5: They've flooded the area with gas to prevent him from escaping.
0x9261: But there should be a gas mask on that floor too. If you use it, you'll be able to make it through easily.
0x9308: Snake, Dr. Emmerich is being held just north of there.
0x939e: Dr. Emmerich should be in the laboratory area in the 2nd floor basement.
0x9409: He should be in the research lab in the 2nd floor basement of the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building to the north.
0x94b8: Meryl, what are these holes in the walls for?
0x94f3: That's an air cleaner for blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.
0x958d: That's an air cleaner for blowing tiny particles of dust off people's bodies before they enter the lab.
0x964b: Snake, are you okay?
0x967d: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x96b0: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x96ed: Snake...
0x9706: DO NOT SAVE

0x9cc0: This warining should not appear!!
0x9d30: Don't give up!
0x9d5c: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x9d95: Win Snake! Win!
0x9dc2: Don't die, Snake!
0x9df1: Do it for me! Snake!
0x9e33: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x9e87: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x9f01: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x9fbc: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0xa050: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0xa0eb: How can I help, Snake?
0xa11f: Snake, just tell me.  I'll do anything to help.
0xa16f: Snake, how are you holding up?
0xa1ab: Did you call, Snake?
0xa1d0: DO NOT SAVE

0xa78a: This warining should not appear!!
0xa7fa: Please Snake, don't give up.
0xa834: Come back alive, Snake...
0xa86b: Snake, it's all up to you...
0xa8b2: ! Snake!
0xa8e8: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0xa93c: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0xa9b6: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0xaa71: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0xab05: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0xaba7: Sorry. The Soliton radar won't work in a narrow space.
0xac0a: Too much harmonic resonance. The radio waves produce interference and we can't analyze the topographic data.
0xac87: Try to hang on until you get to a more open space. Okay?
0xacf3: DO NOT SAVE

0xb2ad: This warining should not appear!!
0xb2fe: Don't give up, Snake!
0xb33c: What can I do for you, Snake?
0xb377: What is it, Snake?
0xb3a7: You called, Snake?
0xb3d7: What's up, Snake?
0xb413: DO NOT SAVE

0xbd2a: This warining should not appear!!
0xbdab: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said "The graveyards are full of indispensable men."
0xbe11: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0xbe9b: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0xbeea: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0xbf51: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0xbffa: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0xc062: Well...I'll think about it.
0xc0c6: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0xc0f5: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Naomi said?
0xc155: "He that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death." Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0xc23b: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0xc2ae: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0xc303: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0xc394: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0xc409: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0xc46e: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0xc4f4: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0xc58b: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0xc638: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0xc689: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0xc70f: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0xc779: You're watching everything?
0xc79f: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0xc7f5: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0xc83c: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0xc897: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0xc8dc: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0xc99f: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0xc9fe: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0xca7a: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0xcb46: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0xcbde: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0xcc8d: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0xccd2: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0xcd93: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0xcded: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0xce3b: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0xce85: But you have no choice, Snake.
0xceae: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep  putting things in my pocket.
0xcf41: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0xcf81: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0xcfc2: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."
0xd017: What's that supposed to mean?
0xd03f: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0xd0b8: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0xd0fe: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0xd171: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0xd1c6: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0xd24c: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0xd2c1: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0xd326: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0xd3a1: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0xd438: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0xd4c7: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0xd526: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0xd5a2: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0xd663: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0xd6fb: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0xd79f: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0xd7e4: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0xd8bd: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy."
0xd91d: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0xd9b0: Snake,"This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise."
0xda09: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0xdac4: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0xdb03: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0xdb4a: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0xdb8d: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0xdbd1: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0xdc65: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0xdcc5: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0xdd39: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0xdd72: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0xddf3: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0xde58: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0xdebe: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0xdeef: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0xdf48: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0xdfa5: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0xe035: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0xe072: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0xe0ea: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0xe128: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0xe18e: You can say that again.
0xe1ce: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0xe200: Why do you ask?
0xe21a: I like to play fighting games.
0xe243: Games?
0xe254: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0xe2fd: Not a very good job, huh.
0xe321: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0xe389: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0xe3d6: I'm sorry...
0xe3ed: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0xe449: Okay, Snake...I understand.  War's not a game.
0xe485: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0xe4f6: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0xe56d: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0xe5c5: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0xe67c: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0xe6cd: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0xe74b: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0xe7be: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0xe813: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0xe891: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0xe924: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0xe955: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0xe9d9: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0xea5c: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0xeae8: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0xeb6d: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0xec10: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0xec85: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0xed48: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0xed8b: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0xedff: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0xee5b: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0xeeb3: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0xef5f: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0xefb0: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0xf02e: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0xf096: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0xf0eb: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0xf15e: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0xf1f1: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0xf222: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0xf29b: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0xf31e: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0xf39f: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0xf424: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0xf4bc: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0xf531: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0xf5e9: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0xf62c: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0xf6a0: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0xf707: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0xf742: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0xf7a5: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0xf81a: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0xf870: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0xf8ec: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0xf929: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0xf98d: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0xf9ef: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0xfa33: I don't know about that...
0xfa58: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0xfac7: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0xfafd: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0xfb4c: And how do I do that?
0xfb6c: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0xfbd0: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0xfc3c: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0xfca6: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0xfcfe: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0xfd4e: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0xfdda: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0xfe6b: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0xfec1: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0xff36: You should think about that, Snake.
0xff82: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0xffc8: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x1001d: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x10084: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x100d1: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x1013c: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x1019c: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x101c7: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x10240: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x1027d: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x102c4: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x1033c: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x103a8: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x10412: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x1045f: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x104af: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x1053b: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x105c1: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x10617: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x1068c: You should think about that, Snake.
0x106cd: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x10713: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x10768: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x107c4: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x10811: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x10871: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x108d1: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x108fc: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x109b5: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x109ec: Good luck, Snake.
0x10a1b: Be careful, Snake.
0x10a58: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x10b08: ..........
0x10b2f: ..........
0x10b96: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x10bea: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x10c64: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x10d1f: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x10db3: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x10e42: Look at the radar! It's picking up the DARPA chief. He's the green dot. Hurry and rescue him.
0x10f0f: Snake, you can't use your radar in that area. There's some kind of electronic jamming coming from there...I wonder what it is. Anyway, be careful.
0x10fd9: DO NOT SAVE

0x11593: This warining should not appear!!
0x115f7: Be careful, Snake.
0x11647: What can I do for you, Snake?
0x11682: What is it, Snake?
0x116b2: You called, Snake?
0x116e2: What's up, Snake?
0x1171c: ..........
0x11737: DO NOT SAVE

0x1204e: This warining should not appear!!
0x120cf: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said "The graveyards are full of indispensable men."
0x12135: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0x121bf: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0x1220e: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0x12275: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0x1231e: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0x12386: Well...I'll think about it.
0x123ea: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0x12419: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Naomi said?
0x12479: "He that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death." Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0x1255f: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x125d2: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x12627: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x126b8: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x1272d: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x12792: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x12818: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x128af: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x1295c: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0x129ad: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0x12a33: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0x12a9d: You're watching everything?
0x12ac3: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0x12b19: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0x12b60: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0x12bbb: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x12c00: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x12cc3: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x12d22: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x12d9e: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x12e6a: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x12f02: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x12fb1: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x12ff6: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x130b7: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0x13111: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x1315f: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0x131a9: But you have no choice, Snake.
0x131d2: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep  putting things in my pocket.
0x13265: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0x132a5: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0x132e6: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."
0x1333b: What's that supposed to mean?
0x13363: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0x133dc: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0x13422: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x13495: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x134ea: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x13570: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x135e5: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x1364a: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x136c5: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x1375c: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x137eb: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x1384a: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x138c6: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x13987: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x13a1f: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x13ac3: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x13b08: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x13be1: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy."
0x13c41: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0x13cd4: Snake,"This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise."
0x13d2d: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0x13de8: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x13e27: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x13e6e: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x13eb1: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x13ef5: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x13f89: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x13fe9: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x1405d: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x14096: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0x14117: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x1417c: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x141e2: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x14213: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x1426c: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x142c9: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x14359: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x14396: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x1440e: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x1444c: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x144b2: You can say that again.
0x144f2: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x14524: Why do you ask?
0x1453e: I like to play fighting games.
0x14567: Games?
0x14578: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x14621: Not a very good job, huh.
0x14645: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x146ad: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x146fa: I'm sorry...
0x14711: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x1476d: Okay, Snake...I understand.  War's not a game.
0x147a9: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x1481a: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0x14891: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x148e9: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x149a0: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x149f1: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x14a6f: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x14ae2: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x14b37: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x14bb5: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x14c48: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x14c79: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x14cfd: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x14d80: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x14e0c: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x14e91: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x14f34: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x14fa9: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x1506c: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x150af: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x15123: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x1517f: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x151d7: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x15283: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x152d4: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x15352: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x153ba: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x1540f: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x15482: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x15515: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x15546: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x155bf: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x15642: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x156c3: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x15748: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x157e0: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x15855: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x1590d: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x15950: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x159c4: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x15a2b: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0x15a66: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0x15ac9: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0x15b3e: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0x15b94: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0x15c10: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0x15c4d: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0x15cb1: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0x15d13: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0x15d57: I don't know about that...
0x15d7c: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0x15deb: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0x15e21: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0x15e70: And how do I do that?
0x15e90: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0x15ef4: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x15f60: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x15fca: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x16022: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x16072: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x160fe: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x1618f: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x161e5: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x1625a: You should think about that, Snake.
0x162a6: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x162ec: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x16341: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x163a8: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x163f5: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x16460: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x164c0: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x164eb: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x16564: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x165a1: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x165e8: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x16660: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x166cc: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x16736: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x16783: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x167d3: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x1685f: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x168e5: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x1693b: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x169b0: You should think about that, Snake.
0x169f1: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x16a37: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x16a8c: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x16ae8: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x16b35: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x16b95: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x16bf5: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x16c20: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x16cd9: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x16d10: Good luck, Snake.
0x16d3f: Be careful, Snake.
0x16d7c: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x16e2c: ..........
0x16e53: ..........
0x16eba: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x16f0e: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x16f88: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x17043: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x170d7: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x17179: The DARPA Chief. Poor man...he has a heart attack right after you save him...
0x171f2: I'm getting a bad feeling about this, Snake. Maybe you should let me save your mission.
0x1726e: DO NOT SAVE

0x17828: This warining should not appear!!
0x1788c: ..........
0x178c2: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.

0x17adf: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x17b81: Snake, you can't use the radar because something's jamming it.
0x17bcd: And whatever's doing it is very close to you. Be careful!
0x17c28: DO NOT SAVE

0x181e2: This warining should not appear!!
0x18246: Be careful, Snake.
0x18296: What can I do for you, Snake?
0x182d1: What is it, Snake?
0x18301: You called, Snake?
0x18331: What's up, Snake?
0x1836b: ..........

0x19d60: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x19dae: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...

0x1a0e4: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x1a139: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x1a1bf: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x1a234: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x1a299: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x1a314: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x1a3ab: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x1a43a: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x1a499: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x1a515: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x1a5d6: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x1a66e: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x1a712: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x1a757: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x1a830: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy."
0x1a890: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0x1a923: Snake,"This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise."
0x1a97c: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0x1aa37: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x1aa76: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x1aabd: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x1ab00: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x1ab44: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x1abd8: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x1ac38: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x1acac: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x1ace5: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0x1ad66: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x1adcb: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x1ae31: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x1ae62: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x1aebb: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x1af18: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x1afa8: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x1afe5: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x1b05d: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x1b09b: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x1b101: You can say that again.
0x1b141: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x1b173: Why do you ask?
0x1b18d: I like to play fighting games.
0x1b1b6: Games?
0x1b1c7: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x1b270: Not a very good job, huh.
0x1b294: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x1b2fc: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x1b349: I'm sorry...
0x1b360: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x1b3bc: Okay, Snake...I understand.  War's not a game.
0x1b3f8: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x1b469: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0x1b4e0: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x1b538: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x1b5ef: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x1b640: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x1b6be: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x1b731: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x1b786: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x1b804: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x1b897: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x1b8c8: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x1b94c: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x1b9cf: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x1ba5b: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x1bae0: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x1bb83: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x1bbf8: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x1bcbb: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x1bcfe: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x1bd72: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x1bdce: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x1be26: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x1bed2: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x1bf23: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x1bfa1: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x1c009: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x1c05e: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x1c0d1: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x1c164: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x1c195: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x1c20e: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x1c291: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x1c312: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x1c397: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x1c42f: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x1c4a4: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x1c55c: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x1c59f: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x1c613: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x1c67a: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0x1c6b5: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0x1c718: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0x1c78d: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0x1c7e3: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0x1c85f: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0x1c89c: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0x1c900: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0x1c962: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0x1c9a6: I don't know about that...
0x1c9cb: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0x1ca3a: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0x1ca70: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0x1cabf: And how do I do that?
0x1cadf: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0x1cb43: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x1cbaf: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x1cc19: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x1cc71: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x1ccc1: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x1cd4d: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x1cdde: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x1ce34: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x1cea9: You should think about that, Snake.
0x1cef5: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x1cf3b: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x1cf90: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x1cff7: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x1d044: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x1d0af: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x1d10f: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x1d13a: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x1d1b3: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x1d1f0: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x1d237: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x1d2af: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x1d31b: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x1d385: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x1d3d2: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x1d422: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x1d4ae: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x1d534: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x1d58a: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x1d5ff: You should think about that, Snake.
0x1d640: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x1d686: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x1d6db: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x1d737: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x1d784: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x1d7e4: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x1d844: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x1d86f: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x1d928: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x1d95f: Good luck, Snake.
0x1d98e: Be careful, Snake.
0x1d9cb: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x1da7b: ..........
0x1daa2: ..........
0x1db09: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x1db5d: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x1dbd7: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x1dc92: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x1dd26: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x1ddc8: Snake, you can't use your radar.  It's confused by all of the radio interference. That ninja is giving off some kind of electrical energy!
0x1de7a: DO NOT SAVE

0x1e434: This warining should not appear!!
0x1e498: Win Snake! Win!
0x1e4d2: Snake, are you okay?
0x1e504: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x1e537: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x1e574: Snake...
0x1e58d: DO NOT SAVE

0x1eb47: This warining should not appear!!
0x1ebb7: Don't give up!
0x1ebe3: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x1ec1c: Win Snake! Win!
0x1ec49: Don't die, Snake!
0x1ec78: Do it for me! Snake!
0x1ecbc: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x1ed10: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x1ed8a: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x1ee45: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x1eed9: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x1ef7b: Snake! That's a ladies bathroom!
0x1efa6: I know that. I saw Meryl come in here.
0x1efd7: So you went in after her!? Are you some kind of pervert!? I won't let you save your mission now!
0x1f048: Listen Mei Ling, this is the only place on this base that I can talk to Meryl alone!
0x1f0ad: Whatever, weirdo! Don't call me again!
0x1f10a: ..........
0x1f135: DO NOT SAVE

0x1f6ef: This warining should not appear!!
0x1f753: ..........
0x1f789: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x1f7dd: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x1f857: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x1f912: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x1f9a6: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x1fa6f: She'll die if you leave her like that! Aren't you going to save her!?
0x1fac2: She's just bait...it's me they want. If I step out there, I'm going to get picked off and who's going to save Meryl then!?
0x1fb50: I'm hoping that as long as I don't fall for it, they'll leave Meryl alive.
0x1fba8: So you're just going to leave Meryl there? She's hurt!
0x1fbec: I know what I'm doing.  Meryl understands too.
0x1fc28: That's horrible...
0x1fc45: You're right. It is horrible. But that's war. And the first rule of war is to stay alive.
0x1fcd3: DO NOT SAVE

0x2028d: This warining should not appear!!
0x202f1: ..........
0x20326: How can I help, Snake?
0x2035a: Snake, just tell me.  I'll do anything to help.
0x203aa: Snake, how are you holding up?
0x203e6: Did you call, Snake?
0x2040b: DO NOT SAVE

0x209c5: This warining should not appear!!
0x20a35: Please Snake, don't give up.
0x20a6f: Come back alive, Snake...
0x20aa6: Snake, it's all up to you...
0x20aed: ! Snake!
0x20b2e: Snake, your Soliton radar...
0x20b55: I know. I can't use it in a narrow space like this, right?
0x20b9d: Right. I'm sorry.
0x20bb9: No reason to apologize. Even the greatest masterpiece has its flaws.
0x20c2f: DO NOT SAVE

0x21546: This warining should not appear!!
0x215c7: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said "The graveyards are full of indispensable men."
0x2162d: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0x216b7: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0x21706: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0x2176d: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0x21816: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0x2187e: Well...I'll think about it.
0x218e2: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0x21911: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Naomi said?
0x21971: "He that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death." Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0x21a57: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x21aca: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x21b1f: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x21bb0: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x21c25: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x21c8a: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x21d10: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x21da7: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x21e54: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0x21ea5: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0x21f2b: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0x21f95: You're watching everything?
0x21fbb: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0x22011: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0x22058: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0x220b3: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x220f8: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x221bb: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x2221a: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x22296: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x22362: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x223fa: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x224a9: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x224ee: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x225af: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0x22609: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x22657: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0x226a1: But you have no choice, Snake.
0x226ca: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep  putting things in my pocket.
0x2275d: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0x2279d: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0x227de: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."
0x22833: What's that supposed to mean?
0x2285b: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0x228d4: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0x2291a: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x2298d: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x229e2: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x22a68: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x22add: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x22b42: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x22bbd: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x22c54: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x22ce3: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x22d42: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x22dbe: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x22e7f: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x22f17: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x22fbb: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x23000: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x230d9: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy."
0x23139: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0x231cc: Snake,"This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise."
0x23225: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0x232e0: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x2331f: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x23366: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x233a9: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x233ed: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x23481: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x234e1: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x23555: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x2358e: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0x2360f: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x23674: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x236da: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x2370b: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x23764: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x237c1: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x23851: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x2388e: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x23906: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x23944: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x239aa: You can say that again.
0x239ea: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x23a1c: Why do you ask?
0x23a36: I like to play fighting games.
0x23a5f: Games?
0x23a70: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x23b19: Not a very good job, huh.
0x23b3d: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x23ba5: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x23bf2: I'm sorry...
0x23c09: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x23c65: Okay, Snake...I understand.  War's not a game.
0x23ca1: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x23d12: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0x23d89: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x23de1: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x23e98: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x23ee9: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x23f67: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x23fda: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x2402f: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x240ad: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x24140: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x24171: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x241f5: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x24278: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x24304: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x24389: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x2442c: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x244a1: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x24564: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x245a7: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x2461b: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x24677: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x246cf: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x2477b: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x247cc: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x2484a: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x248b2: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x24907: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x2497a: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x24a0d: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x24a3e: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x24ab7: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x24b3a: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x24bbb: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x24c40: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x24cd8: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x24d4d: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x24e05: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x24e48: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x24ebc: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x24f23: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0x24f5e: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0x24fc1: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0x25036: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0x2508c: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0x25108: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0x25145: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0x251a9: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0x2520b: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0x2524f: I don't know about that...
0x25274: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0x252e3: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0x25319: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0x25368: And how do I do that?
0x25388: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0x253ec: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x25458: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x254c2: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x2551a: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x2556a: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x255f6: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x25687: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x256dd: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x25752: You should think about that, Snake.
0x2579e: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x257e4: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x25839: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x258a0: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x258ed: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x25958: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x259b8: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x259e3: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x25a5c: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x25a99: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x25ae0: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x25b58: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x25bc4: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x25c2e: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x25c7b: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x25ccb: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x25d57: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x25ddd: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x25e33: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x25ea8: You should think about that, Snake.
0x25ee9: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x25f2f: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x25f84: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x25fe0: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x2602d: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x2608d: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x260ed: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x26118: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x261d1: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x26208: Good luck, Snake.
0x26237: Be careful, Snake.
0x26274: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x26324: ..........
0x2634b: ..........
0x263c2: What can I do for you, Snake?
0x263fd: What is it, Snake?
0x2642d: You called, Snake?
0x2645d: What's up, Snake?
0x26497: ..........
0x264b2: DO NOT SAVE

0x26dc9: This warining should not appear!!
0x26e4a: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said "The graveyards are full of indispensable men."
0x26eb0: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0x26f3a: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0x26f89: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0x26ff0: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0x27099: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0x27101: Well...I'll think about it.
0x27165: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0x27194: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Naomi said?
0x271f4: "He that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death." Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0x272da: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x2734d: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x273a2: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x27433: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x274a8: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x2750d: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x27593: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x2762a: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x276d7: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0x27728: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0x277ae: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0x27818: You're watching everything?
0x2783e: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0x27894: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0x278db: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0x27936: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x2797b: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x27a3e: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x27a9d: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x27b19: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x27be5: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x27c7d: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x27d2c: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x27d71: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x27e32: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0x27e8c: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x27eda: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0x27f24: But you have no choice, Snake.
0x27f4d: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep  putting things in my pocket.
0x27fe0: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0x28020: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0x28061: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."
0x280b6: What's that supposed to mean?
0x280de: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0x28157: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0x2819d: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x28210: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x28265: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x282eb: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x28360: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x283c5: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x28440: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x284d7: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x28566: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x285c5: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x28641: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x28702: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x2879a: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x2883e: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x28883: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x2895c: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy."
0x289bc: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0x28a4f: Snake,"This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise."
0x28aa8: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0x28b63: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x28ba2: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x28be9: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x28c2c: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x28c70: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x28d04: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x28d64: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x28dd8: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x28e11: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0x28e92: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x28ef7: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x28f5d: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x28f8e: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x28fe7: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x29044: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x290d4: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x29111: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x29189: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x291c7: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x2922d: You can say that again.
0x2926d: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x2929f: Why do you ask?
0x292b9: I like to play fighting games.
0x292e2: Games?
0x292f3: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x2939c: Not a very good job, huh.
0x293c0: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x29428: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x29475: I'm sorry...
0x2948c: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x294e8: Okay, Snake...I understand.  War's not a game.
0x29524: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x29595: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0x2960c: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x29664: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x2971b: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x2976c: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x297ea: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x2985d: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x298b2: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x29930: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x299c3: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x299f4: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x29a78: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x29afb: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x29b87: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x29c0c: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x29caf: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x29d24: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x29de7: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x29e2a: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x29e9e: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x29efa: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x29f52: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x29ffe: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x2a04f: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x2a0cd: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x2a135: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x2a18a: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x2a1fd: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x2a290: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x2a2c1: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x2a33a: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x2a3bd: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x2a43e: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x2a4c3: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x2a55b: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x2a5d0: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x2a688: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x2a6cb: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.

0x2ae79: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x2af0a: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x2af60: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x2afd5: You should think about that, Snake.
0x2b021: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x2b067: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x2b0bc: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x2b123: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x2b170: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x2b1db: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x2b23b: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x2b266: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x2b2df: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x2b31c: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x2b363: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x2b3db: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x2b447: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x2b4b1: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x2b4fe: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x2b54e: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x2b5da: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x2b660: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x2b6b6: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x2b72b: You should think about that, Snake.
0x2b76c: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x2b7b2: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x2b807: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x2b863: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x2b8b0: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x2b910: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x2b970: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x2b99b: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x2ba54: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x2ba8b: Good luck, Snake.
0x2baba: Be careful, Snake.
0x2baf7: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x2bba7: ..........
0x2bbce: ..........
0x2bc35: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x2bc89: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x2bd03: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x2bdbe: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x2be52: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x2bee1: Snake, wouldn't now be a good time to save your mission?
0x2bf5f: You haven't saved your mission in a long time anyway, right?
0x2bfb7: What's going on?
0x2bfd2: I'm not sure...I'm getting a bad feeling.
0x2c006: A bad feeling? Something you ate?
0x2c032: No, I'm serious...like a premonition or something...
0x2c09a: DO NOT SAVE

0x2c654: This warining should not appear!!
0x2c6b8: Snake, it's all up to you...
0x2c700: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x2c754: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x2c7ce: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x2c889: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x2c91d: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x2c9f9: You found out where the DARPA Chief is! With his nanomachine transmitter, he should show up as a green dot on your radar when you get close.
0x2ca99: Try to find him.
0x2cac8: DO NOT SAVE

0x2d082: This warining should not appear!!
0x2d0e6: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x2d141: Look at the radar! It's picking up the DARPA chief. He's the green dot. Hurry and rescue him.
0x2d1d3: DO NOT SAVE

0x2d78d: This warining should not appear!!
0x2d7f1: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x2d915: Snake, are you okay?
0x2d947: Are you hurt, Snake!?

0x2d9b7: Snake...

0x2e0bb: Do it for me! Snake!
0x2e128: Snake, are you okay?
0x2e15a: Are you hurt, Snake!?

0x2e89f: Don't die, Snake!
0x2e8ce: Do it for me! Snake!
0x2e94c: Mei Ling, how can someone outside of this operation cut into my Codec?
0x2e9a0: You're talking about that guy calling himself Deepthroat. We were monitoring from here.
0x2ea08: What about it?
0x2ea21: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it. ...it's top secret information...
0x2eaba: Can you tell where he called from?
0x2eae7: I'm sorry. The signal is too weak to locate its source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on the base.
0x2eb77: DO NOT SAVE

0x2f131: This warining should not appear!!
0x2f195: Be careful, Snake.
0x2f20f: Mei Ling, how can someone outside of this operation cut into my Codec?

0x2f2cb: What about it?
0x2f2e4: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it. ...it's top secret information...
0x2f37d: Can you tell where he called from?
0x2f3aa: I'm sorry. The signal is too weak to locate its source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on the base.
0x2f43a: DO NOT SAVE

0x2f9f4: This warining should not appear!!
0x2fa58: Be careful, Snake.
0x2fac2: Snake, there's an old Chinese saying "A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar."
0x2fb4d: Einstein said it another way. He said that only a life lived for others is worth living.
0x2fbb6: That's why I entered MIT instead of Princeton or Vassar like my friends.
0x2fc0c: I wanted to do applied physics, not just theoretical stuff. I wanted to make things for people.
0x2fc7c: The Soliton Radar System or the Codec System...I just wanted to make something that would be useful for people.
0x2fcff: I think that it was the same for Dr. Emmerich too.
0x2fd3f: But he was used like a tool...used to make a horrible killing machine.
0x2fd93: Maybe it would be better if engineers like us just stopped making things... I don't know.
0x2fe11: DO NOT SAVE

0x303cb: This warining should not appear!!
0x3042f: ..........
0x30491: It's a good thing you hooked up with Meryl...
0x304cc: You should have seen the Colonel. He doesn't like to let it show cause he's the boss, but he was so happy he could barely contain himself.
0x3056a: I'm glad to hear that.
0x305a9: DO NOT SAVE

0x30b63: This warining should not appear!!
0x30bc7: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x30c39: "The tongues of dying men enforce attention, like deep harmony."
0x30c88: Snake, people don't normally lie with their dying breaths. I think he was telling the truth. Maybe you should believe him.
0x30d2a: DO NOT SAVE

0x312e4: This warining should not appear!!
0x31348: Please Snake, don't give up.
0x313c6: She'll die if you leave her like that! Aren't you going to save her!?
0x31419: She's just bait...it's me they want. If I step out there, I'm going to get picked off and who's going to save Meryl then!?
0x314a7: I'm hoping that as long as I don't fall for it, they'll leave Meryl alive.
0x314ff: So you're just going to leave Meryl there? She's hurt!
0x31543: I know what I'm doing.  Meryl understands too.
0x3157f: That's horrible...
0x3159c: You're right. It is horrible. But that's war. And the first rule of war is to stay alive.
0x3161a: DO NOT SAVE

0x31c77: Snake, wouldn't now be a good time to save your mission?

0x31d4d: What's going on?
0x31d68: I'm not sure...I'm getting a bad feeling.

0x3244e: Snake, it's all up to you...
0x324a8: What can I do for you, Snake?
0x324e3: What is it, Snake?
0x32513: You called, Snake?
0x32543: What's up, Snake?
0x3257d: ..........
0x32598: DO NOT SAVE

0x32eaf: This warining should not appear!!
0x32f30: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said "The graveyards are full of indispensable men."
0x32f96: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0x33020: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0x3306f: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0x330d6: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0x3317f: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0x331e7: Well...I'll think about it.
0x3324b: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0x3327a: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Naomi said?
0x332da: "He that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death." Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0x333c0: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x33433: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x33488: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x33519: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x3358e: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x335f3: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x33679: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x33710: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x337bd: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0x3380e: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0x33894: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0x338fe: You're watching everything?
0x33924: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0x3397a: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0x339c1: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0x33a1c: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x33a61: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x33b24: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x33b83: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x33bff: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x33ccb: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x33d63: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x33e12: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x33e57: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x33f18: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0x33f72: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x33fc0: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0x3400a: But you have no choice, Snake.
0x34033: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep  putting things in my pocket.
0x340c6: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0x34106: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0x34147: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."
0x3419c: What's that supposed to mean?
0x341c4: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0x3423d: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0x34283: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x342f6: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x3434b: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x343d1: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x34446: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x344ab: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x34526: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x345bd: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x3464c: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x346ab: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x34727: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x347e8: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x34880: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x34924: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x34969: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x34a42: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy."
0x34aa2: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0x34b35: Snake,"This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise."
0x34b8e: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0x34c49: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x34c88: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x34ccf: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x34d12: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x34d56: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x34dea: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x34e4a: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x34ebe: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x34ef7: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0x34f78: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x34fdd: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x35043: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x35074: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x350cd: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x3512a: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x351ba: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x351f7: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x3526f: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x352ad: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x35313: You can say that again.
0x35353: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x35385: Why do you ask?
0x3539f: I like to play fighting games.
0x353c8: Games?
0x353d9: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x35482: Not a very good job, huh.
0x354a6: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x3550e: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x3555b: I'm sorry...
0x35572: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x355ce: Okay, Snake...I understand.  War's not a game.
0x3560a: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x3567b: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0x356f2: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x3574a: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x35801: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x35852: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x358d0: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x35943: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x35998: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x35a16: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x35aa9: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x35ada: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x35b5e: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x35be1: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x35c6d: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x35cf2: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x35d95: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x35e0a: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x35ecd: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x35f10: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x35f84: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x35fe0: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x36038: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x360e4: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x36135: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x361b3: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x3621b: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x36270: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x362e3: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x36376: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x363a7: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x36420: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x364a3: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x36524: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x365a9: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x36641: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x366b6: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x3676e: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x367b1: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x36825: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x3688c: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0x368c7: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0x3692a: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0x3699f: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0x369f5: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0x36a71: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0x36aae: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0x36b12: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0x36b74: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0x36bb8: I don't know about that...
0x36bdd: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0x36c4c: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0x36c82: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0x36cd1: And how do I do that?
0x36cf1: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0x36d55: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x36dc1: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x36e2b: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x36e83: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x36ed3: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x36f5f: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x36ff0: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x37046: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x370bb: You should think about that, Snake.
0x37107: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x3714d: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x371a2: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x37209: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x37256: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x372c1: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x37321: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x3734c: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x373c5: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x37402: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x37449: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x374c1: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x3752d: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x37597: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x375e4: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x37634: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x376c0: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x37746: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x3779c: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x37811: You should think about that, Snake.
0x37852: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x37898: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x378ed: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x37949: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x37996: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x379f6: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x37a56: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x37a81: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x37b3a: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x37b71: Good luck, Snake.
0x37ba0: Be careful, Snake.
0x37bdd: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x37c8d: ..........
0x37cb4: ..........
0x37d1b: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x37d6f: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x37de9: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x37ea4: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x37f38: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x380ed: Snake, are you okay?
0x3811f: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x38152: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x3818f: Snake...
0x381a8: DO NOT SAVE

0x38762: This warining should not appear!!
0x387d2: Don't give up!
0x387fe: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x38837: Win Snake! Win!
0x38864: Don't die, Snake!
0x38893: Do it for me! Snake!
0x388e8: In China they say "It's better to live ugly than to die beautiful."
0x3893b: I think it's true. Once you're dead, you'll never have another chance to be happy. I can't understand people who want to die before their time.
0x389de: Please Snake...promise me that you'll come back alive.
0x38a4f: DO NOT SAVE

0x39009: This warining should not appear!!
0x3906d: ..........
0x390cf: Mei Ling, how's Naomi?
0x390f0: Huh? She's fine, I guess. What's up?
0x3911f: Oh...
0x3912f: What do you want, Snake? If you want to talk to Naomi, why don't you call her?
0x39198: Oh it's nothing...forget about it.
0x391c5: Strange guy...
0x391f2: DO NOT SAVE

0x397ac: This warining should not appear!!
0x39810: Good luck, Snake.
0x39879: ...Naomi wasn't acting strangely or anything?
0x398b4: No...I just can't believe that Naomi's an enemy spy. I refuse to accept that.
0x3990f: I don't want to believe it either, but...
0x39943: Don't say it, Snake.
0x39976: DO NOT SAVE

0x39f30: This warining should not appear!!
0x39f94: ..........
0x39ff6: Snake, Naomi's under arrest...
0x3a01f: What the hell is happening over there?
0x3a053: What's the Colonel thinking?
0x3a07a: Campbell is...
0x3a093: I'm sorry. I can't say any more.
0x3a0be: But please believe me. I'm here to help you. Until the end...
0x3a11d: DO NOT SAVE

0x3a6d7: This warining should not appear!!
0x3a73b: Please Snake, don't give up.
0x3a7b6: How can I help, Snake?
0x3a7ea: Snake, just tell me.  I'll do anything to help.
0x3a83a: Snake, how are you holding up?
0x3a876: Did you call, Snake?
0x3a89b: DO NOT SAVE

0x3ae55: This warining should not appear!!
0x3aec5: Please Snake, don't give up.
0x3aeff: Come back alive, Snake...
0x3af36: Snake, it's all up to you...
0x3af7d: ! Snake!
0x3afd0: Snake, there's nothing I can do to help you. All I can do is to cheer you on!
0x3b05c: Snake, are you okay?
0x3b08e: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x3b0b6: DO NOT SAVE

0x3b670: This warining should not appear!!
0x3b6e0: Don't give up!
0x3b70c: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x3b745: Win Snake! Win!
0x3b772: Don't die, Snake!
0x3b7a1: Do it for me! Snake!
0x3b7ee: Mei Ling, I don't think I can go through all that again. Please save the mission.
0x3b850: Okay, Snake, I'll take care of it.
0x3b8af: Snake, they've placed the Colonel under arrest. I don't know what I should do. This will probably be your last save.
0x3b937: I'm going to miss those proverbs of yours.
0x3b96f: Snake...
0x3b982: Mei Ling, I have a favor to ask you.
0x3b9b1: Make a hard copy of all the Codec conversation data up to this point. I want some insurance.
0x3ba1e: Okay, Snake. Leave it to me.
0x3ba59: DO NOT SAVE

0x3c013: This warining should not appear!!
0x3c077: Snake, please. Be safe...for me.
0x3c0d2: Snake, are you okay?
0x3c104: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x3c137: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x3c174: Snake...
0x3c18d: DO NOT SAVE

0x3c747: This warining should not appear!!
0x3c7b7: Don't give up!
0x3c7e3: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x3c81c: Win Snake! Win!
0x3c849: Don't die, Snake!
0x3c878: Do it for me! Snake!
0x3c8ce: What can I do for you, Snake?
0x3c909: What is it, Snake?
0x3c939: You called, Snake?
0x3c969: What's up, Snake?
0x3c9a3: ..........
0x3c9be: DO NOT SAVE

0x3d2d5: This warining should not appear!!
0x3d356: Snake, remember what De Gaulle said "The graveyards are full of indispensable men."
0x3d3bc: Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.
0x3d446: You're right. Wow. You know all sorts of great quotes, don't you?
0x3d495: Well, both my parents are from Guangdong, China, but I was born and raised in America.
0x3d4fc: I've always liked reading literature from both sides...kinda keeps me in touch. I'll share some more quotes with you if you like.
0x3d5a5: I'm looking forward to it. But to tell you the truth, I'd like to learn more about you.
0x3d60d: Well...I'll think about it.
0x3d671: Snake! Are you smoking a cigarette!?
0x3d6a0: Cigarettes are poison...they kill people. Didn't you hear what Dr. Naomi said?
0x3d700: "He that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death." Is that why you smoke, Snake? You're too afraid of life?
0x3d7e6: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x3d859: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x3d8ae: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x3d93f: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x3d9b4: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x3da19: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x3da9f: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x3db36: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x3dbe3: How's it going, Snake? Have you gotten used to using the radar yet?
0x3dc34: Yeah. It's a great system. Not only can I read the topography, but I can monitor the movement of the bad guys too.
0x3dcba: Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it easy for us to see everything that you're doing.
0x3dd24: You're watching everything?
0x3dd4a: Of course. If you were my boyfriend, you'd never be able to cheat on me.
0x3dda0: Being monitored 24 hours a day...that would be like hell.
0x3dde7: Don't think of it like that. At least you'd never get lost.
0x3de42: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x3de87: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x3df4a: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x3dfa9: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x3e025: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x3e0f1: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x3e189: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x3e238: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x3e27d: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x3e33e: I wish I could send you weapons through this Codec, instead of just data.
0x3e398: That would be nice. I'm starting to feel like a thief already...
0x3e3e6: Ransacking rooms, rifling through fallen enemies' pockets...
0x3e430: But you have no choice, Snake.
0x3e459: Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to develop kleptomania. I just keep  putting things in my pocket.
0x3e4ec: Have you ever heard this one? Confucius said it...
0x3e52c: Enough proverbs for now. I want to hear about you.
0x3e56d: "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."
0x3e5c2: What's that supposed to mean?
0x3e5ea: It means I hardly know you, Snake. It wouldn't be right to start telling you all about my personal life.
0x3e663: Okay...but I'm not giving up.
0x3e6a9: Snake, listen to what Lao-Tze said "He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough."
0x3e71c: Just cause you see an item doesn't mean that you always have to get it.
0x3e771: If you don't really need it, think twice before you stick your neck out. It might not be worth it.
0x3e7f7: Snake, like Shakespeare said "Nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content."
0x3e86c: Basically, it means that your desire can get you into trouble if you're not careful.
0x3e8d1: That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful, Snake.
0x3e94c: Snake, in China they say "You must cross the river before you tell the crocodile he has bad breath." Do you know what that means?
0x3e9e3: It means that the wise man avoids danger first. Use your brain to avoid traps and stay away from the enemy.
0x3ea72: Snake, have you ever heard the saying "Friendly counsel cuts off many foes"?
0x3ead1: It means that a little bit of advice from friends can save you a lot of trouble. You should think about it.
0x3eb4d: If you're in trouble or if you need some information about something, please contact Colonel Campbell or someone else. Okay?
0x3ec0e: In my parents' homeland they say "If there are more wolves, the people are eaten; If there are more people, the wolves are eaten."
0x3eca6: That means the side with greater numbers is usually the winner. You're badly outnumbered Snake...try not to let them see you.
0x3ed4a: Snake, like Confucius said "The cautious seldom err."
0x3ed8f: If you proceed cautiously, you probably won't make a big mistake. Snake, even after you get used to the mission, don't lose your concentration.
0x3ee68: "O, he's a limb, that has but a disease; mortal, to cut it off; to cure it easy."
0x3eec8: Snake. You caught a cold, didn't you? Don't you think you'd better take some cold medicine at least?
0x3ef5b: Snake,"This sickness doth infect. The very life-blood of our enterprise."
0x3efb4: That's from Henry IV. Snake, you'd better take that cold medicine and start feeling better. The success of this mission may depend on it.
0x3f06f: Mei Ling, how did you get into this line of work?
0x3f0ae: The truth is...I always wanted to become a fighter pilot.
0x3f0f5: I fell in love with jets watching them in the movies.
0x3f138: You'd be surprised how many people say the same thing.
0x3f17c: But I didn't want to kill people. That's when I heard that the US Air Force needed people to do BDAs, battle damage assessments.
0x3f210: Those are the guys whose job it is to confirm how successful a bombing run was.
0x3f270: Yeah. So I started to do research into aerial photography and air intelligence. I made it my major.
0x3f2e4: But there are no pilots who only do BDAs...
0x3f31d: That's right. But by the time I learned that, I was already an expert in my field.
0x3f39e: Mei Ling, you said that you wanted to become a pilot. Did you take an aptitude test?
0x3f403: Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact lenses.
0x3f469: So you failed your aptitude test, huh?
0x3f49a: Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying around in biplanes anymore, y'know.
0x3f4f3: That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that go several times the speed of sound.
0x3f550: Exactly. At those speeds, the naked eye isn't that useful. You need sophisticated electronics to see what's really going on.
0x3f5e0: So is that why you developed your radar system?
0x3f61d: Yeah. I wanted to develop a radar system that would help soldiers make better, more informed decisions.
0x3f695: So your radar shows what's really going on, huh?
0x3f6d3: It depends on how you interpret it. Like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
0x3f739: You can say that again.
0x3f779: Snake, what does it feel like to fight?
0x3f7ab: Why do you ask?
0x3f7c5: I like to play fighting games.
0x3f7ee: Games?
0x3f7ff: Yeah. Fighting games. Since I started this job, I've seen so many people kill each other. But I always see it on a monitor, or in burst transmission.
0x3f8a8: Not a very good job, huh.
0x3f8cc: I'm not sure. When you watch it on a monitor, it starts to feel just like a video game.
0x3f934: This is no game! There are no startovers if you make a mistake.
0x3f981: I'm sorry...
0x3f998: Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either, like it looks in those video games.
0x3f9f4: Okay, Snake...I understand.  War's not a game.
0x3fa30: Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is over, I want you to go back to being a normal student.
0x3faa1: You should be having fun...playing real video games instead of playing war.
0x3fb18: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x3fb70: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x3fc27: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x3fc78: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x3fcf6: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x3fd69: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x3fdbe: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x3fe3c: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x3fecf: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x3ff00: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x3ff84: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x40007: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x40093: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x40118: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x401bb: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x40230: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x402f3: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x40336: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x403aa: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x40406: In China, they say "Rashness brings success to few, misfortune to many."
0x4045e: Snake, go forward when it's safe, but retreat when there's danger. You'll just have to play it by ear depending on the circumstances.
0x4050a: The Chinese say "It is the strong swimmer who most often drowns."
0x4055b: It is because the strong swimmer overestimates his abilities and underestimates the strength of the river.
0x405d9: You are probably quite used to the mission now, but don't get careless.
0x40641: There's a Chinese proverb "The mind cannot be in two places at once."
0x40696: Make sure that you're not thinking of something else during the mission, okay?
0x40709: "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still aflying, and this same flower, that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."
0x4079c: Snake, laughter is the best medicine. 
0x407cd: You should be happy you've got enough free time to play a game. Enjoy yourself, okay?
0x40846: In Paradise Lost, Milton wrote "Solitude sometimes is best society, and short retirement urges sweet return."
0x408c9: Is that why you came back, Snake? You got tired of your "short retirement" in Alaska, huh?
0x4094a: "The proud man does not eat rotting meat even when hungry, nor steal water from another's well when he thirsts."
0x409cf: But...on the other hand, you were forced to steal or find every item you've got, so I guess I shouldn't say that.
0x40a67: In China, they say "Once the fox gets his nose in, he'll soon find a way to make his body follow."
0x40adc: That's a perfect description of you. You can do it, Snake. But you've got to be flexible...adapt to each situation uniquely.
0x40b94: "He who is firm in will molds the world to himself."
0x40bd7: Don't forget what you're here to do. You've got to seize any opportunities that present themselves.
0x40c4b: But I guess I don't have to tell you that, do I?
0x40cb2: Don't forget to save your memories of me too.
0x40ced: You can't save memories even on that system of yours. Memories are fragile things.
0x40d50: After you reduce them to binary numbers and send them through the air, they're not memories anymore.
0x40dc5: I wouldn't be so sure of that. There's nothing that my systems can't do.
0x40e1b: Memories aren't just sounds and pictures. They exist somewhere between the sounds, between the pictures.
0x40e97: I don't get it. Anything can be done digitally.
0x40ed4: If that's true, why don't you go ahead and try to save what I'm thinking right now.
0x40f38: I can't save that type of thing. You have to put it into words at least...
0x40f9a: That's right. And that's what memories are...wordless.
0x40fde: I don't know about that...
0x41003: No matter how far data technology advances, you'll never be able to penetrate the human heart.
0x41072: You're wrong. It's just a matter of time...
0x410a8: But first you have to try to understand human emotions, Mei Ling.
0x410f7: And how do I do that?
0x41117: You have to allow yourself to fall in love with someone.
0x4117b: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x411e7: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x41251: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x412a9: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x412f9: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x41385: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x41416: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x4146c: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x414e1: You should think about that, Snake.
0x4152d: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x41573: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x415c8: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x4162f: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x4167c: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x416e7: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x41747: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x41772: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x417eb: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..."
0x41828: Have you ever heard that? It's Elizabeth Barett Browning.
0x4186f: Oh uh...don't think too deeply about that one. I'm not sure why I said it...
0x418e7: Snake, in China they say "When walking through a melon patch, don't adjust your sandals."
0x41953: That means that when things get really bad, you have to try to remember what's important.
0x419bd: Keep things in the proper perspective, okay?
0x41a0a: In China, they say "The snake, knowing itself, strikes swiftly."
0x41a5a: It means that if you have confidence that what you are doing is part of your true nature, there should be no hesitation.
0x41ae6: I don't know whether your orders are in your true nature or not. But Snake... believe in yourself!
0x41b6c: Snake, Leo Durocher said "Win any way you can. Nice guys finish last."
0x41bc2: What about you, Snake? Is that what you think? Is there anything that you wouldn't do to stay alive?
0x41c37: You should think about that, Snake.
0x41c78: Snake, don't give up. Remember Macbeth, act V, scene 3.
0x41cbe: "I'll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack'd, give me my armor."
0x41d13: Everyone is counting on you, Snake....You've got to do it!
0x41d6f: "War he sung, is toil and trouble; honor but an empty bubble."
0x41dbc: What about you, Snake? Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?
0x41e1c: Snake,"Come, what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
0x41e7c: We're almost out of time, Snake.
0x41ea7: Please hurry! You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.
0x41f60: Talk to you later, Snake.
0x41f97: Good luck, Snake.
0x41fc6: Be careful, Snake.
0x42003: C'mon, Snake. Don't call me for no reason.
0x420b3: ..........
0x420da: ..........
0x42141: I'm sorry, Snake, but I can't save your mission without a Memory card.
0x42195: If you want to save the mission, insert a Memory card into a Memory card slot.
0x4220f: I'm sorry, Snake. It looks like there are no empty save blocks. I can't save your mission if they're all full.
0x422ca: If you don't format your Memory card, I can't save your mission. Don't you want to save your mission?
0x4235e: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.

0x42408: Snake, are you okay?
0x4243a: Are you hurt, Snake!?
0x4246d: Is everything all right, Snake?
0x424aa: Snake...
0x424c3: DO NOT SAVE

0x42a7d: This warining should not appear!!
0x42aed: Don't give up!
0x42b19: C'mon Snake. You can do it!
0x42b52: Win Snake! Win!
0x42b7f: Don't die, Snake!
0x42bae: Do it for me! Snake!
0x42c0c: Snake, are you okay? I feel so scared for you. It must be horrible.
0x42c5d: I've been through a lot worse.  Believe me.
0x42c96: Wow. You really are a hero.
0x42cbc: It's a good thing the Codec is connected directly to your inner ear. You can contact us anytime.
0x42d2d: ...It's always nice to hear that you're all right.
0x42d89: Why don't you contact the Colonel? If anyone can think of a way out, it's him.
0x42df9: DO NOT SAVE

0x433b3: This warining should not appear!!
0x43417: Please Snake, don't give up.
0x43464: Mei Ling...You must think I'm garbage...
0x4349a: ...Snake, don't blame yourself too much.
0x434d0: You just...
0x434e6: I just let them kill Meryl to save my own worthless hide!
0x4352d: Listen...in China, they have a saying...
0x43560: ..........
0x43575: Forget it...I'll use my own words this time.
0x435af: Cheer up, Snake.
0x435ca: Don't listen to what he said. It's nothing but a bluff. I'm sure about that.
0x43624: I don't think he's the bluffing type...
0x43656: But, Snake. You have a job to do. Pull yourself together for the world's sake.
0x436b2: First, you've got to figure out how to get out of there.
0x436f8: ..........
0x4370d: Snake, listen to me!
0x4372c: You...you've got to pull yourself together, and get back to work.
0x4377b: You're right. I've sat here feeling sorry for myself long enough.
0x437ca: Thanks, Mei Ling...

0x44f43: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x4502b: Mei Ling, I don't think I can go through all that again. Please save the mission.
0x4508d: Okay, Snake, I'll take care of it.
0x450f0: Snake, are you okay?
0x45122: Are you hurt, Snake!?

0x46166: Sorry, Snake, I couldn't save your mission because there was some kind of error.
0x46208: Snake, there's nothing I can do to help you. All I can do is to cheer you on!

0x46a08: Mei Ling, I don't think I can go through all that again. Please save the mission.
0x46a6a: Okay, Snake, I'll take care of it.
0x46ac0: Snake, they've placed the Colonel under arrest. I don't know what I should do. This will probably be your last save.
0x46b48: I'm going to miss those proverbs of yours.
0x46b80: Snake...
0x46b93: Mei Ling, I have a favor to ask you.
0x46bc2: Make a hard copy of all the Codec conversation data up to this point. I want some insurance.
0x46c2f: Okay, Snake. Leave it to me.
0x46c6a: DO NOT SAVE

0x47224: This warining should not appear!!

0x47a54: Don't die, Snake!
0x47a83: Do it for me! Snake!
0x47ad4: This is Snake.
0x47aed: Colonel, can you hear me?
0x47b11: Loud and clear.
0x47b2b: What's the situation, Snake?
0x47b52: Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.
0x47b97: Just as I expected.
0x47bb5: You'll have to take the elevator to the surface.
0x47bf3: But make sure nobody sees you.
0x47c1c: If you need to, contact me by Codec.
0x47c4b: The frequency is 140.85.
0x47c6e: When you want to use the Codec, push the Select Button.
0x47cb3: When we need to contact you, the Codec will beep.
0x47cf2: When you hear that noise,  press the Select Button.
0x47d33: The Codec's receiver directly stimulates the small bones of your ear.
0x47d86: No one but you will be able to hear it.
0x47db8: Got it. Okay. I'm ready to go.
0x47de1: CAMPBELL
0x47e1f: It's Snake.
0x47e35: I'm in front of the disposal facility.
0x47e90: Excellent, Snake.
0x47eac: Age hasn't slowed you down one bit.
0x47eff: Thanks to the VR training I did on board the Discovery.
0x47f58: That took a long time.
0x47f79: I guess you're feeling a little rusty.
0x47faa: Don't worry.
0x47fc1: It's been a while but it's all coming back to me.
0x48022: How's that Sneaking Suit working out?
0x48052: I'm nice and dry, but it's a little hard to move.
0x48091: Bear with it. It's designed to prevent hypothermia.
0x480d2: This is Alaska, you know.
0x480f6: Take it easy, I'm grateful.
0x4811c: If it weren't for your suit and your shot, I would've turned into a popsicle out there.
0x48184: An anti-freezing peptide, Snake.
0x481af: All of the Genome Soldiers in this exercise are using it.
0x481f6: I see. I'm relieved to hear that. Already tested, huh?
0x4823a: By the way, how's the diversionary operation going?
0x4828f: Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.
0x482d9: The terrorist's radar should have already picked them up.
0x4833d: MEI LING
0x4835b: There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.
0x4839b: You've got to hurry!
0x483d9: Wow...,
0x483eb: he must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather.
0x4843a: Who's that?
0x4845a: Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.
0x4849d: This is Mei Ling. She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.
0x4850e: She designed your Codec as well as your Soliton radar system.
0x48559: Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.
0x485b6: Nice to meet you, Snake.
0x485d9: It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.
0x4861f: ..........
0x48634: What's wrong.
0x4864c: Nothing...
0x48661: I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...
0x486c0: ...cute.
0x486d3: You're just flattering me...
0x486fa: No, I'm serious.
0x48715: Well I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
0x48756: C'mon...
0x48769: I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...
0x487b4: But I'm surprised...
0x487d3: You're very frank for a trained killer.
0x48805: Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.
0x4884b: Yeah.
0x4885b: I'm looking forward to learning about the man behind the legend...
0x488b5: ...but first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system.
0x48928: Wow...,
0x4893a: he must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of weather.
0x48989: Who's that?
0x489a9: Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.
0x489ec: This is Mei Ling. She was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.
0x48a5d: She designed your Codec as well as your Soliton radar system.
0x48aa8: Contact her if you have any questions about either of them.
0x48b05: Nice to meet you, Snake.
0x48b28: It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.
0x48b6e: ..........
0x48b83: What's wrong.
0x48b9b: Nothing...
0x48bb0: I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...
0x48c0f: ...cute.
0x48c22: You're just flattering me...
0x48c49: No, I'm serious.
0x48c64: Well I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
0x48ca5: C'mon...
0x48cb8: I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...
0x48d03: But I'm surprised...
0x48d22: You're very frank for a trained killer.
0x48d54: Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other.
0x48d9a: Yeah.
0x48daa: I'm looking forward to learning about the man behind the legend...
0x48e51: Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it.
0x48ee8: Yes. It gets jammed easily I'm afraid.
0x48f2d: Yes. It's all made from currently existing technology.
0x48f71: You won't be able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance. So be careful.
0x48feb: We'll be monitoring your movements by radar,...
0x49028: ...so contact us by Codec anytime you want.
0x49061: Got it. I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.
0x490a8: Seriously, Snake.
0x490c4: We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice.
0x49130: I'm also in charge of your mission data.
0x49163: Contact me if you want me to record your current status.
0x491a9: My frequency is 140.96.
0x491cb: It's a dedicated frequency for saving data. Don't forget it.
0x4923d: Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.
0x4927d: You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find.
0x492c7: I remember. First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here,
0x4930f: ...and then all my weapons are taken away.
0x49347: Imagine yourself put in that position.
0x4938c: Well, if you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me.
0x493f0: I'll hold you to that, Doctor.
0x49419: By the way, sorry to disappoint you, but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.
0x49483: How did you do that?
0x494a2: In my stomach.
0x494bb: Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids.
0x4951d: Cigarettes? How are those going to help you?
0x49557: You never know.
0x4958d: We'll be monitoring your movements by radar,...
0x495ca: ...so contact us by Codec anytime you want.
0x49603: Got it. I'll call if I'm feeling lonely.
0x4964a: Seriously, Snake.
0x49666: We're here to back you up, so call if you need some information or advice.
0x496d2: I'm also in charge of your mission data.
0x49705: Contact me if you want me to record your current status.
0x4974b: My frequency is 140.96.
0x4976d: It's a dedicated frequency for saving data. Don't forget it.
0x497df: Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.
0x4981f: You need to arm yourself with whatever weapons you can find.
0x49869: I remember. First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here,
0x498b1: ...and then all my weapons are taken away.
0x498e9: Imagine yourself put in that position.
0x4992e: Well, if you make it back in one piece, maybe I'll let you do a strip search on me.
0x49992: I'll hold you to that, Doctor.
0x499bb: By the way, sorry to disappoint you, but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes.
0x49a25: How did you do that?
0x49a44: In my stomach.
0x49a5d: Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids.
0x49abf: Cigarettes? How are those going to help you?
0x49af9: You never know.
0x49b4b: Naomi, the Chief! What happened!?
0x49b77: I...I don't know.
0x49b93: It looked like a heart attack, but...
0x49beb: A heart attack? No...
0x49c0b: ...Colonel, are you hiding something from me?
0x49c46: Absolutely not. Snake, you've got to understand.
0x49c84: This op is security level Red.
0x49cad: You need the highest security clearance to get access to the complete file.
0x49d09: You want me to believe that you're in charge of this op, but you don't have complete access to the file!?
0x49d83: I told you. The Secretary of Defense is in operational control.
0x49dd0: I'm just here as your support...
0x49dfb: ..........
0x49e10: Snake, we don't have time to debate.
0x49e3f: Get out of there and find President Baker!
0x49ead: Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.
0x49ee8: Is it from the nanomachines?
0x49f0f: No, Snake.
0x49f24: The nanomachines are functioning properly.
0x49f5c: So what was it?
0x49f76: It must have been psychometric interference coming from Psycho Mantis, FOX-HOUND's psychic.
0x49fe2: Think of it is a mental feedback loop.
0x4a013: So that was Mantis...?
0x4a07f: Colonel! Are you listening?
0x4a0a5: Now he's dead too!
0x4a0c2: ...I have no idea!
0x4a0df: Don't lie to me!
0x4a10e: It looked like another heart attack, but...
0x4a147: Some kind of poison!?
0x4a167: Well, there are lots of drugs that can cause a heart attack in large doses.
0x4a1f2: But...
0x4a203: we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy.
0x4a243: Damn...!
0x4a26a: Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together!
0x4a2a5: Can I trust her!?
0x4a2c1: ...More than you can trust me.
0x4a2ea: ..........
0x4a2ff: Get in contact with her.
0x4a336: ...Snake, there's a lot of electrical interference coming from there.
0x4a389: It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us, but normal transmission is probably impossible.
0x4a401: Try moving away from that area.
0x4a43f: Snake, get a hold of yourself...
0x4a488: Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing!?
0x4a4c1: ..........
0x4a4d6: A member of FOX-HOUND?
0x4a4f7: No...
0x4a507: Are you sure?
0x4a51f: Yes, we have no one like that in our unit.
0x4a557: ...Is that right?
0x4a587: Snake, I'm counting on you.
0x4a5d9: Snake, I unlocked the cargo door for you.
0x4a610: Thanks. Where are you?
0x4a631: Where - I - can - see - ya.
0x4a661: Don't move around too much.
0x4a687: Don't worry, I'm disguised in this enemy uniform.
0x4a6dc: You won't be for long with the way you walk.
0x4a716: What does that mean?
0x4a741: Oh,...nothing.
0x4a75a: Listen Snake, the cargo door is like an airlock.
0x4a798: It's equipped with infrared sensors. Be careful.
0x4a7d6: If an intruder is sensed,  gas is released.
0x4a80f: Gas...
0x4a820: Okay, so we'll meet at the nuclear warhead storage building.
0x4a874: Wait! You said you'd stay put and be a good girl!
0x4a8b3: I changed my mind.
0x4a8d0: Don't get careless.  That's when things always turn sour.
0x4a917: Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure out whether or not I'm cut out to be a soldier.
0x4a984: ...I gotta get my hands dirty.
0x4a9ad: These guys are professionals.  You're gonna get yourself killed.
0x4a9fb: ...See ya there!
0x4aa42: Gray Fox...
0x4aa58: Colonel, that Ninja is Gray Fox.
0x4aa83: No doubt about it.
0x4aab4: Ridiculous.
0x4aaca: You of all people should know he died in Zanzibar...
0x4ab20: No. He should have died.
0x4ab43: ...but he didn't.
0x4ab87: What!?
0x4abac: It happened before I joined FOX- HOUND's medical staff.
0x4abf1: They were using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments.
0x4ac50: I never heard that.
0x4ac82: It happened right after you retired...
0x4acb3: My predecessor, Dr. Clark, was in charge.
0x4acfe: Dr. Clark?
0x4ad3b: Yes. He started the gene therapy project.
0x4ad72: And where is he now?
0x4ad9b: He was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago.
0x4ade0: So what about this soldier?
0x4ae06: Apparently for their test subject, they decided to use the body of a soldier
0x4ae60: who was recovered after the fall of Zanzibar...
0x4ae9d: And that was Gray Fox?
0x4aed2: But he was already dead!
0x4af1d: Yes. But they revived him.
0x4af42: They fitted him with a prototype exoskeleton and kept him drugged for four years...
0x4afa6: while they experimented on him like a plaything.
0x4afee: Today's genome soldiers were born from those experiments.
0x4b05d: That's the sickest thing I ever heard...
0x4b0a4: They used him to test all sorts of gene therapy techniques.
0x4b0ed: ...Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
0x4b138: ...Because it's confidential information.
0x4b16c: Is that the only reason?
0x4b18f: ..........
0x4b1c4: Naomi, what happened to Gray Fox after that?
0x4b212: The record says he died in the explosion.
0x4b25d: I see.
0x4b26e: But even if that ninja is Gray Fox, the question is why?
0x4b2b4: From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was.
0x4b2f4: Are you saying that he's just a mindless robot?
0x4b331: I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the death...
0x4b37f: ...we'll meet again, I know it.
0x4b3bd: So you'll fight again?
0x4b3e8: Until you kill him?
0x4b406: Hmmmm...
0x4b419: I'd rather not, but maybe that's what he wants...
0x4b458: ..........
0x4b499: Meryl, the engineer's okay.
0x4b4bf: That's a relief.
0x4b4e4: I want you to look after him.
0x4b50c: Where are you now?
0x4b529: Very close.
0x4b549: There she is! Over there!
0x4b56d: Oh no!
0x4b57e: Damn...they've spotted me!!
0x4b5c3: Meryl! What happened!
0x4b60f: Colonel, your niece is going to be okay.
0x4b64f: Thanks, Snake. I owe you one.
0x4b677: Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing should wear off, right Naomi?
0x4b6e9: Yes...
0x4b6fa: Why did you go so far out of your way to save her?
0x4b73a: For Campbell's sake?
0x4b759: ...or...
0x4b76c: ...maybe it's because you like her?
0x4b7a4: I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me.
0x4b7f3: Oh really? Since when did anybody's death bother you so much?
0x4b852: Naomi! It's true that Snake has killed a lot of people,...
0x4b89a: ...that doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart.
0x4b8d5: It's okay, Colonel...she's right.
0x4b929: ..........
0x4b9a3: Meryl!
0x4b9c8: Damn!! Snake, it's a trap!
0x4b9ed: Sniper's trick to lure you out.
0x4ba17: The sniper's waiting for you to go and help Meryl so he can pick you off...Don't do it!
0x4ba93: It must be Sniper Wolf...
0x4bab7: FOX-HOUND's best shooter.
0x4badb: Snipers usually work in pairs,  but this one's alone, huh?
0x4bb23: I know her.
0x4bb39: She can wait for hours, days or weeks. It doesn't matter to her.
0x4bb87: She's just watching and waiting for you to expose yourself.
0x4bbd0: Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long...
0x4bc0d: Snake, can you see Wolf from where you are?
0x4bc46: There's nowhere to hide between here and the tower...
0x4bc89: ...she must be on the 2nd floor of the tower.
0x4bcd8: If Wolf is in the Communications Tower, she can see you perfectly!  It's the classic sniper's position!!
0x4bd51: At that distance you won't be able to hit her with a standard weapon either!
0x4bdab: You'll need a sniper rifle!!
0x4bddc: Colonel! Take it easy.
0x4be07: ..........
0x4be1c: I'm going to save Meryl no matter what it takes.
0x4be64: Okay...thanks.
0x4be91: ..........
0x4bea6: What's wrong, Naomi?
0x4bec5: Nothing...
0x4bee4: ...I'm just surprised you're willing to sacrifice yourself...you've got the genes of a soldier, not a savior.
0x4bf62: Trying to say I'm only interested in saving my own skin?
0x4bfa8: I wouldn't go that far, but...
0x4bfd1: I don't know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care.
0x4c01e: I operate on instinct.
0x4c03f: Like an animal?
0x4c059: I'm going to save Meryl.  I don't need an excuse.
0x4c098: Okay...
0x4c0aa: And I'm not doing it for someone else either.
0x4c0e5: I'm going to save Meryl for myself.
0x4c113: Colonel, don't worry!
0x4c147: Snake, thanks.
0x4c174: I understand.
0x4c18c: I'm sorry.
0x4c1ec: Snake, are you okay?
0x4c20b: I've been better...
0x4c23d: How's Meryl?
0x4c273: ...They've got her.
0x4c2a5: Damn...!
0x4c2e8: ..........
0x4c327: ..........
0x4c34a: Snake,...
0x4c35e: ...the government has decided not to give in to their demands.
0x4c3aa: We're trying to buy some more time.
0x4c3d8: C'mon Colonel,...
0x4c3f4: ...why don't you stop playing dumb?
0x4c422: I'm sorry about Meryl. But I want the lies to end now.
0x4c466: What are you talking about?
0x4c48c: Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead, wasn't it?
0x4c4fe: You knew it all along, didn't you?
0x4c535: ..........
0x4c556: Why did you try to hide it?
0x4c57c: ...I'm sorry...
0x4c596: Can't tell the grunts, huh...
0x4c5be: ...You've changed a lot.
0x4c5e1: Metal Gear...secret advanced nuclear weapons research...
0x4c627: Does the White House know about this? How deep does it go?
0x4c679: ...As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not been briefed about the Rex Project.
0x4c6ea: "Need to know basis", is that the idea?
0x4c720: These are sensitive times. Even sub- critical nuclear tests are causing quite a stir.
0x4c786: Plausible deniability, huh?
0x4c7ac: Yes.
0x4c7bb: And tomorrow, the President and his Russian counterpart are scheduled to sign the Start 3 Accord.
0x4c82d: I get it. That's the reason for the deadline.
0x4c87c: That's right, Snake.
0x4c89b: And that's why we can't let this terrorist attack go public.
0x4c8f9: We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.
0x4c94e: This has to do with the President's reputation and America's place as the dominant superpower.
0x4c9bd: So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?
0x4ca0b: Please Snake, just stop them...
0x4ca35: Why should I?
0x4ca4d: Because you're the only one who can.
0x4ca7c: In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead.
0x4cad1: I told you before.  I don't know the details.
0x4cb0c: I don't believe you.
0x4cb35: ..........
0x4cb4a: If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands?
0x4cb9f: Let them have Big Boss's remains.
0x4cbd5: You see...
0x4cbea: Or is there some reason that you can't do that?
0x4cc31: Something you haven't told me about...
0x4cc76: Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to eugenics experiments.
0x4ccdd: We don't want the existence of the genome army to go public.
0x4cd27: And that's the only reason?
0x4cd61: ..........
0x4cd82: Huh! The hell with you!
0x4cda4: I'm sorry...
0x4cdbb: The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me.
0x4ce1a: Poor man.
0x4ce38: But it's strange. He looks and smells like he's been dead for days.
0x4ce89: All his blood's been drained out too.
0x4cee1: Drained!?
0x4cf09: Maybe to slow down decomposition?
0x4cf3f: I have no idea.
0x4cf59: But the Chief only died a few hours ago, right?
0x4cf96: Right.
0x4cfa7: But he's already started to decompose.
0x4cfdb: What could it all be about?
0x4d00b: Something in his blood that they wanted?
0x4d041: I doubt it. Just the nanomachines and the transmitter.
0x4d099: Did the Chief tell them his detonation code?
0x4d0d3: I'm afraid so. It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch.
0x4d137: Damn. Is there any way to prevent it?
0x4d167: It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.
0x4d1db: It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.
0x4d220: You have to unlock it with three special card keys.
0x4d261: And where are those keys?
0x4d285: I've got one of them. I don't know where the other two are.
0x4d2ce: Besides, I'm locked up here.
0x4d2f5: We've got no choice.  Forget about the keys.
0x4d32f: Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.
0x4d373: I'm sorry to have to lay it all in your lap, but you're all I've got.
0x4d3c6: Bust out of there and get to the Communications Tower.
0x4d439: Also...
0x4d455: What?
0x4d465: I know it's asking a lot...
0x4d48b: Meryl, right?
0x4d4a3: Yeah...
0x4d4b5: I'll save her.
0x4d4ce: Thanks.
0x4d540: ..........
0x4d55f: ..........
0x4d591: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x4d5bf: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x4d5f8: What can I say?
0x4d612: Anything.
0x4d62c: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x4d65a: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x4d693: What can I say?
0x4d6ad: Anything.
0x4d6c3: I...I'm not a very good talker...
0x4d6ef: Please...
0x4d703: ...tell me about yourself.
0x4d732: Myself?
0x4d744: ...That's a tough one.
0x4d765: Any family?
0x4d785: ...That's not a happy topic for me.
0x4d7bd: I don't have any family...
0x4d7e2: No wait, there was a man who said he was my father...
0x4d825: Where is he?
0x4d83c: Dead.
0x4d860: ...by my own hand.
0x4d891: Big Boss.
0x4d8b9: What!? Big Boss!!? I had no idea.
0x4d8fc: There was no way you could.
0x4d922: It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago.
0x4d951: Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.
0x4d9af: So...is it true?
0x4d9ca: Was Big Boss really your father?
0x4d9f5: That's what he said...
0x4da16: That's all I know.
0x4da33: And you were able to kill him, knowing that?
0x4da6d: Yup.
0x4da86: How?
0x4da95: He wanted it.
0x4dab7: Besides, some people just need killing...
0x4db02: That's patricide...!
0x4db2b: Yup.
0x4db3a: That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.
0x4db78: The one we share in common.
0x4dba1: Is that why you left FOX-HOUND?
0x4dbcb: Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska was the perfect place...
0x4dc34: ...Snake.
0x4dc5e: ...I didn't have a real family either.
0x4dc8f: Just a big brother who put me through school.
0x4dcca: We weren't even blood-related and he was much older than me.
0x4dd14: Where is he?
0x4dd35: ...He's dead...
0x4dd4f: I'm sorry...
0x4dd70: Snake...
0x4dd83: ...is there a woman in your life?
0x4ddaf: After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.
0x4de05: Friends?
0x4de18: ...Roy Campbell...
0x4de53: Huh? You're still calling me friend?
0x4de96: Is that it?
0x4deac: No, there was another...
0x4decf: Frank Jaeger.
0x4def1: What!?
0x4df16: Big Boss's most trusted lieutenant
0x4df43: and the only member of FOX-HOUND ever to receive the codename "Fox."
0x4df97: ...Gray Fox.
0x4dfc2: ..........
0x4dfed: I learned a lot from him...
0x4e013: But...
0x4e024: ...didn't you try to kill each other?
0x4e054: It's true. We did. In Zanzibar.
0x4e07e: But it was nothing personal.
0x4e0a5: ...we were just professionals on opposite sides, that's all.
0x4e0ef: And you still call yourself "friends"!?
0x4e123: Hard to believe?
0x4e13e: War is no reason to end a friendship.
0x4e16e: That's insane.
0x4e187: I first met him on the battlefield.
0x4e1b5: He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.
0x4e1f0: But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.
0x4e231: He was always so cool and precise. I was still green and he showed me the ropes.
0x4e292: You knew him well?
0x4e2af: No. We never talked about our personal lives.
0x4e2ea: Sort of an unwritten rule...
0x4e311: The next time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.
0x4e35b: We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.
0x4e394: I know it sounds strange to most people.
0x4e3ca: But we were just two soldiers doing our jobs.
0x4e40f: It's like a sport.
0x4e42c: Men and their games!
0x4e44b: You're like wild animals!
0x4e46f: You're right. We are animals.
0x4e497: So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?
0x4e4ea: I don't know.
0x4e502: It's your genes...they make you predisposed towards violence!
0x4e54d: You really like talking about genes, Naomi.
0x4e586: Why did you get into genetic research anyway?
0x4e5d7: ...I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like.
0x4e627: I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am.
0x4e688: So you studied about DNA?
0x4e6ac: Yeah. I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.
0x4e70b: I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information,
0x4e754: I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory.
0x4e79b: Memory is stored in DNA?
0x4e7be: We're not sure.
0x4e7d8: But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA.
0x4e861: So what about my fate?
0x4e882: You know my DNA sequence, don't you?
0x4e8c8: Your fate?
0x4e8dd: I...
0x4e8ec: ...I'm sorry. I have no idea.
0x4e914: Of course not.
0x4e92d: You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
0x4e961: ..........
0x4e9cf: You okay, Snake?
0x4ea09: Yeah...nothing new to report.
0x4ea45: Snake, is there anything I can do?
0x4ea7e: Yeah, my arm hurts...
0x4ea9e: ...Poor Snake.
0x4eab7: I'll increase the level of pain killers in your blood.
0x4eafb: Okay, but you can leave out the benzedrine.
0x4eb34: That stuff makes me too frisky.
0x4eb5e: I guess you're not feeling too bad after all.
0x4ebc7: Snake, put the controller up against your arm.
0x4ec03: What?
0x4ec13: Don't worry. It'll feel good.
0x4ec3b: Huh?
0x4ec4a: Okay, here I go.
0x4ec82: Ooooh.
0x4ec9d: How does that feel, Snake?
0x4ecc2: A little better?
0x4ecdd: How did you do that?
0x4ecfc: I stimulated your muscle fibers with the nanomachine's cilia.
0x4ed47: That's about all I can do for you...
0x4ed94: ..........
0x4eda9: I'm not the right guy.  I can't save the world.
0x4edfa: What's wrong?
0x4ee12: I gave in to the pain...
0x4ee53: I'm sorry, Colonel.
0x4ee8f: I sacrificed Meryl to save myself...
0x4eed2: ...Snake..........
0x4eef9: She was a soldier. She knew the risks.
0x4ef2a: Battlefield casualties are always tragic, but they're an unavoidable  part of war.
0x4efa1: Don't blame yourself.
0x4efc1: You still have a mission to do.
0x4efeb: ..........
0x4f06a: ..........
0x4f089: ..........
0x4f0bb: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x4f0e9: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x4f122: What can I say?
0x4f13c: Anything.
0x4f156: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x4f184: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x4f1bd: What can I say?
0x4f1d7: Anything.
0x4f1ed: I...I'm not a very good talker...
0x4f219: Please...
0x4f22d: ...tell me about yourself.

0x5043e: Of course not.
0x50457: You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
0x5048b: ..........
0x5050b: That was a close one, Snake.
0x50532: Ocelot...you'll pay for that...
0x50581: That Deepthroat's a real enigma.  He's definitely from inside their ranks.
0x505d9: Is he an informer?
0x505f6: Maybe some kind of renegade?
0x5061d: I've got the feeling there's some other force at work here.
0x50694: Snake, about Meryl...
0x506b4: Colonel, I'm sorry...
0x506d4: Listen to me.
0x506ec: I wasn't able to protect her.
0x50757: Snake, it's okay.
0x50773: You did what you could, now let it rest.
0x507a6: Colonel...
0x507d9: Snake...she's a soldier.
0x507fc: She knows that prisoners are  a part of war.
0x50844: She joined up of her own free will.
0x50872: I'm sure she was prepared for this.
0x508a0: No. You're wrong...
0x508c8: .....?
0x508d9: Meryl thought she had to become a soldier...thought it was the only way.
0x50932: She said she thought it would bring her closer to her dead father.
0x5098c: She said that!?
0x509a6: She wasn't ready for real combat.
0x509d2: I shouldn't have pushed her so hard. ...It's all my fault.
0x50a2e: That's not like you, Snake.
0x50a7c: Master? What is it?
0x50aae: Sorry for eavesdropping,  but I just couldn't listen anymore.
0x50af9: Master...
0x50b0d: Snake, you can have regrets if you want to...it's only natural.
0x50b5a: But you can't keep attacking yourself for things that happened in the past.
0x50bb3: That road leads to madness,  believe me.
0x50bfd: He's right. Don't kick yourself.
0x50c28: It doesn't suit a legend like you.
0x50c70: And besides that, for all we know Meryl's okay, right?
0x50cc6: I'm sure Meryl's just fine.
0x50cfa: Mei Ling...
0x50d24: Snake, forget about Meryl. Stop Liquid.
0x50d59: That's what Meryl would want, too.
0x50d86: You're right.
0x50d9e: Meryl would say the same thing.
0x50df0: ...Snake?
0x50e04: What?
0x50e14: Meryl...she's pretty special to you, huh?
0x50e4b: Yes, she's special.
0x50e69: There aren't many women like her around.
0x50e9f: ...That's not what I meant...
0x50ec7: She's the Colonel's niece. ...and a combat buddy.
0x50f10: Is that all? C'mon...
0x50f3a: ...This is like a police interrogation.
0x50f6c: No...I just...
0x50f99: I guess it's in the genes...
0x50fc0: The genes?
0x50fd5: What are you talking about, Colonel?
0x51004: No, I just remembered about Naomi's grandfather.
0x51042: I think Naomi said he rose as high as assistant secretary in the FBI during Edgar Hoover's time.
0x510b3: Is that right?
0x510ea: Yes...yes, he was Japanese and he became a special undercover investigator to nab the mafia.
0x5116b: When was that?
0x51198: Oh...sometime in the 50's, I guess.
0x511da: Where?
0x511ff: ...New York, I think...
0x5123f: Naomi...I thought that you didn't have any family...
0x51295: Well...I...I researched it after I became an adult.
0x512d6: My grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.
0x51324: I never even had the chance to meet him...
0x51370: Oh...
0x51394: ...Snake, good luck.
0x513c7: Watch your back, Snake.
0x51464: 7 OTACON
0x51494: Snake, the elevator's working.
0x514bd: You fixed it?
0x514d5: No, that's the weird thing.
0x514fb: It just moved by itself.  It's headed your way now.
0x5153c: Is that so? Okay.
0x51558: That explosion before...what was it?
0x51587: Oh, I had to take out that helicopter.
0x515b8: Helicopter? That's incredible, Snake!
0x515eb: Listen. I just want to make sure again.
0x51627: This is the way to get to where Metal Gear is being stored?
0x51670: Yeah. The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards the back of the snowfield ahead.
0x516e6: Okay. Find a safe place to hide out for a while.
0x51727: I'm going underground.
0x51748: I know, I know. You don't have to tell me.
0x51780: And stay outta my way.  Don't try to be a hero or anything.
0x517c9: Okay, call me if you need to.
0x5182d: Snake, there's something I forgot to tell you before.
0x51870: What?
0x51880: There were five stealth camouflage prototypes in my lab.
0x518c6: Yeah, so?
0x518da: If you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four.
0x5191e: Hey. This isn't first grade math class.
0x51950: I thought I'd get one for you,  so I went back to the lab and...
0x5199e: Yeah?
0x519b8: The four suits were missing.
0x519df: .........?
0x519f4: Also...about the elevator that I checked out...
0x51a31: It's really strange.
0x51a50: It was like someone was intentionally holding it.
0x51a8f: When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off?
0x51add: That's another thing that bothered me about it...
0x51b1c: The warning went off and I know I couldn't be over the limit.
0x51b67: How much do you weigh?
0x51b88: About 135.
0x51b9d: But that elevator had a weight limit of 650 pounds.
0x51bde: It would take at least five people to go over that limit...
0x51c27: L...Look out, Snake!
0x51c46: The guys who stole my stealth prototypes are in there with you!!!
0x51d0f: Snake!! Are you okay!?
0x51d30: Otacon! Were there any other stealth prototypes?
0x51d71: No. There were only five.
0x51d95: So...this isn't stealth camouflage then...
0x51dca: What are you talking about?
0x51df0: Someone's aiming at me...
0x51e14: ...in the middle of this blizzard...
0x51e46: ...It's her!!
0x51e5e: Wolf?
0x51e6e: ...Sniper Wolf?
0x51e88: Yes it's her!
0x51ea0: ...It's definitely her!
0x51ec2: Otacon... You sound like you're happy.
0x51ef6: No I'm not.
0x51f0c: So then what is it?
0x51f34: Snake...
0x51f47: ...please don't kill her!
0x51f6b: Are you insane!?
0x51f86: Please. She's a good person!
0x51fad: You'd know that if you talked to her...
0x51fdf: Listen to me, kid. She's a merciless killer.
0x52037: I can see you perfectly from here.
0x520dc: I told you...
0x520f4: I'd never quit the hunt.  Now you're mine.
0x52140: Wolf! No, you can't!
0x52173: Don't get between a wolf and its prey!
0x521a4: You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm.
0x521e5: You see?
0x52202: Women naturally make better soldiers.
0x52246: Wolf! Don't do this!!
0x5227a: Snake, I'm near.
0x52295: Can't you sense me near you?
0x522bc: It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location.
0x52307: Is that right?
0x5232a: Well I'm going to send you a love letter, my dear.
0x5236a: Do you know what that is? It's a bullet straight from my gun to your heart.
0x523d7: Please!! Wolf!...Snake!...No!
0x52413: Quiet!
0x52424: Don't get in our way!
0x52444: Now I'm gonna pay you back for Meryl...
0x52479: You men are so weak.
0x52498: You can never finish what you start...
0x5252a: Snake.
0x52547: I've got something to tell you about Naomi Hunter.
0x52587: What about her?
0x525a1: Is this conversation secure?
0x525c8: Don't worry.
0x525df: The monitor's off.
0x525fc: Okay.
0x5260c: What's up?
0x52621: I was in the FBI too, y'know.
0x52649: I didn't know that. What's your point?
0x5267a: Dr. Hunter's story about her background...
0x526b2: ...about her grandfather being an assistant secretary to Hoover in the FBI...
0x52710: Yeah?
0x52720: And then going undercover to investigate the mafia in New York..
0x5276e: Yeah, what about it?
0x5278d: It was all a big lie.
0x527b7: What did you say?
0x527d3: It was really bothering me.
0x527f9: Why would she lie about it?
0x5281f: She lied?
0x52833: She might be a spy!
0x52851: Ridiculous.
0x52867: C'mon. Even a high school student could see past it.
0x528a9: The head of the FBI at that time, Edgar Hoover...he was a well-known racist.
0x52906: Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese?
0x52942: Yeah...
0x52954: Well back then there wasn't a single Asian investigator.
0x5299a: Also, in the 1950's the undercover mafia sting operations hadn't even started yet.
0x529fd: They first started in 1960...in Chicago, not New York.
0x52a41: But...
0x52a52: You better check it out.
0x52a75: The chief and the president mysteriously dying, that ninja...too many strange things are happening.
0x52ae9: Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?
0x52b24: I don't know.
0x52b3c: Either that or she's working with the terrorists.
0x52b7b: ...Could it be?
0x52b95: If I find out anything, I'll call.
0x52bc2: In the meantime, be careful!
0x52c15: Snake, it's me...
0x52c31: Master?
0x52c43: It's about Naomi.
0x52c5f: Turn your monitor off...
0x52c96: What about Naomi?
0x52cda: Damn!
0x52cea: Colonel, is Naomi there?
0x52d21: No she's away.
0x52d3a: She's taking a short nap.
0x52d5e: Hmmm...
0x52d70: So what is this about Naomi?
0x52dab: Okay.
0x52dbb: Maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this too.
0x52df9: Yeah...go on Master.
0x52e18: Well basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at all.
0x52e8e: What!?
0x52eb3: I thought her story of her background sounded kind of fishy, so I checked it out.
0x52f29: And...?
0x52f4f: There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter, or I should say there was one...
0x52fa2: But she's not the woman we know.
0x52fd7: The real Naomi Hunter disappeared somewhere in the Middle East.
0x53024: Our Naomi must have somehow obtained her identification papers.
0x53085: So then who is she really?
0x530be: She must be some kind of...spy.
0x53110: A spy!?
0x53136: Yes...maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation.
0x53199: Are you saying she's with the terrorists?
0x531d0: ...I don't want to believe it either.
0x53200: But she is working for FOX-HOUND...
0x5322e: So you think she had a part in the uprising?
0x5327c: Or she could be working with some different group altogether.
0x532e7: Different group...?
0x53305: It couldn't be...
0x5333f: Place her under arrest.
0x53389: What!
0x533ad: She's betrayed us.
0x533ca: She needs to be arrested and interrogated to find out who she's with.
0x53445: If she's one of their spies,  then we're in big trouble...
0x53497: What do you mean!?
0x534be: Oh nothing...
0x534ea: Have you let her in on some kind of vital secret or something?
0x5355e: ..........
0x53587: Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths of the DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president?
0x53627: I...I have no idea.
0x53663: Anyway, we cannot allow her to participate any further in this mission.
0x536e0: Wait, wait a minute.
0x536ff: Without her, we can't complete this mission.
0x53739: I knew it. You're hiding something.
0x53767: Give me some time.
0x53784: I'll try to get it out of her...
0x537c3: Hurry then.
0x537d9: We've got to figure out who she is and what she's doing here.
0x53838: I understand.
0x53850: Snake, give me some time.
0x53874: I don't have any time left for you.
0x5391d: 7 OTACON
0x5394d: Snake...it's me.
0x53968: What's wrong?
0x53980: Did you find a good place to hide?
0x539ad: Yeah, thanks to the stealth gear.
0x539e5: It looks like they've finished getting Metal Gear ready.
0x53a2b: How do you know that?
0x53a4b: I overheard them talking.
0x53a6f: Where are you now?
0x53a8c: Right in front of Metal Gear. ...but it's strange.
0x53acc: What is?
0x53adf: There's nobody here...
0x53b00: ...no guards, nobody patrolling...
0x53b2d: ...it's too quiet.
0x53b4a: Maybe because they're all ready.
0x53b75: They said they even input the PAL codes.
0x53bab: What should I do?
0x53bc7: All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told you about.
0x53c25: But I've only got one of the three keys.
0x53c58: And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys...
0x53cb1: Leave it to me...
0x53ccd: You got some kind of plan?
0x53cf2: Well, I'm in the computer room right now.
0x53d29: I'm trying to access Baker's private files.
0x53d62: Baker's files?
0x53d7b: Don't you need a password?
0x53da0: Of course. But there are ways...
0x53dd5: Are you a hacker?
0x53dfb: Yup. That describes me pretty well.
0x53e2c: Does it look like you can get in?
0x53e58: I don't know yet.
0x53e74: I'll give it a try.
0x53e92: I'm counting on you...
0x53f3e: 7 OTACON
0x53f6e: Snake...it's me again.
0x53f9b: How's it going?
0x53fb5: Hmmm...not bad.
0x53fcf: I just got past his 3rd security level.
0x54001: He was a pretty careful guy.
0x54028: Do you think you'll break in soon?
0x54055: I've never met a system I couldn't bust into.
0x54090: Okay, keep trying...
0x54116: 7 OTACON
0x5415a: Snake, I did it!
0x5417f: You got past security?
0x541a0: Bingo!!!
0x541b3: Great! So whaddya got?
0x541d4: I accessed the confidential Metal Gear file.
0x5420e: So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about?
0x5425a: I haven't found it yet...
0x5427e: That's what I need to know!
0x542a4: But Snake, I found something else!
0x542d1: What?
0x542eb: The secret behind the new nuclear weapon!
0x5432c: Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun like a projectile...
0x543a2: It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't considered a missile.
0x543e6: That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties.
0x54433: Pretty sneaky.
0x5444c: Yes, but effective.
0x5446a: And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon.
0x544b1: I can't wait to hear this.
0x544d6: It's a stealth weapon!
0x54501: You mean it won't show up on radar?
0x5452f: Yeah.
0x5453f: The truth is...they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's.
0x5459a: Why weren't they able to develop one up until now?
0x545da: Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system...it will be picked up by enemy satellites.
0x54648: Oh yeah, that makes sense.
0x5466d: But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellent.
0x546ba: So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems.
0x54713: An invisible nuclear warhead...
0x5473d: Totally impossible to intercept.
0x54768: And on top of that it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases.
0x547e4: We learned that lesson in the Gulf War.
0x54819: This thing could mean the end of the world!
0x54852: It's the ultimate weapon.
0x54876: And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.
0x548ee: Colonel, is this true? Are you listening?
0x5494f: I'm listening...
0x5496a: If word of this got out,
0x5498d: it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident.
0x54a0b: Yeah, it would be nasty.
0x54a2e: The United States would be denounced by the U.N...it could even bring the President down...
0x54a9a: Did you know this, Colonel!?
0x54adf: I'm sorry...
0x54af6: You've changed, Colonel...
0x54b1b: I won't make any excuses...
0x54b55: Snake, listen to me.
0x54b74: This new nuclear weapon...it's never actually been tested, only simulated.
0x54bcc: You mean they ran a computer model?
0x54bfa: Yeah, that's why they were conducting this exercise.
0x54c3c: They needed to get actual experimental data to back up the simulation.
0x54c93: What were the results of the exercise?
0x54cc4: It looks like it went better than they hoped for. But...
0x54d0a: I can't find the data anywhere on this network.
0x54d47: You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded...
0x54d9e: It was. President Baker gave me an optical disk with all of the test data.
0x54e1e: What!? Do you still have it?
0x54e45: No. Ocelot took it from me.
0x54e75: Damn...
0x54e9b: The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead.
0x54eec: Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch.
0x54f3f: So you think they can do it?
0x54f66: Well, the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so.
0x54fcd: Did you find out how to override it yet?
0x55000: Not yet. It must be in a separate file.
0x55035: Right now I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files.
0x5507f: We're counting on you...
0x5511d: 7 OTACON
0x5514d: Snake?
0x5515e: Did you find it?
0x55179: No, I haven't found out about the override system yet, but I found Baker's ulterior motive.
0x551e5: He's just looking to get rich, isn't he?
0x55218: That's part of it. ArmsTech is in much worse financial trouble than I thought.
0x55274: I know they lost their bid to make the next generation fighter jet. That plus the reduction in SDI spending...
0x552f3: It looks like there was even some talk of a hostile takeover.
0x5533e: Everything was riding on this project, I guess.
0x5537b: And it looks like we were paying a lot of bribe money to the DARPA Chief.
0x553d2: Bribe money, huh.
0x553ee: Yeah, and Baker was a big proponent of the nuclear deterrent theory.
0x55440: I see... So anyway, what about the override?
0x5547a: Just give me a little bit longer...
0x55533: 7 OTACON
0x5556d: Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files!
0x555a3: Great job.
0x555b8: How's it going there?
0x555d8: They've finished inputting the PAL codes.
0x5560f: So how do we deactivate them?
0x55637: Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking about...
0x5568d: It can also be used to input the detonation codes.
0x556cd: Y'see, if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it.
0x55727: And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated.
0x55775: And you can only use the keys once.
0x557a3: Only once, huh.
0x557bd: Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time.
0x55804: But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them!
0x5584d: Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick.
0x55884: You already have all three keys!
0x558af: What are you talking about!?
0x558d6: The card key is made of a shape memory alloy.
0x55911: Shape memory alloy?
0x5592f: Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures.
0x5597f: The key is made out of it!
0x559a4: This card key?
0x559bd: Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures.
0x55a13: So this key is actually three keys in one...clever.
0x55a80: Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter...
0x55aac: Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it.
0x55af4: Turn your monitor off.
0x55b15: Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead.
0x55b54: Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear.
0x55b8f: Okay, so what's up?
0x55bad: I've got a good friend in the Pentagon...
0x55be4: Yeah...
0x55bf6: He's the one who told me about it...
0x55c25: It looks like the DIA recently developed a new type of assassination weapon.
0x55c82: An assassination weapon?
0x55ca5: Snake, have you ever heard of something called "FoxDie"?
0x55ced: No...
0x55d07: FoxDie?
0x55d19: ...Liquid and the others were talking about it...
0x55d58: Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people.
0x55da1: I don't know all the details, but...
0x55dd0: What are you trying to say?
0x55df6: It's too similar.
0x55e12: What is!?
0x55e26: The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,...
0x55e96: ...die of something that looked like a heart attack?
0x55ed8: Yeah...?
0x55eeb: Well, apparently FoxDie kills its victims by simulating a heart attack.
0x55f40: ..........
0x55f55: ...No...You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?
0x55f96: Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?
0x55fe6: ...The nanomachines.
0x56005: She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was.
0x56069: ...Does the Colonel know?
0x5608d: I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her.
0x560cc: Okay. I'll ask him myself.
0x560fd: Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?
0x56160: I just placed Naomi under arrest.
0x56196: Arrest?
0x561a8: She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base.
0x561ee: I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists.
0x56245: Are you sure?
0x5625d: I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now.
0x56297: What kind of interrogation?
0x562bd: Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any sodium pentathol here.
0x56329: Call me if you find out anything.
0x56369: So it's true, isn't it?
0x5638b: Naomi...I can't believe it.
0x563b1: That means the FoxDie vaccine must be around somewhere.
0x563f6: Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about.
0x56432: But Snake...you might be infected too, you know.
0x56470: All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel.
0x564df: Snake, can you hear me?
0x56501: It's Naomi...
0x56523: Naomi!?
0x56535: ...what the hell!?
0x56552: Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different Codec.
0x565a6: Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?
0x565d6: ...Yes.
0x565e8: But not everything I said was a lie.
0x56617: Who are you?
0x56638: I don't know myself.
0x56657: I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.
0x566ad: I bought all my identification.
0x566d7: But my reason for getting into genetics was true.
0x56716: Cause you want to know yourself, right?
0x5674b: That's right. I want to know where I came from...m, my age, my race... ...anything.
0x567af: Naomi...
0x567c2: I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's...
0x56809: ...a dirty little orphan...
0x56843: Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe?
0x56878: Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.
0x56903: That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that...
0x56967: Naomi, you're too worried about the past.
0x5699e: Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?
0x569e4: Understand who I am now!?
0x56a08: Why should I? No one else tries to understand me.
0x56a47: I was alone for so long...
0x56a76: ...until I met my big brother and "him."
0x56aab: Your big brother?
0x56ac7: Yes.
0x56ad6: Frank Jaeger.
0x56b04: What!?
0x56b15: He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi River.
0x56b67: I was half-dead from starvation and  he shared his rations with me.
0x56bc2: Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my only family.
0x56c23: No...
0x56c33: Gray Fox?
0x56c47: We survived that hell together, Frank and I.
0x56c81: He protected me.
0x56c9c: He's my one connection...
0x56cc0: ...the only connection that I have to my past.
0x56cfc: And he brought you back to America?
0x56d2a: No.
0x56d38: I was in Mozambique when "he" came.
0x56d68: Who is "he"?
0x56d81: ...You mean Big Boss?
0x56da1: Yes.
0x56db0: He brought us to this "land of freedom",  this America.
0x56df7: But then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.
0x56e52: And that's when it happened...
0x56e85: You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.
0x56ecf: I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.
0x56f02: I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I would...
0x56f64: So were your prayers answered?
0x56fa3: Yes. I waited two long years...
0x56fd7: To kill me?
0x56fed: Is that all you cared about?
0x57014: Yes. That's right.
0x5704f: Two years.
0x57064: You were all I thought about for two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession...
0x570cd: Do you still hate me?
0x570f7: ...Not exactly.
0x57111: I was partly wrong about you...
0x5713b: What about Liquid and the others?
0x57171: No. I'll have my revenge on them too.
0x571a4: Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?
0x571e3: The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments...
0x57233: Dr. Clark?
0x57248: ...No...that was my brother.
0x5726f: Afterwards I covered it up and helped him hide out...
0x572be: So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox...
0x572eb: ...he's come here to kill me?
0x57313: ...I don't think so.
0x57332: I think he just came here to fight you...
0x57366: I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.
0x573a7: A final battle with you...
0x573d6: ...that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it...
0x5740e: ...Fox...no...
0x57445: Naomi, tell me something...
0x5746b: ...about FoxDie?
0x5749c: FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.
0x574f5: First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.
0x5753a: FoxDie contains "smart" enzymes, created through protein engineering.
0x5758f: They're programmed to respond to specific genetic patterns in the cells.
0x575e5: Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?
0x5761c: Right. They respond by becoming  active, and using the macrophages, they begin creating TNF epsilon.
0x57691: Huh?
0x576a0: It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.
0x576eb: The TNF epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells.
0x57778: And then...they cause a heart attack?
0x577a8: The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis. Then...
0x57815: ...the victim dies.
0x57833: Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide...
0x57883: ...Naomi...
0x57899: ...What?
0x578ac: ...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right?
0x57915: ..........
0x5792a: Do I still have time?
0x5794a: ..........
0x5795f: Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.
0x5799a: But I can't go yet.  I still have a job to do.
0x579d6: Listen, Snake.
0x579ef: ...I'm not the one who made the decision to use FoxDie.
0x57a34: Huh?
0x57a43: You weren't?
0x57a82: No.
0x57a90: You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation.
0x57ad8: I just wanted to let you know that...
0x57b12: ...No, that's not the whole truth...
0x57b41: Huh?
0x57b50: The real thing that I wanted to tell you was...
0x57b8d: Snake, I...I...
0x57bbb: Hey! What are you doing!?
0x57bdf: Eeeek!!
0x57bf1: Ooooh....
0x57c05: Snake.....
0x57c1a: Naomi!?
0x57c2c: ...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.
0x57c84: What!
0x57c94: Naomi's been removed from this operation.
0x57ccb: What happened to Naomi!?
0x57cee: What did she mean when she said that FoxDie was a part of this operation!?
0x57d49: Colonel, let me talk to her!
0x57d70: I won't. She's under arrest.
0x57d97: Colonel...
0x57dac: ...you double crossed me!
0x57dd0: Snake, there's no time for that!
0x57dfb: Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear!
0x57e32: ...Okay, Snake!?
0x57ea2: Thank you, Snake.
0x57ebe: Now the detonation code is completed.
0x57ef1: Nothing can stop Metal Gear now.
0x57f1c: Master, what's going on?
0x57f3f: You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I really must express my gratitude.
0x57fba: Sorry to have involved you in that silly shape memory alloy business.
0x5800d: What are you talking about?
0x58033: We weren't able to learn the DARPA Chief's code.
0x58071: Even with Mantis' psychic powers,  he couldn't read his mind.
0x580bc: Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during the interrogation.
0x58107: In other words, we weren't able to  launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.
0x5817f: Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met.
0x581d4: What do you mean?
0x581f0: Without the detonation codes,  we had to find some other way.
0x5823b: That's when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.
0x58280: What?
0x58290: First I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.
0x582db: So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.
0x5832e: Unfortunately Octopus didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie.
0x58390: You mean you had this planned from the beginning?
0x583cf: Just to get me to input the detonation code!?
0x5840a: Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?
0x58458: Who the hell are you!?
0x58479: In any case, the launch preparations are complete.
0x584b9: Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon,
0x584f8: the White House will have no choice but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine to me.
0x58557: Their ace-in-the-hole is useless now...
0x58589: Ace-in-the-hole?
0x585a4: The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful...
0x585ea: ...in the torture room.
0x58606: l"j!
0x5861a: l"j!
0x5862e: l"j!
0x58642: l"j!
0x58656: l"j!
0x5866a: l"j!
0x5867e: l"j!
0x5868e: Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.
0x586c8: Poor fool.
0x586dd: Who are you anyway!?
0x586fc: I'll tell you everything you want to know.
0x58734: If you come to where I am, that is.
0x58762: Where are you?
0x5877b: Very close by.
0x587a8: Snake, that's not Master Miller!
0x587e7: Campbell, you're too late.
0x58820: Master Miller's body was just discovered at his home.
0x58863: He's been dead for at least three days.
0x58898: I didn't know because my Codec link with Master was cut off.
0x588e2: But Mei Ling said his transmission signal was coming from inside the base!
0x5893d: So who is it?
0x58955: Snake, you've been talking to...
0x58994: ...Me...
0x589a7: ...dear brother.
0x589cc: Liquid!? How the...!?
0x589ec: You've served your purpose.
0x58a12: You may die now!
0x58a78: Colonel! Can you hear me?
0x58a9c: Yes...I'm listening.
0x58abb: What is the Pentagon trying to do!?
0x58ae9: Colonel! Answer me!
0x58b07: The Secretary of Defense has taken over active control of this operation.
0x58b5e: He's on his way there by AWACS.
0x58b88: What for?
0x58b9c: To bomb the place.
0x58bb9: What!?
0x58bca: Not only that.
0x58be3: B-2 Bombers just lifted off from Galena Airforce Base.
0x58c27: They're carrying B61-13 surface- piercing tactical nuclear bombs.
0x58c76: What!? Metal Gear is destroyed. Tell the Secretary of Defense!
0x58cc2: The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us and he's worried about FoxDie.
0x58d2d: Now that there's no more danger of a nuclear strike from Metal Gear,
0x58d7f: he's going to do whatever's necessary to cover up the truth of what really happened here.
0x58de9: He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence along with anyone who knows anything...
0x58e6a: Don't worry, Snake.
0x58e88: I'll stop the nuclear strike.
0x58eb0: How?
0x58ebf: I may only be a figurehead here, but I'm still officially in command of this mission.
0x58f25: If I issue an order to delay the strike, it'll confuse the chain of command and at least buy you some time.
0x58fa1: It'll give you a chance to escape!
0x58fce: But Colonel, if you do that...
0x58ff7: It's okay, Snake.
0x59013: ...The truth is FOX-HOUND was already the subject of an undercover investigation.
0x59075: Meryl was transferred to this base just before the terrorist attack...
0x590c9: ...as a way of manipulating me.
0x59102: Those bastards...
0x59128: I'm sorry.
0x59147: They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.
0x5918a: You'd better get out of there, Snake.
0x591ba: Are you sure?
0x591d2: ...It'll be bad for you.
0x591f5: Don't worry.
0x5920c: It's the least I can do for you after all the lies.
0x5924d: Colonel...
0x59262: I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run.
0x5929c: After that there's no turning back...
0x592e0: Aaaah! What are you doing!?
0x59310: Snake!
0x5933f: Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel!?
0x59375: ...I don't believe it!!
0x59397: What happened!?
0x593b1: Snake, the Colonel...!!
0x593fd: Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty.
0x59432: This is the Secretary of Defense, Jim Houseman.
0x5946f: Put the Colonel back on!
0x59492: He's been placed under arrest for leaking top-secret information and for the crime of high treason.
0x59506: Ridiculous!
0x5951c: Yes, he's a ridiculous man.
0x59542: He truly believed that he was in command of this operation.
0x5958b: You bastard...!
0x595a5: There won't be a speck of evidence left.
0x595db: I'm sure the President would want the same thing.
0x5961a: The President ordered this?
0x59640: The President is a busy man.
0x59667: I have complete authority here.
0x59691: How do you plan on explaining a nuclear attack on Alaska to the media?
0x596e5: Don't worry.
0x596fc: We've prepared a convincing cover story.
0x59732: We'll simply say that the terrorists exploded a nuclear device.
0x5977f: ...Smart.
0x59793: You'll be murdering everyone here. The scientists, the Genome Army, everyone...
0x597f3: Donald...
0x59807: ...the DARPA Chief is already dead...
0x59837: So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA Chief after all?
0x5987a: He was my friend.
0x59896: And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh?
0x598e6: Well, if you give me the optic disc, I might consider saving them.
0x59936: What are you talking about?
0x5995c: Metal Gear's test data!
0x5997e: Donald was supposed to bring it back.
0x599ae: I don't have it.
0x599c9: I see. Oh well that's okay...
0x599f4: You two are an embarrassment from the 1970's.
0x59a2f: ...our country's dirty little secret.
0x59a5f: You can't be allowed to live.
0x59a87: Well, the bombs will be dropping soon, and you two have a lot of catching up to do.
0x59aeb: Farewell.
0x59b2b: Snake, it's me.
0x59b45: Otacon, good news.
0x59b62: Meryl's okay.
0x59b7a: All right!!!
0x59b91: You saved her, man. Good job!
0x59bb9: I got some bad news too.
0x59be6: We're about to be bombed.
0x59c0a: Oh boy. I guess we're considered expendable.
0x59c44: Is there a way out of here?
0x59c6a: A way out?
0x59c7f: ...Uh, yeah.
0x59c96: You can take the loading tunnel to the surface.
0x59cd3: There's a parking garage right next to you.
0x59d0c: The tunnel leads from there to the surface.
0x59d45: The door in front?
0x59d62: No. It's a small entrance to the west of that door.
0x59da3: How about the security?
0x59dc5: I just unlocked it.
0x59de3: Who do you think you're talking to?
0x59e11: I'll take care of security along your escape route too...
0x59e58: What are you going to do?
0x59e7c: Me?
0x59e8a: I...
0x59e99: I'll stay here.
0x59eb3: Are you crazy!
0x59ecc: I need a little more time to take care of your escape route.
0x59f16: But...
0x59f27: Unlocking the security doors is difficult work. Only I can do it.
0x59f83: Otacon?
0x59f95: Don't worry.
0x59fac: I'm staying here. It's my own decision.
0x59fe1: Otacon, this is a hardened shelter, but they're going to use a surface piercing nuclear bomb.
0x5a04f: It won't hold.
0x5a068: I'm through regretting the past...
0x5a095: Life isn't all about loss, y'know...
0x5a0c4: ..........
0x5a0d9: Snake, I'm a complete person now.
0x5a105: I've found a reason to live.
0x5a12c: Good.
0x5a13c: Don't die on me.
0x5a157: Same to you.
0x5a16e: Take care of Meryl, okay.
0x5a192: I will...
0x5a1a6: Okay I gotta go.
0x5a1c1: I promise I'll do something about your escape route.
0x5a203: Thanks.
0x5a216: "Thanks"...
0x5a22d: ...oh, that sounds nice.
0x5a250: ...I believe in you.
0x5a26f: Thanks, Snake.
0x5a2db: Snake, can you hear me?
0x5a2fd: Colonel!
0x5a310: Are you okay?
0x5a328: Colonel, what happened?
0x5a34a: The Secretary of Defense has been arrested.
0x5a383: Early retirement.
0x5a3a9: Arrested?
0x5a3bd: I was able to get into contact with the President.
0x5a3fd: Metal Gear, the training exercise... all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.
0x5a470: Acting alone?
0x5a488: What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?
0x5a4cb: The orders were rescinded.
0x5a4f0: The F117s and the B2 Spirits have returned to the base.
0x5a53f: Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.
0x5a587: I see...
0x5a59a: Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few secrets.
0x5a5ee: I wonder about that.
0x5a60d: In any case, the danger's over...
0x5a639: Thanks, Snake.
0x5a652: Colonel, you can rest easy.
0x5a678: Meryl's fine.
0x5a690: Really?
0x5a6a2: Thanks...
0x5a6b6: ...Thank you, Snake.
0x5a6e1: Snake.
0x5a6f2: I'm sorry I...
0x5a70b: ...I kept a lot of things from you.
0x5a739: It's okay, Colonel.
0x5a757: Snake,
0x5a768: I'm not a Colonel.
0x5a785: Oh that's right.
0x5a7a0: I've got a present for you.
0x5a7c6: There's a snowmobile close to you.
0x5a7f3: Mei Ling saw it on the satellite photos.
0x5a826: This time of the year the glaciers are pretty calm.
0x5a867: You should be able to ride right out of there.
0x5a8a3: I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you to come home alive.
0x5a903: Me neither.
0x5a919: I better not show my face around here.
0x5a94d: No danger of that.
0x5a96a: You two officially died after your jeep sank into the ocean...
0x5a9b6: That's not too far from the truth.
0x5a9e3: Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.
0x5aa29: Dr. Hal Emmerich should be somewhere on the base.
0x5aa68: I want someone to bring him in.
0x5aa92: I understand.
0x5aaaa: Leave it to me.
0x5aac4: Okay, Roy.
0x5aad9: Are you going to be okay?
0x5aafd: Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy.
0x5ab35: ...a hard copy of all Mei Ling's data.
0x5ab66: As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling will be fine.
0x5abb0: The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon.
0x5abf2: They won't be able to follow us.
0x5ac1d: I guess we won't meet again.
0x5ac44: Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.
0x5ac7d: Really? I'll look forward to that.
0x5acaa: Roy, just tell me one thing.
0x5acd1: What?
0x5ace1: About FoxDie.
0x5acf9: Meryl will be fine.
0x5ad17: She wasn't included in its programming.
0x5ad4c: What about me?
0x5ad65: It killed Liquid...
0x5ad83: Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.
0x5add2: How is she?
0x5ade8: Don't worry.
0x5adff: Mei Ling's with her right now.
0x5ae28: I'm switching over to Naomi.
0x5ae61: Snake, can you hear me?
0x5ae83: Colonel!
0x5ae96: Are you okay?
0x5aeae: Colonel, what happened?
0x5aed0: The Secretary of Defense has been arrested.
0x5af09: Early retirement.
0x5af2f: Arrested?
0x5af43: I was able to get into contact with the President.
0x5af83: Metal Gear, the training exercise... all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.
0x5aff6: Acting alone?
0x5b00e: What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike?
0x5b051: The orders were rescinded.
0x5b076: The F117s and the B2 Spirits have returned to the base.
0x5b0c5: Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.
0x5b10d: I see...
0x5b120: Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few secrets.
0x5b174: I wonder about that.
0x5b193: In any case, the danger's over...
0x5b1bf: Thanks, Snake.
0x5b1e4: Colonel, about Meryl...
0x5b210: I already know...
0x5b22c: ..........
0x5b241: Colonel?
0x5b254: Meryl was...
0x5b26b: ...my daughter.
0x5b28f: What?
0x5b29f: I didn't find out until recently.
0x5b2cb: I got a letter from her mother... my dead brother's wife...
0x5b314: I was going to tell her after this operation was over.
0x5b358: Colonel, I...
0x5b370: It's okay, Snake.
0x5b38c: Thanks, anyway.
0x5b3b0: Snake.
0x5b3c1: I'm sorry I...
0x5b3da: I kept a lot of things from you.
0x5b405: It's okay, Colonel.
0x5b423: Snake, I'm not a Colonel.
0x5b447: Oh that's right.
0x5b462: I've got a present for you.
0x5b488: There's a snowmobile close to you.
0x5b4b5: Mei Ling saw it on the satellite photos.
0x5b4e8: This time of the year the glaciers are pretty calm.
0x5b529: You should be able to ride right out of there.
0x5b565: I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you to come home alive.
0x5b5c5: Me neither.
0x5b5db: I better not show my face around here.
0x5b60f: No danger of that.
0x5b62c: You two officially died after your jeep sank into the ocean...
0x5b678: That's not too far from the truth.
0x5b6a5: Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.
0x5b6eb: Okay, Roy.
0x5b700: Are you going to be okay?
0x5b724: Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy.
0x5b75c: ...a hard copy of all Mei Ling's data.
0x5b78d: As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling will be fine.
0x5b7d7: The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon.
0x5b819: They won't be able to follow us.
0x5b844: I guess we won't meet again.
0x5b86b: Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime.
0x5b8a4: Really? I'll look forward to that.
0x5b8d4: Roy, just tell me one thing.
0x5b8fb: What?
0x5b90b: About FoxDie.
0x5b923: What about me?
0x5b93c: It killed Liquid...
0x5b95a: Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.
0x5b9a9: How is she?
0x5b9bf: Don't worry.
0x5b9d6: Mei Ling's with her right now.
0x5b9ff: I'm switching over to Naomi.
0x5ba48: Snake, it's me...
0x5ba64: Naomi...
0x5ba77: I heard about my brother...
0x5ba9d: I'm sorry...
0x5bab4: but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.
0x5bb0c: He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your own life.
0x5bb79: Frankie said that?
0x5bb96: Yeah. He also said he'll always love you...
0x5bbcf: Naomi, your brother just saved you, me and the whole world.
0x5bc18: He fought with every ounce of strength in his body.
0x5bc59: Maybe...
0x5bc6c: ...maybe now he's finally found some peace.
0x5bca5: He wasn't really my brother anymore...
0x5bcd6: Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar he's been like a ghost.
0x5bd25: A ghost looking for a place to die...
0x5bdd7: Naomi, Liquid died from FoxDie too.
0x5be05: What about me?
0x5be1e: When am I gonna go?
0x5be46: That's up to you.
0x5be62: What do you mean?
0x5be7e: Everybody dies when their time's up...
0x5beaf: Yeah, so when's mine up?
0x5bed2: It's up to you how you use the time left to you.
0x5bf10: Live, Snake.
0x5bf27: That's all I can say to you.
0x5bf4e: ..........
0x5bf99: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x5bff6: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x5c08e: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,
0x5c126: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x5c1c9: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.
0x5c2bb: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0x5c326: Master? What are you doing here?
0x5c357: Master? What are you doing here?
0x5c384: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0x5c3e3: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x5c485: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x5c4ca: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x5c509: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0x5c59d: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x5c5e8: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x5c62d: Well I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.
0x5c672: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0x5c6f0: My frequency is 141.80.
0x5c70d: 7dMASTER
0x5c75e: Snake, that's the door to the walkway.
0x5c78f: It won't open even if I use the card.
0x5c7bf: Huh? Oh that's right. I totally forgot...
0x5c7f3: Do you know something?
0x5c814: That door sometimes gets frozen shut cause it's so cold outside.
0x5c862: Next time tell me beforehand. So what should I do?
0x5c8a2: It's impossible to open from the inside. They always used C4 or something from the outside...
0x5c910: From the outside? You can't open it from the inside?
0x5c952: Sorry, it's impossible. But don't worry, you'll get through. There are two walkways that connect Tower A and Tower B. The other one's on the roof.
0x5c9f8: You should just use the walkway on the roof.
0x5ca44: It's no good, Snake. It looks like that door is frozen shut. The only way to open it is to blow it open from the outside.
0x5cad1: And since the walkway on the roof is destroyed, to get to Tower B, you'll have to take the walkway on the other side of that door.
0x5cb67: If you had a rope, maybe you could lower yourself from the roof of Tower A to the other side...
0x5cc50: 7 OTACON
0x5cc94: If you take that cargo elevator down, you'll wind up in Metal Gear's underground maintenance base.
0x5cd32: It's automatically set to go back and forth between the blast furnace and the underground maintenance base.
0x5cdae: It's not there yet, so you'll just have to wait.
0x5ce65: 7 OTACON
0x5cea9: That elevator is for transporting vehicles and building materials to the underground maintenance base.
0x5cf3f: So that's why it's so big.
0x5cf64: The elevator you're on right now is the No.1 elevator.
0x5cfa8: That elevator won't take you down all the way, so you'll have to switch to the No.2 elevator at the relay point.
0x5d04d: Snake, the elevator won't move unless you push the switch. There's a control panel, right? Get closer and press the Action Button.
0x5d15c: 7 OTACON
0x5d1b3: Snake, that's the relay point between elevator No.1 and elevator No.2.
0x5d207: Why was it set up this way?
0x5d22d: Well, for a long time it had been set up so that you could take one elevator all the way to the bottom,
0x5d2a5: but I heard that they changed it because of something to do with the structural integrity of the rock.
0x5d33a: The No.2 elevator is next to you, right? Transfer to that one.
0x5d398: That elevator is for transporting vehicles and building materials to the underground maintenance base.
0x5d42e: So that's why it's so big.
0x5d453: The elevator you're on right now is the No.1 elevator.
0x5d497: That elevator won't take you down all the way, so you'll have to switch to the No.2 elevator at the relay point.
0x5d593: 7 OTACON
0x5d5c3: If you take that elevator down,  you'll wind up in the warehouse.  Metal Gear's underground maintenance base is just past there.
0x5d6be: 7 OTACON
0x5d6ee: If you take that elevator down,  you'll wind up in the warehouse.  Metal Gear's underground maintenance base is just past there.
0x5d7b4: Ravens...
0x5d7c8: What?
0x5d7d8: There are a lot of ravens here.
0x5d814: Crows...
0x5d827: What?
0x5d837: There are a lot of crows here.
0x5d893: There were ravens around from before.
0x5d8c6: But for some reason they started to really increase in number around the same time that FOX-HOUND came to the base.
0x5d94d: It's really weird. I wonder what it could mean...?
0x5d99f: There were crows around from before.
0x5d9ce: But for some reason they started to really increase in number about the same time that FOX-HOUND came to the base.
0x5da54: It's rally wierd. I wonder what it could mean...?
0x5dafc: 7 OTACON
0x5db52: What the hell are all these ravens doing around here?
0x5db95: Ravens? ...you got me.
0x5dbc8: What the hell are all these crows doing around here?
0x5dc0a: Crows? ...you got me.
0x5dc5d: There were ravens around from before.
0x5dc90: But for some reason they started to really increase in number around the same time that FOX-HOUND came to the base.
0x5dd17: It's really weird. I wonder what it could mean...?
0x5dd69: There were crows around from before.
0x5dd98: But for some reason they started to really increase in number about the same time that FOX-HOUND came to the base.
0x5de1e: It's rally wierd. I wonder what it could mean...?
0x5de8b: I hacked into security.
0x5dead: Snake! I'm opening the door!
0x5df3b: 7 OTACON
0x5dfa5: Is there any cold medicine on this base?
0x5dffa: What's wrong, Snake? You caught a cold?
0x5e03d: I think there's some in the commander's room. There's a pharmaceutical storage room in the southwest of the 1st floor basement
0x5e0cf: ...of the Warhead Storage Building. There are other types of drugs there too.
0x5e14c: I gave directions to another soldier who had caught a cold.
0x5e195: Well it looks like he gave the cold to me.
0x5e23e: Snake, haven't you found Meryl yet?
0x5e291: You still haven't found Meryl?
0x5e2f8: She's dressed like one of the terrorists. But that's just on the outside, the inside hasn't changed. Watch for the way she walks...
0x5e3b5: Snake, she's dressed up like one of the terrorists. She won't be able to reveal herself if other soldiers are around.
0x5e43e: You'll have to find somewhere you can be alone with her.
0x5e4a2: Even dressed like that, she's all woman. You see? Isn't there somewhere only a woman can go?
0x5e567: Snake, the Warhead Storage Building that you're in has one floor above ground and two floors below ground. Why don't you search there too?
0x5e617: She said she was nearby, so she may be somewhere in the Warhead Storage Building.
0x5e6b8: Thank God Meryl's okay. She's a tough one all right. Although when you look at her, it's hard to imagine how tough.
0x5e73f: It must be the walk.
0x5e75e: Ha ha ha. Anyway, I'm glad she's okay.
0x5e78f: I also got a key from her. I think  I can use it to stop them from launching a nuke.
0x5e81c: Get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base. That's where the detonation code input system is.
0x5e8cb: Someone else must be controlling Meryl. Do something, Snake...save her.
0x5e923: What am I supposed to do? I don't even know where he is.
0x5e969: He's probably somewhere close by. He's just invisible.
0x5e9ad: How?
0x5e9bc: Stealth camouflage.  A technology I developed...
0x5ea10: Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around the user in such a way that they're rendered nearly invisible.
0x5ea97: But if you had Thermal Goggles,  you'd be able to see him.
0x5eaeb: Anyway, you can't see him with your naked eyes, but there must be some way to make him show up.
0x5eb7d: Snake, someone is just controlling Meryl's mind. You should be able to save her.
0x5ec25: Snake, someone is just controlling Meryl's mind. You should be able to save her.
0x5eca4: Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around the user in such a way that they're rendered nearly invisible.
0x5ed2b: But if you had Thermal Goggles,  you'd be able to see him.
0x5ed85: Please, Snake. You've got to save her.
0x5edfd: A psychic soldier...what a waste. I guess fighting was all he ever knew...
0x5ee55: Are you feeling sorry for him?
0x5ee7e: Mantis had incredible power...fantastic power. Maybe that power could have been used to make people happy.
0x5eef9: ...It's a sad thing when you see all that power being used just for war.
0x5ef4f: ..........
0x5ef86: Snake, Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north. Hurry!
0x5eff7: You should use your Night-Vision Goggles in dark places.
0x5f05c: If you want Night-Vision Goggles, there's a pair in the lab at the Warhead Storage Building.
0x5f11d: Otacon, have you ever seen a sniper rifle anywhere on this base?
0x5f16b: A sniper rifle?
0x5f185: Meryl's been shot...by an extremely good sniper.
0x5f1c3: Sniper...
0x5f1d7: A high quality sniper rifle is the only way I can fight back.
0x5f222: I...I saw a PSG-1 in the armory in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar.
0x5f280: The 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar? I have to go all the way back there?
0x5f2e0: Well...yeah...
0x5f2f9: What's wrong with you, Otacon?
0x5f322: Oh...nothing.
0x5f366: Otacon, where is there a sniper rifle?
0x5f397: There's a PSG-1 in the armory in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar....
0x5f41d: ..........
0x5f432: What is it?
0x5f448: Wolf...I...just....forget it.
0x5f492: ..........
0x5f4d3: ..........
0x5f554: Snake, it's dark inside the Communication Towers. You should use your Night- Vision or Thermal Goggles.
0x5f5ee: If you want Thermal Goggles, there's a pair on the same floor as my lab.
0x5f665: There's a pair of Night-Vision Goggles near my lab.
0x5f6c7: Be careful. There are always a lot of soldiers guarding the Communication Tower.
0x5f748: The walkway is directly between the Communications Towers. Head for there.
0x5f7da: Snake, that's the door to the walkway.
0x5f80b: It won't open even if I use the card.
0x5f83b: Huh? Oh that's right. I totally forgot...
0x5f86f: Do you know something?
0x5f890: That door sometimes gets frozen shut cause it's so cold outside.
0x5f8de: Next time tell me beforehand. So what should I do?
0x5f91e: It's impossible to open from the inside. They always used C4 or something from the outside...
0x5f98c: From the outside? You can't open it from the inside?
0x5f9ce: Sorry, it's impossible. But don't worry, you'll get through. There are two walkways that connect Tower A and Tower B. The other one's on the roof.
0x5fa74: You should just use the walkway on the roof.
0x5fac0: It's no good, Snake. It looks like that door is frozen shut. The only way to open it is to blow it open from the outside.
0x5fb4d: And since the walkway on the roof is destroyed, to get to Tower B, you'll have to take the walkway on the other side of that door.
0x5fbe3: If you had a rope, maybe you could lower yourself from the roof of Tower A to the other side...
0x5fc77: Snake, there's a walkway up on the roof, too. You should use that one.
0x5fd3c: So you figured out what I had in mind, huh?
0x5fd92: I can't believe it actually worked.
0x5fdc6: I can't believe it actually worked.
0x5fe08: It looks like you escaped. I'm glad.
0x5fe5e: No thanks to you.
0x5fe80: No thanks to you.
0x5fe9e: Too bad. I thought you'd be able to figure out what my plan was.
0x5ff13: What are you talking about? I was just lucky that security was careless.
0x5ff6f: What are you talking about? I was just lucky that security was careless.
0x6000b: If you're looking for your items, they're near where you were being tortured. Why don't you go get them?
0x600a9: If you knew that, why didn't you just bring them to me?
0x600ee: The guard was scary.
0x6010d: ..........
0x60146: If you go straight down the underground passageway north of the Cave, you'll arrive at the Communication Towers.
0x601ca: You should be able to go over the glacier by using the Communication Towers' walkway. Head for the towers.
0x6029b: Otacon, I'm up on the roof.
0x602c1: That was a pretty fast climb.
0x602e9: I wanted to go slowly. But someone there forced me to move faster.
0x60339: Hmm. Well you can relax cause there's an elevator in Tower B.
0x603a2: That walkway will take you to Tower B.
0x603e5: Snake, the walkway is on the roof of Tower A.
0x6045d: Snake, are you going to take on a Hind with your bare hands?
0x604a7: I'm not that big a fool. Isn't there a weapon I can use against him somewhere?
0x60524: There are Stinger missiles in Communications Tower B. I'm pretty sure they're near the entrance to the walkway.
0x605a7: If you had a rope, you could probably get them by dropping down from the roof.
0x60635: I saw a rope on the bottom floor of Tower A.
0x606ac: Wow, Snake. You're like an action movie star!
0x606e7: Totally different.
0x60704: Huh?
0x60713: This is real. Not some prearranged stunt. If I screw up, there are no retakes.
0x60772: Yeah...I guess you're right.
0x607bb: Snake, there are some places on the wall where steam from the heating system is spurting out. So be careful, it'll give you a nasty burn.
0x60895: The Stinger missiles are in a small room near the entrance to the walkway.
0x6091f: ..........
0x60940: Snake, I'm heading your way.
0x60967: What are you talking about?
0x6098d: There's something I've got to ask you...
0x609c0: Well what is it?
0x609db: Hmm...well ya see...I...I'll ask you when I see you...bye.
0x60a23: Wait a minute!
0x60a73: Snake, I'm heading your way.
0x60a9a: What are you talking about?
0x60ac0: There's something I've got to ask you...
0x60af3: Well what is it?
0x60b0e: Hmm...well ya see...I...I'll ask you when I see you...bye.
0x60b56: Wait a minute!
0x60b91: Snake, I'm coming out there. Just hold on, okay?
0x60c0e: You're gonna go after that Hind now?
0x60c3d: Yeah.
0x60c4d: I can still hear the sound of its rotors. It's just circling the tower. He must be waiting for you.
0x60cc1: Yeah, well you won't hear it for much longer.
0x60cfc: ...Good. In the meantime, I'll fix the elevator so you can use it later.
0x60d74: I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that Hind. It might take some time, so don't hurry.
0x60e24: Snake, are you okay!?
0x60e44: So far. How are you doing?
0x60e69: Sorry. The elevator's not working yet. It's strange. There's no problem with the motor and the power is on. I need a little more time...
0x60f27: I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that Hind. It might take some time, so don't hurry.
0x60fd7: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.
0x61095: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x61126: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.
0x611eb: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x612a1: Otacon, I can't see them! What should I do?
0x612da: Hmmm...Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around an object. That's how it makes them invisible.
0x61355: But it doesn't have the ability to mask heat.
0x613bb: Use your Thermal Goggles, Snake. You'll be able to see their heat signatures!
0x6144a: Huh? You don't have any Thermal Goggles? Well with your eyesight, you might be able to spot em if you look really hard.
0x614fc: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.
0x615ba: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x6164b: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.
0x61710: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x617a1: Otacon, which direction is the underground base?
0x617df: It's in the snowfield to the north of Tower B. The door is security level 6.
0x61863: The weather is terrible. Make sure you don't get lost out there.
0x618b1: Snake, I don't have to tell you, but it's bitter cold out there. It'd be dangerous to stay out in the Snowfield too long.
0x6198b: Otacon, where can I find ammo for the PSG-1?
0x619c5: I...I can't tell you.
0x61a07: ..........
0x61a46: ..........
0x61ac3: The elevator is stopped at a lower floor and it won't come up. Is there some way to get to an elevator that will take me down further?
0x61b5d: Well...there is one, but...
0x61b83: Where?
0x61b94: Can you see to the west of the blast furnace?
0x61bcf: You see that crane? I think if you go down those steps, you'll get to the other side.
0x61c35: Did you ever see anyone actually go down there?
0x61c72: No, but I've seen mice go there.
0x61c9d: Do I look like a mouse to you?
0x61cc6: Be careful of that crane, too.
0x61d11: If you stick close to those steps, I think you can make it to the other side...probably.
0x61d8e: There's a cargo elevator in the northeast part of the bottom floor. You can take that to Metal Gear's underground base.
0x61e19: You'll spot it right away. It's got a big patrol light attached to it.
0x61ea2: If you take that cargo elevator down, you'll wind up in Metal Gear's underground maintenance base.
0x61f40: It's automatically set to go back and forth between the blast furnace and the underground maintenance base.
0x61fbc: It's not there yet, so you'll just have to wait.
0x6201e: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x620a0: ...I'll be watching, Snake...
0x620f4: Snake, there's nowhere to hide in that elevator. You'll have to fight!
0x621b0: The elevator is stopped at a lower floor and it won't come up. Is there some way to get to an elevator that will take me down further?
0x6224a: Well...there is one, but...
0x62270: Where?
0x62281: Can you see to the west of the blast furnace?
0x622bc: You see that crane? I think if you go down those steps, you'll get to the other side.
0x62322: Did you ever see anyone actually go down there?
0x6235f: No, but I've seen mice go there.
0x6238a: Do I look like a mouse to you?
0x623b3: Be careful of that crane, too.
0x623fe: If you stick close to those steps, I think you can make it to the other side...probably.
0x6247b: There's a cargo elevator in the northeast part of the bottom floor. You can take that to Metal Gear's underground base.
0x62506: You'll spot it right away. It's got a big patrol light attached to it.
0x6257b: That elevator is for transporting vehicles and building materials to the underground maintenance base.
0x62611: So that's why it's so big.
0x62636: The elevator you're on right now is the No.1 elevator.
0x6267a: That elevator won't take you down all the way, so you'll have to switch to the No.2 elevator at the relay point.
0x6271f: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x627a1: ...I'll be watching, Snake...
0x627f5: That room is still under construction because their main priority was to finish Metal Gear's underground base.
0x62874: But the good thing is, with all those containers, it should be easy to hide, right?
0x6291a: It looks like they've finished getting Metal Gear ready.
0x62960: How do you know that?
0x62980: I overheard them talking.
0x629a4: Where are you now?
0x629c1: Right in front of Metal Gear. ...but it's strange.
0x62a01: What is?
0x62a14: There's nobody here...
0x62a35: ...no guards, nobody patrolling...
0x62a62: ...it's too quiet.
0x62a7f: Maybe because they're all ready.
0x62aaa: They said they even input the PAL codes.
0x62ae0: What should I do?
0x62afc: All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told you about.
0x62b5a: But I've only got one of the three keys.
0x62b8d: And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys...
0x62be6: Leave it to me...
0x62c02: You got some kind of plan?
0x62c27: Well, I'm in the computer room right now.
0x62c5e: I'm trying to access Baker's private files.
0x62c97: Baker's files?
0x62cb0: Don't you need a password?
0x62cd5: Of course. But there are ways...
0x62d0a: Are you a hacker?
0x62d30: Yup. That describes me pretty well.
0x62d61: Does it look like you can get in?
0x62d8d: I don't know yet.
0x62da9: I'll give it a try.
0x62dc7: I'm counting on you...
0x62e2d: I don't know anything about Dr. Naomi, so there's not much I can say...
0x62ea0: But, Snake, I think you'd better leave that to Colonel Campbell. Don't you think you'd better just get to the Control Room.
0x62f6d: How's it going?
0x62f87: Hmmm...not bad.
0x62fa1: I just got past his 3rd security level.
0x62fd3: He was a pretty careful guy.
0x62ffa: Do you think you'll break in soon?
0x63027: I've never met a system I couldn't bust into.
0x63062: Okay, keep trying...
0x630eb: That's where the emergency PAL code override system is.
0x63130: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the base you're in.
0x63179: Do you see that ladder next to Metal Gear?
0x631b1: You can climb up there.
0x631e5: Snake, Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north. Hurry!
0x6325a: Otacon. How's it going?
0x6327c: Not yet. Give me a little more time.
0x632eb: Snake, I did it!
0x63310: You got past security?
0x63331: Bingo!!!
0x63344: Great! So whaddya got?
0x63365: I accessed the confidential Metal Gear file.
0x6339f: So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about?
0x633eb: I haven't found it yet...
0x6340f: That's what I need to know!
0x63435: But Snake, I found something else!
0x63462: What?
0x6347c: The secret behind the new nuclear weapon!
0x634bd: Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun like a projectile...
0x63533: It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't considered a missile.
0x63577: That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties.
0x635c4: Pretty sneaky.
0x635dd: Yes, but effective.
0x635fb: And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon.
0x63642: I can't wait to hear this.
0x63667: It's a stealth weapon!
0x63692: You mean it won't show up on radar?
0x636c0: Yeah.
0x636d0: The truth is...they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70's.
0x6372b: Why weren't they able to develop one up until now?
0x6376b: Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system...it will be picked up by enemy satellites.
0x637d9: Oh yeah, that makes sense.
0x637fe: But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellent.
0x6384b: So it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems.
0x638a4: An invisible nuclear warhead...
0x638ce: Totally impossible to intercept.
0x638f9: And on top of that it's got a surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases.
0x63975: We learned that lesson in the Gulf War.
0x639aa: This thing could mean the end of the world!
0x639e3: It's the ultimate weapon.
0x63a07: And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.
0x63a7f: Colonel, is this true? Are you listening?
0x63ae0: I'm listening...
0x63afb: If word of this got out,
0x63b1e: it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident.
0x63b9c: Yeah, it would be nasty.
0x63bbf: The United States would be denounced by the U.N...it could even bring the President down...
0x63c2b: Did you know this, Colonel!?
0x63c70: I'm sorry...
0x63c87: You've changed, Colonel...
0x63cac: I won't make any excuses...
0x63ce6: Snake, listen to me.
0x63d05: This new nuclear weapon...it's never actually been tested, only simulated.
0x63d5d: You mean they ran a computer model?
0x63d8b: Yeah, that's why they were conducting this exercise.
0x63dcd: They needed to get actual experimental data to back up the simulation.
0x63e24: What were the results of the exercise?
0x63e55: It looks like it went better than they hoped for. But...
0x63e9b: I can't find the data anywhere on this network.
0x63ed8: You'd think that data as important as that would be carefully recorded...
0x63f2f: It was. President Baker gave me an optical disk with all of the test data.
0x63faf: What!? Do you still have it?
0x63fd6: No. Ocelot took it from me.
0x64006: Damn...
0x6402c: The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead.
0x6407d: Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch.
0x640d0: So you think they can do it?
0x640f7: Well, the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so.
0x6415e: Did you find out how to override it yet?
0x64191: Not yet. It must be in a separate file.
0x641c6: Right now I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files.
0x64210: We're counting on you...
0x6429d: That's where the emergency PAL code override system is.
0x642e2: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the base you're in.
0x6432b: Do you see that ladder next to Metal Gear?
0x64363: You can climb up there.
0x64397: Snake, Metal Gear is in an underground base to the north. Hurry!
0x6440c: Got it yet?
0x64422: Please, Snake, give me a little more time.
0x64486: How about it? Did you find the override system file?
0x644c8: Not yet. I need a little more time.
0x64515: Well, I found lots of information about that new nuclear weapon...
0x64565: There are 4 stages involved in launching a ballistic missile.  The first one is the Boost Stage.
0x645d6: It starts at the point the missile is launched and ends after all the rocket fuel is burned and the missile is propelled into the exosphere.
0x64676: The next stage is the Post-Boost Stage. It starts after all the fuel is burned and ends after the re-entry vehicle is ejected.
0x64708: Next is the Intermediate Course Stage. It takes place after the re-entry vehicle is ejected and lasts until the missile enters the exosphere.
0x647a9: Then comes the Final Stage. It starts when the re-entry vehicle enters the exosphere and it lasts until it reaches its ultimate target on the ground.
0x64852: Missile defense systems use military satellites to detect rocket emissions during the initial Boost Stage of a missile.
0x648dd: But this new nuclear weapon employs the rail gun's ability to fire projectiles at ultra-high velocities, instead of using a rocket.
0x64974: That's why it can't be detected by today's missile defense systems!
0x649c5: And on top of that, the re-entry vehicle also uses Stealth technology...
0x64a1b: It's so accurate that its fifty percent zone comes close to 50 meters.  That's as good as the best ICBM.
0x64a94: A highly accurate, undetectable, uninterceptable nuclear weapon. We wouldn't even be able to tell where it came from...
0x64b1f: And that's not all. A standard ballistic missile uses a 2-stage or a 3-stage solid fuel rocket for its propulsion system.
0x64bac: Besides costing lots of money, safely maintaining the solid rocket fuel and readying the missile for launch requires a lot of work.
0x64c43: But a railgun-launched nuclear warhead avoids all of those problems. And it's cheap too.
0x64cac: It's the perfect nuke. A general's dream...
0x64ce5: And the world's nightmare.
0x64d44: Did you find the file for the override system?
0x64d80: Just wait a little longer.
0x64dc4: I found out a lot about the arms industry though...
0x64e05: After the Cold War ended, the United States slashed its defense budget by more than 15%. Naturally, the arms industry was severely affected.
0x64ea5: It resulted in an orgy of mergers and acquisitions.
0x64ee6: Some of the big arms conglomerates today are made up of what 10 years ago would have been 20 or more smaller arms companies.
0x64f76: ArmsTech is one of those. But we lost our bid to produce the US Air Force's next line of fighter jets.
0x64fed: Then we took a stab at civilian applications, but that was a failure too. The company was about to go belly up.
0x65070: Ironically, the Defense Department was in pretty much the same situation.
0x650c7: Thanks to big budget cuts, they were forced to turn to the private sector to help fund their weapons development.
0x65149: On top of that, the government began to actively export their advanced weapons technology to the private sector...
0x651cf: ...in order to maintain a high standard of quality in the country's defense armaments.
0x65236: Eventually they decided on a joint development project for new weapon systems between the DOD and the private sector.
0x652bf: And...since both sides were in such bad financial shape, that's where all the backscratching came in.
0x65335: So there was another reason for the joint development of Metal Gear, huh. It wasn't just President Baker trying to keep ArmsTech afloat...
0x65437: The terrorists are finished inputting the detonation codes!
0x65480: The only way to stop the launch now is to re-input the detonation codes to lock the detonation mechanism. You need that key to do it.
0x65537: Find that key, Snake!  There's no other way!
0x65596: You found the card key, right?  First comes the room temperature key.  Put it into the far left terminal in  the Control Room.
0x6563a: Snake, the card key changed shape. You've got to change it back to room temperature!
0x656c0: That key is actually an IC card.  Its connector pins and main body  are made of a shape memory alloy.
0x65736: It's designed so that unless it has been changed to the correct shape,
0x6578a: it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the Control Room and the detonation code won't be entered.
0x65860: Snake, look at the card key.  It changed back! You have to  change it again!
0x658db: Snake, it looks like you changed  the card key's shape correctly.
0x6592a: Go and put it into the middle terminal in the Control Room. Before it warms up and changes back to its original shape.
0x659d9: Next you've got to cool the card key.
0x65a09: Where should I do that?
0x65a2b: This is Alaska. Go outside, it's cold everywhere.
0x65ad7: But you're close to the warehouse where you fought Raven, right?
0x65b25: That place is right in the middle of the permafrost layer and there's no heater either.
0x65c12: Next you've got to cool the key. You're close to the warehouse where you fought Raven, right?
0x65c80: That place is right in the middle of the permafrost layer and there's no heater either.
0x65cfa: Next you've got to cool the card key.
0x65d2a: Where should I do that?
0x65d4c: This is Alaska. Go outside, it's cold everywhere.
0x65db0: That key is actually an IC card.  Its connector pins and main body  are made of a shape memory alloy.
0x65e26: It's designed so that unless it has been changed to the correct shape,
0x65e7a: it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the Control Room and the detonation code won't be entered.
0x65f4e: Snake, look at the card key.  It changed back! You have to  change it again!
0x65fc9: It looks like you changed the shape correctly. The last card key goes in the far right terminal in the Control Room.
0x66051: But be careful. If you're in a cold place for too long, it'll change back to its original shape. You need to hurry.
0x660ea: Somewhere warm?  What about the blast furnace?
0x66126: But the problem is if you go through a cold place on the way back, the card key might change shape. You need to hurry on the way back.
0x661f1: That key is actually an IC card.  Its connector pins and main body  are made of a shape memory alloy.
0x66267: It's designed so that unless it has been changed to the correct shape,
0x662bb: it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the Control Room and the detonation code won't be entered.
0x6638f: Naomi's an enemy spy!? ...I can't believe it!
0x663ca: I don't want to believe it either, but...
0x663fe: Snake, leave it to Colonel Campbell. You've got to concentrate on re-inputting that detonation code.
0x66473: You're right...
0x664bb: Snake, look at the card key.  It changed back! You have to  change it again!
0x66536: It looks like you changed the shape correctly. The last card key goes in the far right terminal in the Control Room.
0x665be: But be careful. If you're in a cold place for too long, it'll change back to its original shape. You need to hurry.
0x66664: That key is actually an IC card.  Its connector pins and main body  are made of a shape memory alloy.
0x666da: It's designed so that unless it has been changed to the correct shape,
0x6672e: it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the Control Room and the detonation code won't be entered.
0x667d9: Somewhere warm?  What about the blast furnace?
0x66815: But the problem is if you go through a cold place on the way back, the card key might change shape. You need to hurry on the way back.
0x668de: That key is actually an IC card.  Its connector pins and main body  are made of a shape memory alloy.
0x66954: It's designed so that unless it has been changed to the correct shape,
0x669a8: it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the Control Room and the detonation code won't be entered.
0x66a7e: I can't really blame Dr. Naomi... I feel sorry for her.
0x66ac3: ...Ever since I was a little kid,  I always hated my first name.
0x66b11: Hal, isn't it?
0x66b2a: Yeah... But I'm not a computer, I'm a human...
0x66b66: ...My grandfather taking part in the Manhattan Project...my father being born on the day of the Hiroshima bomb...I hated every part of that.
0x66c06: My name, my father, my grandfather. ...It felt like all those things were a ball and chain around my legs, dragging me down..
0x66c97: But now that I think about it,  I realize that I was blessed.
0x66ce2: At least I know who I am...where I came from...
0x66d1f: But Dr. Naomi didn't even know who her parents were, what her real name was. She must have been a very lonely little girl...
0x66daf: Otacon...
0x66dc3: ...Sorry, Snake. I guess right now you should focus on re-inputting those PAL codes.
0x66e56: Snake, look at the card key.  It changed back! You have to  change it again!
0x66ed1: You still haven't input the final card key. Hurry to the Control Room.
0x66f37: That's not the right shape. Hurry and warm it up. The blast furnace is probably the best place.
0x66fe4: Snake, that's bullet-proof glass. You can't break it with an ordinary weapon.
0x6703f: Can't you open the security lock here?
0x67070: I'll try. Just hold on for a minute.
0x67129: C'mon hurry up already!
0x6714b: Hang on!
0x67186: I'm outta time!
0x671a0: Just hold on a little longer!
0x671f0: Otacon!
0x67202: Almost there. Hold on!
0x6724f: What are you doing? The door is open, Snake. Hurry up and go after Liquid!
0x672fa: Snake, Rex's armor is impregnable. You can't do any damage with the weapons you've got.
0x67362: Rex uses the latest advances in compound armor.
0x6739f: The only way you can pierce it is with a high performance HEAT (high explosive, anti-tank) round.
0x67411: So what do I do?
0x6742c: Rex's pilot seat operates exactly like a VR system.
0x6746d: It's got multiple sensors connected to a high tech interface used for the controls.
0x674d1: It's completely self-enclosed and  shut off from the outside environment.
0x67528: He's not using his naked eyes?
0x67551: That's right. So if you could somehow destroy the sensors...
0x6759b: Do you see that round plate on  Rex's left arm?
0x675d8: Yeah, that thing that looks like a shield?
0x67610: That's a radome. If you can destroy that thing, it won't be able to use its electronic equipment.
0x67682: So he'll be blinded?
0x676a1: Yeah. Try to hit that radome with a Stinger missile.
0x676e3: So that will stop it?
0x67703: No, Rex was designed so it can be controlled manually too.
0x6774b: Oh great.
0x6775f: The part that looks like a beak is where the pilot seat is. In an emergency it will open up.
0x677cc: Rex's armor is perfect.  You can't destroy it.
0x67808: You told me that already.
0x6782c: But the interior is a different story.
0x6785d: I get it...first I destroy the radome. That will force him to open up the pilot's seat.
0x678c5: Right. If you can shoot a Stinger missile into the cockpit, you'll destroy the computer control system.
0x6793d: You intentionally designed it with a weak point?
0x6797b: It's not a weak point. I like to think of it as a character flaw. People just aren't complete without some type of character flaw, don't you think?
0x67a22: I guess so. I owe you one, Otacon.
0x67a61: I saw it in President Baker's top secret files. Rex has a free electron laser mounted on its belly.
0x67ad5: It's a laser weapon that discharges a laser beam into an electron beam that's been accelerated using giant magnets.
0x67b5c: It can generate an incredible amount of energy...pretty close to 100 megawatts. That's ten times greater than any other laser out there.
0x67c42: First use a Stinger missile to destroy the radome and disable its electronics.
0x67cb0: I saw it in President Baker's top secret files. Rex has a free electron laser mounted on its belly.
0x67d24: It's a laser weapon that discharges a laser beam into an electron beam that's been accelerated using giant magnets.
0x67dab: It can generate an incredible amount of energy...pretty close to 100 megawatts. That's ten times greater than any other laser out there.
0x67e7d: I saw it in President Baker's top secret files. Rex has a free electron laser mounted on its belly.
0x67ef1: It's a laser weapon that discharges a laser beam into an electron beam that's been accelerated using giant magnets.
0x67f78: It can generate an incredible amount of energy...pretty close to 100 megawatts. That's ten times greater than any other laser out there.
0x68032: If Rex steps on you, it'll be all over. Be very careful when he gets close.
0x680a9: Rex is equipped with anti-tank missiles on both of his knees. They're a laser semi-active homing type that doesn't use wires.
0x6813a: The shooter uses a laser illuminator to bounce a laser beam off the target.
0x68193: After that, the missile uses the light reflected off the target to home in on it.
0x681f5: Fortunately, the missiles are tipped with HEAT rounds and not anti- personnel warheads. But if they hit you directly, you'll be sorry. Be careful.
0x682b9: The rail gun uses magnetism to fire projectiles.
0x682f7: By perfecting the process of shell acceleration, the railgun is able to fire a projectile with a muzzle velocity of over 100 kilometers per second.
0x6839e: It was originally going to be used,  as part of SDI, to shoot down enemy ICBMs outside the atmosphere.
0x68415: It's ironic that now it's going to be used to deliver a nuclear warhead...
0x6848b: Rex is the first actual prototype model, but they've been doing  virtual prototyping for a while now.
0x68501: They pop it into a VR simulation while it's still in the design phase.
0x68555: That way they can make improvements to the design while testing it under all sorts of simulated conditions.
0x685d4: So even though it's a prototype,  it's extremely well-designed.  Be careful!
0x6866f: First use a Stinger missile to destroy the radome and disable its electronics.
0x686de: I saw it in President Baker's top secret files. Rex has a free electron laser mounted on its belly.
0x68752: It's a laser weapon that discharges a laser beam into an electron beam that's been accelerated using giant magnets.
0x687d9: It can generate an incredible amount of energy...pretty close to 100 megawatts. That's ten times greater than any other laser out there.

0x69386: It was originally going to be used,  as part of SDI, to shoot down enemy ICBMs outside the atmosphere.
0x693fd: It's ironic that now it's going to be used to deliver a nuclear warhead...
0x69468: Rex is the first actual prototype model, but they've been doing  virtual prototyping for a while now.
0x694de: They pop it into a VR simulation while it's still in the design phase.
0x69532: That way they can make improvements to the design while testing it under all sorts of simulated conditions.
0x695b1: So even though it's a prototype,  it's extremely well-designed.  Be careful!
0x69688: Snake, I don't know anything about fighting. But, you've got to beat Liquid!
0x696f8: If you look like you're about to fall off the back of Rex, press any button rapidly. You'll be able to climb up more quickly.
0x6979d: Snake, I don't know anything about fighting. But, you've got to beat Liquid!
0x69876: 7 OTACON
0x698b9: Did you find Meryl?
0x698d7: Sort of. I'm positive I saw her come into this bathroom, but...
0x69927: There's only one exit, right?
0x6994f: Yeah.
0x6995f: Well then she must still be in there.
0x699ad: Is there any place she might be hiding in there?
0x69a52: 7 OTACON
0x69a9f: Snake, someone is just controlling Meryl's mind. You should be able to save her.
0x69b1e: Stealth camouflage works by bending the light around the user in such a way that they're rendered nearly invisible.
0x69ba5: But if you had Thermal Goggles,  you'd be able to see him.
0x69bff: Please, Snake. You've got to save her.
0x69c99: 7 OTACON
0x69cdc: Snake, don't kill the dogs...Please?
0x69d0b: What are you talking about.  If I don't kill them, they'll kill me.
0x69d5c: But those dogs are just innocent animals.
0x69d93: If they were guilty, it'd be okay?
0x69dc0: ...But you...you keep dogs, don't you?
0x69df1: So what!? This is war. My private hobbies have got nothing to do with it.
0x69e48: ..........
0x69e7f: Snake, those dogs...
0x69e9e: Gimme a break...
0x69ee9: 7 OTACON
0x69f58: What are you using the Codec for? I'm right here.
0x69fb5: Otacon, are you still okay?
0x69fdb: Yeah. Thanks to the stealth camouflage, that is.
0x6a019: I have a favor to ask. I need your help.
0x6a04c: I was wondering when you'd ask. What should I do?
0x6a08b: I've been captured.  I'm locked up here in this cell.
0x6a0ce: What cell?
0x6a0e3: There's a big torture machine nearby.
0x6a113: Okay. I know it. It's close. I'll be there right away.
0x6a157: Thanks.
0x6a19e: Otacon.
0x6a1be: I'm headed your way now. Can't you just relax?
0x6a219: I am relaxed. I just don't know how to kill time here.
0x6a25d: Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.

0x6a2e8: Otacon, are you there?
0x6a309: What is it?
0x6a31f: Was that you who opened the door just now?
0x6a357: What are you talking about?
0x6a37d: So it wasn't you!...Which means that...
0x6a3bd: The door is open right?  You've got to get out of there now!
0x6a426: You're right.
0x6a462: What are you doing? Now's your chance to get outta there, Snake!
0x6a4da: Did you use the ketchup? It took me a long time to find that. It's exactly the right color and consistency too.
0x6a55a: Use it wisely, okay?
0x6a58b: That's all I can do for you, Snake.

0x6a5fd: Otacon, are you there?
0x6a61e: What is it?
0x6a634: Was that you who opened the door just now?
0x6a66c: What are you talking about?
0x6a692: So it wasn't you!...Which means that...

0x6abc0: Snake, I don't know anything about fighting. But, you've got to beat Liquid!
0x6ac47: Is there any cold medicine on this base?
0x6ac9c: What's wrong, Snake? You caught a cold?
0x6acdf: I think there's some in the commander's room. There's a pharmaceutical storage room in the southwest of the 1st floor basement
0x6ad71: ...of the Warhead Storage Building. There are other types of drugs there too.
0x6adee: I gave directions to another soldier who had caught a cold.
0x6ae37: Well it looks like he gave the cold to me.
0x6af0c: So you figured out what I had in mind, huh?
0x6af62: I can't believe it actually worked.
0x6af96: I can't believe it actually worked.
0x6afd8: It looks like you escaped. I'm glad.
0x6b02e: No thanks to you.
0x6b050: No thanks to you.
0x6b06e: Too bad. I thought you'd be able to figure out what my plan was.
0x6b0e3: What are you talking about? I was just lucky that security was careless.
0x6b13f: What are you talking about? I was just lucky that security was careless.
0x6b1db: If you're looking for your items, they're near where you were being tortured. Why don't you go get them?
0x6b279: If you knew that, why didn't you just bring them to me?
0x6b2be: The guard was scary.
0x6b2dd: ..........
0x6b316: If you go straight down the underground passageway north of the Cave, you'll arrive at the Communication Towers.
0x6b39a: You should be able to go over the glacier by using the Communication Towers' walkway. Head for the towers.
0x6b494: 7 OTACON
0x6b4f5: Great job. You made it down!
0x6b53b: It wasn't easy.
0x6b567: No problem.
0x6b5c3: Snake, the doorway that leads from the walkway to Tower A is frozen shut. If you use some C4, you should be able to get through.
0x6b679: Maybe now would be a good time to blow that door open with some C4 so you can get through later.
0x6b72e: The Stinger missiles are in a small room near the entrance to the walkway.
0x6b7b8: ..........
0x6b7d9: Snake, I'm heading your way.
0x6b800: What are you talking about?
0x6b826: There's something I've got to ask you...
0x6b859: Well what is it?
0x6b874: Hmm...well ya see...I...I'll ask you when I see you...bye.
0x6b8bc: Wait a minute!
0x6b90c: Snake, I'm heading your way.
0x6b933: What are you talking about?
0x6b959: There's something I've got to ask you...
0x6b98c: Well what is it?
0x6b9a7: Hmm...well ya see...I...I'll ask you when I see you...bye.
0x6b9ef: Wait a minute!
0x6ba2a: Snake, I'm coming out there. Just hold on, okay?
0x6baa7: You're gonna go after that Hind now?
0x6bad6: Yeah.
0x6bae6: I can still hear the sound of its rotors. It's just circling the tower. He must be waiting for you.
0x6bb5a: Yeah, well you won't hear it for much longer.
0x6bb95: ...Good. In the meantime, I'll fix the elevator so you can use it later.
0x6bc0d: I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that Hind. It might take some time, so don't hurry.
0x6bcbd: Snake, are you okay!?
0x6bcdd: So far. How are you doing?
0x6bd02: Sorry. The elevator's not working yet. It's strange. There's no problem with the motor and the power is on. I need a little more time...
0x6bdc0: I'll repair the elevator while you're fighting that Hind. It might take some time, so don't hurry.
0x6be5a: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.
0x6bf18: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is in the north of the Snowfield.
0x6bfa9: I don't know why, but the elevator just started working again. If you take it all the way to the bottom of Tower B and go outside, you'll be in the Snowfield.

0x6c140: 7 OTACON
0x6c189: You're getting shot at? But to get where the Stinger missiles are, you have to make it down that walkway.
0x6c269: Great job. You made it down!
0x6c2af: It wasn't easy.
0x6c2db: No problem.
0x6c337: Snake, the doorway that leads from the walkway to Tower A is frozen shut. If you use some C4, you should be able to get through.

0x6d06b: Are you in the boiler room? Those pipes are really old. Once in a while they blow out steam, so be careful.
0x6d106: You call this once in a while?
0x6d1a8: 7 OTACON
0x6d1ec: If you take that cargo elevator down, you'll wind up in Metal Gear's underground maintenance base.
0x6d28a: It's automatically set to go back and forth between the blast furnace and the underground maintenance base.
0x6d306: It's not there yet, so you'll just have to wait.
0x6d382: The rail gun uses magnetism to fire projectiles.
0x6d3c0: By perfecting the process of shell acceleration, the railgun is able to fire a projectile with a muzzle velocity of over 100 kilometers per second.
0x6d467: It was originally going to be used,  as part of SDI, to shoot down enemy ICBMs outside the atmosphere.
0x6d4de: It's ironic that now it's going to be used to deliver a nuclear warhead...
0x6d542: Rex is the first actual prototype model, but they've been doing  virtual prototyping for a while now.
0x6d5b8: They pop it into a VR simulation while it's still in the design phase.
0x6d60c: That way they can make improvements to the design while testing it under all sorts of simulated conditions.
0x6d68b: So even though it's a prototype,  it's extremely well-designed.  Be careful!
0x6d6f4: Snake, I don't know anything about fighting. But, you've got to beat Liquid!
0x6d75d: If you look like you're about to fall off the back of Rex, press any button rapidly. You'll be able to climb up more quickly.
0x6d87a: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0x6d8e5: Master? What are you doing here?
0x6d916: Master? What are you doing here?
0x6d943: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0x6d9a2: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x6da44: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x6da89: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x6dac8: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0x6db5c: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x6dba7: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x6dbec: Well I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.
0x6dc31: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0x6dcaf: My frequency is 141.80.
0x6dccc: 7dMASTER
0x6dd28: The wolf dogs aren't attacking? Are you carrying something that might be causing them to act like that?
0x6ddc2: Those are wolf dogs in there. Just like their name, they're a cross between huskies and Alaskan wolves. They were bred to be used as sled dogs.
0x6de84: They were trying to create an animal that would combine the gentleness of a dog with the endurance and ferocity of a wolf.
0x6df12: But they didn't get the stamina and power they were hoping for.
0x6df5f: On top of that, their personalities wound up closer to wolves. Most of them won't even let you get close. That's why they never caught on.
0x6dffd: Oh that's right. You're a musher.
0x6e029: Yeah. And after they outlawed the use of hybrids in dog sled races in 2002, no one even wanted to breed them anymore.
0x6e0b2: I heard that most of them were put to sleep after that...
0x6e0f9: Yes, but some of the wolf dog pups that were thrown away went wild.  I've heard that wild wolf dogs hunt in packs just like wolves.
0x6e190: Better be careful.
0x6e24d: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0x6e2b8: Master? What are you doing here?

0x6e712: I want to ask you about Naomi.
0x6e73b: I'm looking into the details now, but it doesn't look good. Weren't you ever suspicious about her, Snake?
0x6e7b5: ..........
0x6e7ca: ...Snake, keep your guard up.
0x6e820: There are a lot of crows around here...
0x6e85e: Those aren't crows, those are Northern Ravens. The Inuit and other native Americans worshipped Northern Ravens as creator deities.
0x6e910: Some say that ravens have the power to predict death. The great poet Marlowe wrote about them in the 16th century.
0x6e997: "Thus like the sad presaging raven that tolls the sick man's passport in her hollow beak,
0x6ea01: And in the shadow of the silent night doth shake contagion from her sable wings."
0x6ea70: That's pretty gloomy, Master.
0x6eab7: By the way...
0x6eacf: What?
0x6eaeb: I've got something to tell you about Naomi Hunter.
0x6eb2b: What about her?
0x6eb45: Is this conversation secure?
0x6eb6c: Don't worry.
0x6eb83: The monitor's off.
0x6eba0: Okay.
0x6ebb0: What's up?
0x6ebc5: I was in the FBI too, y'know.
0x6ebed: I didn't know that. What's your point?
0x6ec1e: Dr. Hunter's story about her background...
0x6ec56: ...about her grandfather being an assistant secretary to Hoover in the FBI...
0x6ecb4: Yeah?
0x6ecc4: And then going undercover to investigate the mafia in New York..
0x6ed12: Yeah, what about it?
0x6ed31: It was all a big lie.
0x6ed5b: What did you say?
0x6ed77: It was really bothering me.
0x6ed9d: Why would she lie about it?
0x6edc3: She lied?
0x6edd7: She might be a spy!
0x6edf5: Ridiculous.
0x6ee0b: C'mon. Even a high school student could see past it.
0x6ee4d: The head of the FBI at that time, Edgar Hoover...he was a well-known racist.
0x6eeaa: Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese?
0x6eee6: Yeah...
0x6eef8: Well back then there wasn't a single Asian investigator.
0x6ef3e: Also, in the 1950's the undercover mafia sting operations hadn't even started yet.
0x6efa1: They first started in 1960...in Chicago, not New York.
0x6efe5: But...
0x6eff6: You better check it out.
0x6f019: The chief and the president mysteriously dying, that ninja...too many strange things are happening.
0x6f08d: Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it?
0x6f0c8: I don't know.
0x6f0e0: Either that or she's working with the terrorists.
0x6f11f: ...Could it be?
0x6f139: If I find out anything, I'll call.
0x6f166: In the meantime, be careful!
0x6f1bd: Ravens will eat vegetables, meat, garbage...pretty much anything.
0x6f20c: It seems dirty to us, but that's what allows them to live even in a climate like this.
0x6f291: Legends say that crows have three times the life span of a man, and that ravens have three times the life span of a crow.
0x6f31e: That's just an old wives' tale, but it's true that crows live longer than many types of birds. Northern Ravens can live pretty close to 70 years.
0x6f3ed: Some say that ravens have the power to predict death. The great poet Marlowe wrote about them in the 16th century.
0x6f474: "Thus like the sad presaging raven that tolls the sick man's passport in her hollow beak,

0x6fd39: ...Snake, keep your guard up.
0x6fd96: That place is right in the middle of  the permafrost. Just like the name says,  it never melts. I've heard over 85% of Alaska is permafrost.
0x6fe42: It's extremely cold there, Snake. If you don't hurry, your C-rations will freeze.
0x6fead: One way to prevent your C-rations from freezing is to hold them close to your body by equipping them.

0x70131: Snake, did you find the key?
0x70158: No, it's not here.
0x70175: Don't be ridiculous. You saw it fall into the drainage ditch, didn't you?
0x701cc: The drainage ditch...Isn't there something odd about it?
0x70212: No. There are a lot of big rats though...
0x70246: That's it, Snake! A rat must have eaten it!
0x7027f: Now, who's being ridiculous!
0x702a6: No, I'm right. There's no other possibility. Rats eat all sorts of things. There's nothing unusual about that.
0x70347: Snake, a rat ate that key. You'll have to get it back. Follow the rat's route!

0x70713: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x7075e: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x707a3: Well I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.
0x707e8: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0x70866: My frequency is 141.80.
0x70883: 7dMASTER
0x708e0: Snake, that's probably some type of nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a gas mask.
0x70992: A cardboard box, huh. Just like Zanzibar.
0x709c9: It saved my skin more than a few times in Outer Heaven too.
0x70a12: Getting the maximum use out of ordinary on hand objects is the first principle of survival. It's especially important for covert operations.
0x70ab2: I haven't forgotten what you taught me.
0x70b2c: You caught a cold, Snake? In battle you need to be in top physical condition. Do you have any cold medicine?
0x70bf4: Your C-rations are frozen? Never eat frozen C-rats. It'll cause a temperature imbalance that'll drain your strength.
0x70c79: Make sure you warm those C's before you eat em.
0x70d29: You say the DARPA Chief is dead!?
0x70d55: Yeah...According to Naomi, it was a heart attack.
0x70d94: It couldn't be...
0x70db0: Well...it looks like all you can do now is find Kenneth Baker, the president of ArmsTech.
0x70e1a: He's in the 2nd floor basement, isn't he?
0x70e51: Yeah, on the other side of the wall that was cemented over.
0x70e9a: Okay. Good luck, Snake.  You can do it...
0x70f06: Snake, you've got to think. Your mind is your most dangerous weapon.  If things are getting too complicated,  try to simplify your thoughts.
0x70fa6: You can also try calling Campbell for advice.
0x70fff: Soldiers that have been forged in the fires of battle are used to catching naps whenever and wherever they can.
0x71082: There's a big difference between real soldiers and those kids who have only been trained in VR simulators.

0x71166: People's reaction speed is slowest around three o'clock in the morning, and so is their judgment.
0x711d8: If you're feeling drowsy, you should get some sleep.
0x71238: It's also important to be able to control your bodily functions.
0x71286: You never know when a long demo is about to begin, so make sure you're prepared to sit in front of the monitor for a long time if necessary.
0x71344: It's never a good idea to fight on too full a stomach. It'll make you logy... maybe even sleepy.
0x713b5: You should wait 30 minutes after eating before you play.
0x71419: Where I come from, a soldier who loses his head in combat is called a "target."
0x71499: Military C-rations place an emphasis on calories.
0x714d8: That's why it's best to use them along with some other type of nutritional supplement such as vitamins or minerals.
0x7157d: The weather in Alaska is very hard to predict. It can change on a dime. A lot of people say it's the worst weather in the world.

0x71daa: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0x71e15: Master? What are you doing here?
0x71e46: Master? What are you doing here?
0x71e73: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0x71ed2: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x71f74: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?

0x725f2: Make sure you warm those C's before you eat em.
0x726a2: First the DARPA Chief and then President Baker die of a heart attack?
0x726f5: Yeah. Smells pretty rotten to me. Master, do you know anything?
0x72742: No..., but there's definitely something going on. Keep your eyes open out there.
0x727eb: Master, does the name Deepthroat mean anything to you?
0x7282f: Deepthroat? What? You mean the guy from Watergate?
0x7286f: No. But he uses the same name. Whoever he is, he's not part of our operation, but he's been giving me advice by Codec.
0x728f9: What?
0x72909: On top of that, he wasn't using burst transmission. It seems he was transmitting from somewhere on this base.
0x7298a: Somewhere on the base?
0x729ab: Yes.
0x729ba: ...I have no idea who that could be.
0x729e9: I see...
0x72a4e: Master, does the name Deepthroat mean anything to you?

0x72c1d: ...I have no idea who that could be.
0x72c4c: I see...
0x72c97: He's just playing with you. Why don't you try throwing away your weapons?
0x72d20: You managed to link up with Meryl. Good...So now you must have the card keys that will override the detonation code.
0x72da8: You should hurry, the time limit is running out.
0x72e31: Meryl's just being controlled. You're an expert at unarmed CQB (Close Quarters Battle), right? Stop her without using your gun, that's all.
0x72eee: Meryl must have somehow been brainwashed. There should be some way to help her.
0x72f6c: Meryl's just being controlled. You're an expert at unarmed CQB (Close Quarters Battle), right? Stop her without using your gun, that's all.
0x7301e: Meryl must have somehow been brainwashed. There should be some way to help her.
0x7316a: People who have been through war and survived develop a kind of sixth sense to warn them of danger. Trust your instincts as a soldier, as a gamer.

0x7329e: The slower you react, the greater the chance that you'll be beaten.
0x7330d: That inner voice that warns you when danger is nearby...you can't learn that in training.
0x73377: You've got to have survived a few firefights...seen a few friends blown away before you learn that trick.
0x7340f: When you're trying to hide, avoid places that look like the enemy might search.
0x7346f: Think about how your enemy is going to move and then sneak in there.  It doesn't matter how smart you are, just use your head out there.

0x77949: Master? What are you doing here?
0x7797a: Master? What are you doing here?
0x779a7: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0x77a06: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x77aa8: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x77aed: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x77b2c: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0x77bc0: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.

0x77c95: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0x77d13: My frequency is 141.80.
0x77d30: 7dMASTER
0x77d8d: Snake, that's probably some type of nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a gas mask.

0x784db: Soldiers who lose their heads on the battlefield usually lose their heads on the battlefield. Get my meaning? Always have your next action planned.

0x86134: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0x8619f: Master? What are you doing here?
0x861d0: Master? What are you doing here?
0x861fd: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0x8625c: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x862fe: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x86343: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x86382: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0x86416: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x86461: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0x864a6: Well I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.
0x864eb: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0x86569: My frequency is 141.80.
0x86586: 7dMASTER
0x865e3: Snake, that's probably some type of nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a gas mask.
0x86695: A cardboard box, huh. Just like Zanzibar.
0x866cc: It saved my skin more than a few times in Outer Heaven too.
0x86715: Getting the maximum use out of ordinary on hand objects is the first principle of survival. It's especially important for covert operations.
0x867b5: I haven't forgotten what you taught me.
0x8682f: You caught a cold, Snake? In battle you need to be in top physical condition. Do you have any cold medicine?
0x868f7: Your C-rations are frozen? Never eat frozen C-rats. It'll cause a temperature imbalance that'll drain your strength.
0x8697c: Make sure you warm those C's before you eat em.
0x86a2c: Master, you and I...we're nothing more than dogs, are we?
0x86a73: That's not like you, Snake...Don't let what Sniper Wolf said bother you.
0x86ac9: ..........
0x86ade: Listen. There's not a soldier alive that doesn't question himself. And if there is one, he's nothing more than a murderer.
0x86b6c: But someone like Wolf...a soldier who's looking for nothing more than their own death is no good to anyone either.
0x86bf2: Once she started to look for death, it was all over.
0x86c34: That's how you'll end up too, Snake...
0x86c9d: Naturally, in an enclosed room, your motion is limited. But that doesn't mean that you should stand still and become a human target.
0x86d35: You can win if you watch how your enemy moves and then cleverly counter it.
0x86e0a: That place is right in the middle of  the permafrost. Just like the name says,  it never melts. I've heard over 85% of Alaska is permafrost.
0x86eb6: It's extremely cold there, Snake. If you don't hurry, your C-rations will freeze.
0x86f21: One way to prevent your C-rations from freezing is to hold them close to your body by equipping them.
0x86fc5: That place is right in the middle of  the permafrost. Just like the name says,  it never melts. I've heard over 85% of Alaska is permafrost.

0x870ea: One way to prevent your C-rations from freezing is to hold them close to your body by equipping them.
0x87183: They're already frozen.
0x871a5: You can warn them up by equipping them. After a while, they should be okay to eat.
0x87228: An Native Alaskan American, huh? Probably Athapaskan. They're originally from the same tribe as the Apaches and Navajos of New Mexico.
0x872c2: Anthropologically, they're related to the Japanese. There are even linguistic similarities between
0x87335: Athapaskan languages and ancient Japanese. You and he probably share many of the same ancestors.
0x873c5: ...Master, I don't remember telling you that I was part Japanese...
0x87416: ..........
0x8744b: The Four Man carry is a race where you have to run with four grown men hanging from a long stick that you carry on your back.
0x874dc: Apparently Raven does it with six men.
0x8753e: That place is right in the middle of  the permafrost. Just like the name says,  it never melts. I've heard over 85% of Alaska is permafrost.
0x875ea: It's extremely cold there, Snake. If you don't hurry, your C-rations will freeze.

0x87b3f: ..........
0x87b69: The Four Man carry is a race where you have to run with four grown men hanging from a long stick that you carry on your back.
0x87bfa: Apparently Raven does it with six men.
0x87c61: Snake, I'm sure that woman calling herself Naomi is some type of spy.
0x87cb4: And now I'm starting to think that Campbell might be hiding something too. Don't trust him.
0x87d79: Snake, isn't the detonation code input system in the Control Room? Hurry up and get in there!
0x87e53: Snake, did you find the key?
0x87e7a: No, it's not here.
0x87e97: Don't be ridiculous. You saw it fall into the drainage ditch, didn't you?
0x87eee: The drainage ditch...Isn't there something odd about it?
0x87f34: No. There are a lot of big rats though...
0x87f68: That's it, Snake! A rat must have eaten it!
0x87fa1: Now, who's being ridiculous!
0x87fc8: No, I'm right. There's no other possibility. Rats eat all sorts of things. There's nothing unusual about that.
0x88069: Snake, a rat ate that key. You'll have to get it back. Follow the rat's route!
0x880d9: You lost the key? Hurry up and find it! They've already entered the detonation code!
0x8815d: The only way to stop that launch is to lock the system by re-inputting the detonation codes.
0x88206: If you use the Mine Detector, you should be able to find the key even if it fell into the drainage ditch. Whatever you do, find that key!
0x882cd: You got the card key back? Good job. Hurry and input it.
0x88325: You got the card key back? Good job. Now hurry to the Control Room.
0x883b5: The key changed shape.  Hurry to the Control Room and input it.
0x88414: Now freeze that key.  Get somewhere cold!
0x88475: Now you've gotta warm it.  You need to find someplace hot.
0x884f8: So Naomi is a spy, just like I thought. Campbell is hiding something too...
0x88551: But that's okay. FoxDie is a virus... a biological weapon. There must be a vaccine.
0x885b5: We can worry about getting that later, Snake, but right now you've got to focus on re-inputting those detonation codes. Okay?
0x88674: The key changed shape. Hurry to the Control Room! That's the last key!
0x886e7: Master, I've never heard you so excited.
0x88729: ..........
0x88762: Now you've gotta warm it.  You need to find someplace hot.
0x887e7: So Naomi used FoxDie to take her revenge on you...

0x98e48: Yeah. That was quite a surprise all right.
0x98e80: Hiding a bomb in your items...that's a despicable act. He should never... Well, forget it. You'd better hurry to the underground base.
0x98f1a: You're almost out of time.
0x98f7d: Master, does the name Deepthroat mean anything to you?
0x98fc1: Deepthroat? What? You mean the guy from Watergate?
0x99001: No. But he uses the same name. Whoever he is, he's not part of our operation, but he's been giving me advice by Codec.
0x9908b: What?
0x9909b: On top of that, he wasn't using burst transmission. It seems he was transmitting from somewhere on this base.
0x9911c: Somewhere on the base?
0x9913d: Yes.
0x9914c: ...I have no idea who that could be.
0x9917b: I see...
0x991d0: So you beat Wolf, huh. She was a fool to use the same tactics that failed her in your first meeting.
0x99245: But remember. Don't let down your guard until you've got a confirmed kill.
0x992df: Master, you and I...we're nothing more than dogs, are we?
0x99326: That's not like you, Snake...Don't let what Sniper Wolf said bother you.
0x9937c: ..........
0x99391: Listen. There's not a soldier alive that doesn't question himself. And if there is one, he's nothing more than a murderer.
0x9941f: But someone like Wolf...a soldier who's looking for nothing more than their own death is no good to anyone either.
0x994a5: Once she started to look for death, it was all over.
0x994e7: That's how you'll end up too, Snake...
0x9954d: Sound travels better in cold  environments. If you're going to  use a handgun, you should equip  a suppressor.
0x995ed: When the temperature falls down to minus 30 or minus 40 degrees celsius, you start to get ice fogs. That's when the moisture in the air freezes.

0x9970f: Kipling, an English poet who also won the Nobel prize, said that once you go beyond 65 north,
0x9977d: you're beyond the reach of divine protection and human law.
0x997c6: To survive in such surroundings, you have to be strong enough to not rely on God or anyone else.
0x99855: In cold like this, over 70% of your body warmth is lost through your head. Put on some kind of hat.
0x998e8: I hate hats. Is a bandanna okay?
0x99913: Well, I guess it's better than nothing...
0x99977: In an arctic environment, it's important to change your underwear if you're sweating a lot. Dawdle around too much and you'll not only waste your
0x99a1c: strength, but you could even catch pneumonia. Gaming after a bath should be avoided.
0x99a9f: It's easy to dehydrate in sub-zero climates, so make sure to replenish your fluids. But don't ever try to do it by eating snow.
0x99b32: You'll freeze your stomach and your body temperature will drop. Always melt the snow and then boil it before you drink it.
0x99bde: No cold foods or cold liquids for you. That stuff causes a temperature imbalance that actually drains your body of energy.
0x99c6c: A golden rule in arctic environments.

0x9a5ac: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0x9a64e: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x9a693: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0x9a6d2: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0x9a766: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.

0x9a94e: Don't suddenly look into the dark. Look slowly from a light area to a darker area.
0x9a9b1: If you do that, your eyes will gradually adjust and you'll be able to see better in the dark. Try not to play in the dark either.
0x9aa64: When you're fighting in the dark,  you need to use your sense of hearing and smell. Don't trust your eyes,  use your ears.

0x9b7db: Once you give up hope, it's all over. That's when you can't do anything right. Despair leads to death, you know.
0x9b87d: You've got to believe. If you believe with your whole heart, you will succeed.
0x9b8fa: Sometimes in combat or when you're near the end of your rope, you can see things that normally aren't there or shouldn't be there.

0xa945e: In war, a split second can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Don't ever hesitate.
0xa94ce: The slower you react, the greater the chance that you'll be beaten.
0xa9532: That inner voice that warns you when danger is nearby...you can't learn that in training.
0xa959c: You've got to have survived a few firefights...seen a few friends blown away before you learn that trick.
0xa9629: When you're trying to hide, avoid places that look like the enemy might search.
0xa9689: Think about how your enemy is going to move and then sneak in there.  It doesn't matter how smart you are, just use your head out there.
0xa9738: Snake, divide and conquer. Try to take your enemies on one at a time.
0xa97b5: Snake, you've got to think. Your mind is your most dangerous weapon.  If things are getting too complicated,  try to simplify your thoughts.
0xa9855: You can also try calling Campbell for advice.
0xa98ae: Soldiers that have been forged in the fires of battle are used to catching naps whenever and wherever they can.
0xa9931: There's a big difference between real soldiers and those kids who have only been trained in VR simulators.
0xa99ac: After playing for a long time,  you should get some rest too.
0xa9a15: People's reaction speed is slowest around three o'clock in the morning, and so is their judgment.
0xa9a87: If you're feeling drowsy, you should get some sleep.
0xa9ae7: It's also important to be able to control your bodily functions.
0xa9b35: You never know when a long demo is about to begin, so make sure you're prepared to sit in front of the monitor for a long time if necessary.
0xa9bf3: It's never a good idea to fight on too full a stomach. It'll make you logy... maybe even sleepy.
0xa9c64: You should wait 30 minutes after eating before you play.
0xa9cc8: Where I come from, a soldier who loses his head in combat is called a "target."
0xa9d48: Military C-rations place an emphasis on calories.
0xa9d87: That's why it's best to use them along with some other type of nutritional supplement such as vitamins or minerals.
0xa9e2c: The weather in Alaska is very hard to predict. It can change on a dime. A lot of people say it's the worst weather in the world.
0xa9ede: Snake, you've got to think. Your mind is your most dangerous weapon.  If things are getting too complicated,  try to simplify your thoughts.
0xa9f7e: You can also try calling Campbell for advice.

0xaa508: The weather in Alaska is very hard to predict. It can change on a dime. A lot of people say it's the worst weather in the world.
0xaa61f: The most important tools you need to be a good sniper are the senses that you were born with. No amount of training can change those.
0xaa6b8: If your senses are dull from the beginning, you'll never be a great sniper.
0xaa732: According to the SWAT manual, the longest a shooter can stay adequately focused on his target is 15 minutes.
0xaa7af: After 15 minutes, the observer and  the shooter change places. Sniping is usually a two man job.
0xaa83e: It looks like your target is stationary.  If you've had enough practice,  it shouldn't be a difficult shot.
0xaa8d8: The scope of a sniper rifle is extremely powerful. On the other hand, it's got a very narrow field of vision.
0xaa959: If you're searching for your enemy's position, it'd be better to use your binoculars.
0xaa9dd: The most important tools you need to be a good sniper are the senses that you were born with. No amount of training can change those.

0xaadee: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0xaae59: Master? What are you doing here?
0xaae8a: Master? What are you doing here?
0xaaeb7: I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some peace and quiet.
0xaaf16: I'm in retirement just like you. Once in a while I still help train the Alaskan Scouts.
0xaafb8: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0xaaffd: Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh?
0xab03c: Campbell told me about the situation here. I thought I might be of some use.
0xab0d0: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0xab11b: There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you.
0xab160: Well I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.
0xab1a5: I've lived in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions about the flora or fauna out here.
0xab223: My frequency is 141.80.
0xab240: 7dMASTER
0xab27a: If you leave a lot of footprints, you can confuse your enemy. But don't let your footprints reveal the direction you went in.
0xab30b: Disguise your footprints to fool the enemy.
0xab3d2: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.

0xab807: My frequency is 141.80.
0xab824: 7dMASTER
0xab86d: Those mice are Alaskan field mice. Don't worry. They can't hurt you.
0xab8cb: Wild field mice don't have a thick layer of fat, but they can still survive the bitter winters here without hibernating.
0xab957: They dig tunnels under the snow and that's where they stay warm.
0xab9a5: Survival specialists, huh? I should learn from them.
0xab9e7: But there's a dark side too. Sometimes the males will kill and eat offspring that's not their own.
0xaba5a: To ensure the survival of their own genes, right?
0xaba99: Yeah. Pretty brilliant program, huh?
0xabae1: If there are mice, that means there must be an exit somewhere. Follow the mice.
0xabb6f: Those mice are Alaskan field mice. Don't worry. They can't hurt you.
0xabbd4: If there are mice, that means there must be an exit somewhere. Follow the mice.
0xabcc4: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.

0xac163: Snake, that's probably some type of nerve gas. It's extremely lethal. Use a gas mask.
0xac1db: Snake, that floor is designed so that your footsteps echo.
0xac242: Listen, Snake. There's a way to walk so that your footsteps won't be heard. I call it "stalking." Here's how you do it.
0xac2cf: First, put your weight on the opposite foot that you're going to step with. Then take a step so that your heel makes contact with the ground first.
0xac376: Then as you slowly lower the tip of your foot to the floor, gradually shift your weight onto that foot.
0xac3ee: Use your knees to maintain the subtle balance. Try it.
0xac432: I...I can't do it...
0xac451: Another way is to wear your socks over your shoes...
0xac4b1: If you crawl on your stomach, you won't make any noise either...
0xac58d: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.
0xac5f8: Master? What are you doing here?

0xac9df: 7dMASTER
0xaca42: The muzzle velocity of a bullet fired from a revolver is slower than one fired from an automatic. That's bad for you.
0xacacb: The slower a gun's muzzle velocity, the more damage it does.
0xacb15: That's cause the bullet will tend to lodge in the body instead of going right through.
0xacb7c: Those kind of wounds take a long time to heal. Sometimes they never do. I think that's part of the reason he likes that gun.
0xacc0c: He's a real sick puppy, that Ocelot...
0xacc5b: The biggest drawback to a revolver is the reload time. That's your chance!
0xacd41: Snake, this is McDonell Miller. It's been a long time.

0xad765: Meryl's just being controlled. You're an expert at unarmed CQB (Close Quarters Battle), right? Stop her without using your gun, that's all.
0xad822: Meryl must have somehow been brainwashed. There should be some way to help her.
0xad8a0: Meryl's just being controlled. You're an expert at unarmed CQB (Close Quarters Battle), right? Stop her without using your gun, that's all.
0xad952: Meryl must have somehow been brainwashed. There should be some way to help her.
0xad9ea: It's true...your enemy is a powerful telepath. But you've got more battle experience. You can do it, Snake!

0xadf88: Snake, now's your chance. Take it. Get out of there!
0xae022: Normally, when a soldier is taken prisoner, he should only give up the Big 4.
0xae080: That's name, rank, serial number and date of birth. But you're not any old soldier, Snake.
0xae0eb: I don't want you to tell them anything. Fortunately, you're strong enough to resist.
0xae184: Don't say anything to tease or anger the person torturing you. If you make him mad, it'll be that much worse for you. You'll need to save your strength.
0xae260: If you get a chance to eat, don't pass it up. A prisoner can't be choosy.
0xae2b7: You need to get your strength back so you can escape when the opportunity presents itself.
0xae356: Snake, you'll get a chance to escape. Make sure you take it.
0xae3b4: Master, I...
0xae3cb: Don't say it, Snake. You still have a mission to accomplish. That's all you should be concentrating on right now.
0xae478: In any case, don't you think you should contact Colonel Campbell?
0xae4f7: First you have to change the shape of the last key.
0xae564: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xae60f: You better use that weapon you found!
0xae651: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xae6c5: Snake, Meryl's not herself.  Don't use your weapon.
0xae71a: It's Psycho Mantis. He's controlling Meryl. That tune is his mind control music.
0xae7a5: Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.
0xae85a: That's Psycho Mantis...former KGB psychic. He has powerful telepathic abilities.
0xae8bb: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America looking for a job. He worked with the FBI on several cases as a psychic profiler.
0xae95b: Five years ago he was working on the case of a multiple serial murderer ...and he got too far into the killer's mind.
0xae9e4: As a result, he became just like the killer.
0xaea32: So he was sort of infected by this serial murderer's thoughts...?
0xaea95: In any case, after that he became sort of a psychic spy working for the highest bidder. He travelled all around the world.
0xaeb23: That's when he was recruited by FOX-HOUND.
0xaeb67: He can read people's minds. He knows every move that you're going to make. 
0xaebc3: What should I do? I've got no chance of beating him.
0xaec19: There must be some way.
0xaec4f: He's a master at controlling people. Snake! Don't let him manipulate you!
0xaecc4: Not everything you see with your two eyes is real. Destroying his spirit is more important than destroying his body.
0xaed60: Don't let him read you. Be a blank slate! Okay? Clear your mind.
0xaedcc: He read your mind with his psychic abilities. Somehow you've got to get around him!
0xaee6d: I've got it. Use the Controller port!!
0xaee9e: Plug your Controller into Controller port 2. If you do that he won't be able to read your mind!
0xaef6a: Snake, is there some reason you can't use Controller port 2?
0xaefb4: Oh well, it's okay. Do you see something that looks like a statue on both sides of the room?
0xaf021: Yeah. You mean those things with their faces all wrapped up in leather bands?
0xaf07f: Yes. Attack those statues to uncover their faces.
0xaf0be: Why?
0xaf0e1: Those statues were modeled after Mantis' real face.
0xaf122: Mantis despises the sight of his own face. If he suddenly sees his own disfigured face staring at him, it might break his concentration.
0xaf1fa: Snake, if you destroy the faces of those statues, you should be able to disturb Mantis' psychic powers.
0xaf286: He's using his psychic ability to read your Controller's moves. That's how he's evading your attack.
0xaf2fb: You've got to do something so he can't read your Controller's moves. Think! There must be some way!
0xaf39d: Snake, isn't Meryl waiting for you?
0xaf3df: It's rude to keep a lady waiting.
0xaf447: Snake, Meryl's in danger! Find a sniper rifle so you can shoot back at Wolf! It's the only way to save Meryl!
0xaf504: Snake!! What the hell!! Are you trying to kill Meryl!!?
0xaf569: Have you gone insane!?
0xaf5b2: Stop it! You'll kill her!
0xaf5fe: Snake, stop!!
0xaf63e: You're terrible, Snake!!
0xaf689: Stop it! You'll kill her!
0xaf6ca: Snake, stop!!
0xaf6ff: You're terrible, Snake!!
0xaf752: No!! I can't believe it!! Snake has gone insane!
0xaf7a4: Snake, you're a poor excuse for a man!...
0xaf807: You got a PSG-1? You can use that against Sniper Wolf. Hurry up and save Meryl!
0xaf8a6: Snake, be careful. They've set up new gun cameras and increased their patrols. They don't want you to get away.
0xaf947: You can either destroy them with a Grenade or jam them with your Chaff...
0xaf99e: You won't be able to get on the elevator unless you disable those gun cameras.
0xafa30: First you've got to retrieve your items.
0xafa91: Snake, get that bomb out of your items!
0xafac6: Select the bomb in the Equipment Window and press the O button to throw it away!
0xafb27: Hurry! Throw it away!
0xafb73: If the Remote Controlled Missile goes too far away, you'll lose control over it. Be careful.
0xafc0c: Here's how to rappel.
0xafc2c: Press the X button to jump away from the wall. While you're away from the wall, press down on the Directional Button to drop down.
0xafcc2: If you jump while pressing right or left on the Directional Button, you can make a big jump in that direction.
0xafd41: If you press and hold the O Button while using the Directional Button, you can walk slowly across the wall.
0xafdbd: If you're careful with the timing, you should be able to dodge the gunfire from the Hind while you rappel down. If anyone can do it, you can Snake!
0xafea0: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0xafefa: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0xaff59: Colonel, listen to me. I found a parachute near the wreckage of the Hind.
0xaffc9: A parachute? You don't think that Liquid survived....?
0xb000d: Impossible. As soon as he jumped out of the pilot's seat, he'd be sliced up faster than an onion on an infomercial.
0xb00a5: ...So what's that parachute doing there then?
0xb00e0: I have no idea.
0xb010e: A trap?
0xb0120: Either that or a message...to me.
0xb014c: ...Meaning "I'm not dead", I suppose...
0xb0180: Maybe...but I think it's more like "I'll string you up!"
0xb01dc: ..........
0xb0205: Well, in any case, don't let your guard down.
0xb0240: I won't.
0xb027f: The entrance to the underground base is further below.
0xb02c3: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there. Try to find it.
0xb035f: Snake, take that elevator all the way down to the underground base.
0xb03f0: It looks like that elevator you were riding on won't go any further down. Switch to the other elevator.
0xb047a: Metal Gear is straight down. Better move it!
0xb04d3: There's no time.  The terrorists are ready to launch.
0xb0516: Negotiations are all finished?
0xb053f: The government can't cave in to terrorist's demands.
0xb0581: But they're threatening to launch a nuclear weapon!
0xb05c2: They've made their final decision.
0xb05ef: ...Why is the White House being so inflexible?
0xb062b: ..........
0xb0640: Colonel, is there still something you're hiding from me?
0xb0686: Snake, please...just concentrate on stopping them, okay?
0xb070c: Snake, we're not paying you to be a scarecrow y'know.
0xb078c: Poor things. Ravens are God's creatures too, Snake.
0xb081b: Colonel, where's Naomi?
0xb0851: I'm right here, Snake. What is it?
0xb087e: Oh...uh...nothing. Forget it.
0xb08a6: Strange...
0xb08f7: ...Snake, by now those terrorists have finished their launch preparations. Stop wasting time!
0xb0971: Metal Gear's base is up ahead.
0xb09cd: Snake, it's over 30 below outside...
0xb0a17: Be careful, you're just recovering from a cold...
0xb0a64: ..........
0xb0a79: What's wrong?
0xb0a91: Forget it, thanks.
0xb0af6: Snake, stop lollygagging around and get to Metal Gear's base. There's no time!
0xb0bc1: Snake, that water is contaminated with nuclear waste material. If you go in there, you'll take damage.
0xb0c57: Nuclear waste?
0xb0c70: They were extremely careless with their handling of nuclear materials. Nastasha knows all about that if you want more info.
0xb0d1e: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb0d8b: Snake, get that card key back from the rat. Why don't you watch its route and set up a trap for it with the C4 or something.
0xb0e2d: Find that key! It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch!
0xb0ea7: Use your Mine Detector.
0xb0ee8: Mine Detector?
0xb0f01: Yes. The Mine Detector works just like a metal detector. The position of the card key should show up on your radar screen.
0xb0fb7: Snake, they've input both detonation codes. The only way to stop the launch now is to use the card key to re-input the codes.
0xb1054: Find that card key! It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch!
0xb10b8: You got the card key...good. Now get back to the Control Room and use that key to re-input the PAL codes. Stop that launch!
0xb115b: Snake, that water is contaminated with nuclear waste material. If you go in there, you'll take damage.
0xb11de: Nuclear waste?
0xb11f7: They were extremely careless with their handling of nuclear materials. Nastasha knows all about that if you want more info.
0xb12a5: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb130d: Snake, re-input the PAL codes.
0xb1348: Snake, the surveillance camera... When you insert the card key, don't let it see you.
0xb13cd: Try using your Chaff.
0xb1416: You could probably use a Box too.
0xb1472: Snake, what are you doing? Go after Liquid!
0xb14d7: What the hell are you doing, Snake!? You've got to stop Metal Gear!
0xb1554: Snake, we don't need a rat trap. We need someone to stop that godamn nuke from getting launched!
0xb1618: Snake, is killing rats really that fun? Torturing small animals is a sign of a warped mind, you know.
0xb16b4: Snake, we don't need a rat trap. We need someone to stop that godamn nuke from getting launched!
0xb173a: CAMPBELL
0xb1772: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xb179f: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xb1819: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xb1880: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xb18eb: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xb194e: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xb19d3: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xb1a50: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xb1af2: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xb1b7b: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xb1bf8: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xb1cb0: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xb1ce7: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xb1d0c: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xb1dab: Are you smoking?
0xb1dda: Yeah, so what?
0xb1df9: Yeah, so what?
0xb1e14: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xb1e7f: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xb1eef: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xb1f51: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xb1feb: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xb205e: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xb210f: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xb214d: Diazepam?
0xb2161: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xb2204: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xb2240: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xb22c0: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xb2326: I see.
0xb2337: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xb23bc: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xb2439: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xb2478: I am a scientist.
0xb24d6: Snake, look at your C-rations. They're frozen. You can't use frozen C-rats.
0xb2543: Until they defrost, you won't be able to replenish your energy. Be very careful.
0xb25b8: They'll defrost in a warm place. Probably just your bare skin would be fine.
0xb2656: Snake, Naomi wants to talk to you.
0xb2697: How do you feel, Snake?
0xb26b9: Well, to tell you the truth, I think I'm catching a cold...
0xb2702: I'm monitoring you via the nanomachines...Your body temperature is elevated and your lymph nodes are slightly swollen.
0xb278c: But don't worry, it appears to be just a mild rhinovirus.
0xb27d3: I guess I got it from that soldier.
0xb2801: I've increased your nutrition and elevated your blood sugar level.
0xb2851: You can't cure it?
0xb286e: Sorry, Snake. The nanomachines don't carry antibiotics.
0xb28b6: Maybe you could find some garlic. It contains natural antibiotics, you know. Vitamins and minerals too.
0xb292e: Uhhh. Raw garlic. Gimme a break.
0xb2995: There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base. That would make you feel better.
0xb29fe: If not, you'll just have to wait until your body's natural defenses take over.
0xb2ad1: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xb2b48: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xb2b92: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xb2c35: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xb2c84: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xb2d18: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xb2da2: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xb2e56: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb2f40: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xb2fa6: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xb3073: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xb310d: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xb3185: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xb322c: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xb32bc: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xb3300: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xb3394: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xb3433: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xb34c9: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xb3526: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xb35a4: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xb3619: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xb3686: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xb3708: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xb374f: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xb37f8: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xb3889: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xb38f1: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xb3938: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xb39b1: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xb3a01: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xb3a78: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xb3b15: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xb3bbd: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xb3c41: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xb3c90: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xb3da6: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xb3e37: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xb3ea5: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xb3f04: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xb3f80: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xb4007: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xb408c: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xb415e: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xb41cc: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xb4232: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xb42ae: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xb433c: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xb43e1: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xb4487: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xb452e: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xb45d6: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xb4639: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xb46e3: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xb4771: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xb47da: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xb4876: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xb48d6: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xb4939: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xb49f6: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xb4a84: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xb4aed: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xb4ba7: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xb4c46: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xb4cf0: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xb4d6e: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xb4db4: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xb4df6: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xb4e43: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xb4e77: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xb4ee1: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xb4fb8: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xb500f: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xb5082: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xb50e4: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xb518e: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xb5230: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xb529c: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xb535d: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xb5415: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xb54c0: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xb5568: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xb5682: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xb5713: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xb5781: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xb57e0: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xb585c: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xb58e3: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xb5968: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xb5a3a: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xb5aa8: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xb5b0e: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xb5b8a: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xb5c18: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xb5cb2: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xb5d89: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xb5de0: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xb5e53: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xb5eb5: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xb5f54: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xb5fb1: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xb602f: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.

0xb67f3: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xb6856: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xb6913: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xb69a1: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xb6a0a: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.

0xb7448: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xb74f5: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xb75a0: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xb7648: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xb771c: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xb77b5: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xb7841: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xb78aa: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xb7955: You better use that weapon you found!
0xb7997: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xb7a2a: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xb7ad8: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xb7b64: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xb7bd9: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xb7c59: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xb7cee: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xb7d9b: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xb7e1d: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xb7eec: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xb7fa2: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xb801b: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xb80b7: ...I didn't know.
0xb80d3: Really?
0xb80ef: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xb8165: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xb8211: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xb8279: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xb8315: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xb837f: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xb83da: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xb8458: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xb84a6: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xb8529: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xb8649: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xb8678: Thank God...
0xb86a3: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xb86e4: She's got plenty of heart.
0xb871d: Thanks, Snake.
0xb8736: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xb879d: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xb888a: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xb88d8: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xb8985: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xb8a1d: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xb8a61: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xb8a9c: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xb8ae9: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xb8bb4: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xb8c1d: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xb8cad: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xb8cf9: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xb8d69: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xb8e59: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xb8ea5: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xb8f38: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb8f6f: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xb903b: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb9084: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xb915e: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xb91ac: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xb9259: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xb92f1: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xb9335: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xb9370: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xb93bd: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xb9491: For the time being, let's trust what that Deepthroat told us.
0xb94dc: Use a Remote Controlled Missile to destroy the switchboard in the NorthWest section of the Warhead Storage Building's 2nd floor basement.
0xb9599: Make sure your Remote Controlled Missile doesn't get shot down by those gun cameras. 
0xb965a: You did it. You destroyed the switchboard. The electrical current running through the floor should be off now.
0xb96fa: You've got to rescue Dr. Emmerich and find out Metal Gear's weak point.
0xb9763: Isn't he being held in the laboratory in the northeast part of the floor you're on?
0xb97d9: Snake, you've got to rescue Dr. Emmerich, the Metal Gear engineer.
0xb983d: He's probably being held prisoner in the 2nd floor basement of the Warhead Storage Building.
0xb98e3: Snake, don't fire your weapon  on that floor.
0xb993e: I've already programmed the nanomachines so that he won't be able to, Colonel.
0xb99a7: What! What are you talking about!?
0xb99de: Have you forgotten? That's where they keep the nuclear warheads. Can't you see them?
0xb9a4d: Yeah. There's lots of boxes piled up here, but...are they all warheads?
0xb9ab6: Yes. They're all dismantled warheads.
0xb9af0: They just leave them here? It's like President Baker said...totally careless.
0xb9b4e: They're working on a limited budget. They try to put on a pretty face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.
0xb9bd7: Nastasha knows lots more about it than I do. 
0xb9c3b: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xb9c80: All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation mechanisms removed so there's no fear of them exploding.
0xb9d09: But if the warheads are broken, they might leak plutonium and that would be a serious problem.
0xb9dc8: Snake, never use your weapon  on that floor.
0xb9e61: The ninja!...
0xb9e83: Huh?
0xb9ea6: What?
0xb9eb6: That stealth camouflage, it's him.  It must be!
0xb9ef3: Snake! Emmerich's in danger!  Hurry and go after him!
0xb9f58: Snake! Hurry! Emmerich's in danger!
0xb9fc3: If you have a question about members of FOX-HOUND, you should ask Naomi.
0xba02d: I'm sorry, but there's no one in  FOX-HOUND like that.
0xba071: There are currently only six members of FOX-HOUND.
0xba0b1: Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf,  Vulcan Raven, Decoy Octopus,  Revolver Ocelot...
0xba10f: And finally Liquid Snake.
0xba133: The Genome soldiers under his command are Next Generation Special Forces.
0xba18d: FOX-HOUND is intended to be  a small number of highly elite, hand-picked soldiers.
0xba1f0: You're talking about the current  FOX-HOUND, right?
0xba231: Yes...
0xba256: Snake, who or what is that thing?  Is he an enemy or not?
0xba29d: That's what I'd like to know. Naomi, you really don't have any idea?
0xba317: ...Maybe I should ask you the same thing.
0xba34e: What?
0xba35e: Nothing...forget about it.
0xba3b1: Snake, he's obviously trying to provoke you.
0xba410: Snake, he's obviously trying to provoke you. Throw away your weapon and take him on.
0xba493: It looks like your weapons won't work on him. You'll have to think of something else.
0xba50c: He's fast! If you lose sight of him, switch to First Person View Mode and look for him.
0xba5e7: Well it looks like you've rescued Emmerich for the time being.
0xba633: Yeah. With that stealth camouflage, he should be able to hide safely.
0xba686: Gray Fox...I can't believe it...But the real problem is your niece. The way the Codec got cut off like that has me worried.
0xba715: Something must have happened to her...
0xba75d: You're worried? About Meryl?
0xba784: Not exactly. It's just that she's holding the detonation code override keys. They're our last chance of stopping that nuclear launch.
0xba827: You're a cold man. Your mission is more important than the life of your companions?
0xba88b: This is war. Survival is the name of the game. Sometimes you have to be cold to survive.
0xba8f4: Yes, but...
0xba91e: Snake, either way I want you to find Meryl as soon as possible.
0xba96b: I understand.
0xbaa22: You didn't find Meryl? Why don't you take another look around?
0xbaa8d: So Meryl's disguised as an enemy soldier, huh? Well even so, you should be able to spot her if you look close enough.
0xbab16: Use either First Person View or Corner View Mode to get a really close look.
0xbaba3: You might also try to sneak in by covering yourself with that cardboard box.
0xbac14: Didn't Meryl say that she's somewhere close by? Why don't you start by searching in that building.
0xbac9b: Meryl said that she's close by. She's probably in the Warhead Storage Building? Why don't you start by looking there.
0xbad6d: Colonel, your niece is fine.
0xbad94: Thank goodness!
0xbadae: We can't relax...not yet.
0xbadd2: I know. Snake...
0xbaded: She is quite a woman.
0xbae0d: As commander of this operation,  I can't ask you to watch after Meryl, but...
0xbae6b: Duty first?
0xbae81: Maybe I was wrong...sending my own flesh and blood to war.
0xbaec9: She understands about duty.
0xbaeef: I know she does...
0xbaf0c: But what I want to know is what was the real purpose of this military exercise?
0xbaf6c: I don't know. Like I said, I'm nothing more than a middleman.
0xbafb7: Is this transmission being monitored by the military?
0xbaffa: Of course.
0xbb00f: I get it. All the world's a stage and we're merely players, right?
0xbb05f: Yes, but even players can influence the play.
0xbb09a: I just hope we can prevent it from having a bad ending.
0xbb101: Snake, go with Meryl to the underground base where they're keeping Metal Gear.
0xbb1a7: Colonel, Meryl's acting kind of strange.
0xbb1da: Maybe she's just feeling a little tired from all the stress.
0xbb238: Snake, do you hear something that sounds like a song?
0xbb27b: Yeah, I do. I started hearing it a little way back. What could it be?
0xbb30a: Hurry ahead, Snake. The underground base is to the north, isn't it?
0xbb396: Snake, Meryl's not herself.  Don't use your weapon.
0xbb3eb: It's Psycho Mantis. He's controlling Meryl. That tune is his mind control music.
0xbb476: Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.
0xbb4e9: I can't see Mantis!
0xbb51b: Snake, he has mind powers,  but he's not a magician. 
0xbb55e: I get it. Stealth camouflage maybe?
0xbb5a0: Meryl is being controlled by him.
0xbb5d8: Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.
0xbb63b: My First Person View Mode isn't working right.
0xbb677: You're seeing what he's seeing. It's a result of his telepathic powers. Maybe you can use that to find him!
0xbb705: Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.
0xbb7be: That's Psycho Mantis...former KGB psychic. He has powerful telepathic abilities.
0xbb81f: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America looking for a job. He worked with the FBI on several cases as a psychic profiler.
0xbb8bf: Five years ago he was working on the case of a multiple serial murderer ...and he got too far into the killer's mind.
0xbb948: As a result, he became just like the killer.
0xbb996: So he was sort of infected by this serial murderer's thoughts...?
0xbb9f9: In any case, after that he became sort of a psychic spy working for the highest bidder. He travelled all around the world.
0xbba87: That's when he was recruited by FOX-HOUND.
0xbbacb: He can read people's minds. He knows every move that you're going to make. 
0xbbb27: What should I do? I've got no chance of beating him.
0xbbb7d: There must be some way.
0xbbbb3: He's a master at controlling people. Snake! Don't let him manipulate you!
0xbbc28: Not everything you see with your two eyes is real. Destroying his spirit is more important than destroying his body.
0xbbcc4: Don't let him read you. Be a blank slate! Okay? Clear your mind.
0xbbd30: He read your mind with his psychic abilities. Somehow you've got to get around him!
0xbbdd1: I've got it. Use the Controller port!!
0xbbe02: Plug your Controller into Controller port 2. If you do that he won't be able to read your mind!
0xbbece: Snake, is there some reason you can't use Controller port 2?
0xbbf18: Oh well, it's okay. Do you see something that looks like a statue on both sides of the room?
0xbbf85: Yeah. You mean those things with their faces all wrapped up in leather bands?
0xbbfe3: Yes. Attack those statues to uncover their faces.
0xbc022: Why?
0xbc045: Those statues were modeled after Mantis' real face.
0xbc086: Mantis despises the sight of his own face. If he suddenly sees his own disfigured face staring at him, it might break his concentration.
0xbc15e: Snake, if you destroy the faces of those statues, you should be able to disturb Mantis' psychic powers.
0xbc1ea: He's using his psychic ability to read your Controller's moves. That's how he's evading your attack.
0xbc25f: You've got to do something so he can't read your Controller's moves. Think! There must be some way!
0xbc2ea: CAMPBELL
0xbc322: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xbc34f: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xbc3c9: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xbc430: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xbc49b: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xbc4fe: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xbc583: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xbc600: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xbc6a2: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xbc72b: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xbc7a8: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xbc860: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xbc897: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xbc8bc: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xbc95b: Are you smoking?
0xbc98a: Yeah, so what?
0xbc9a9: Yeah, so what?
0xbc9c4: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xbca2f: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xbca9f: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xbcb01: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xbcb9b: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xbcc0e: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xbccbf: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xbccfd: Diazepam?
0xbcd11: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xbcdb4: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xbcdf0: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xbce70: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xbced6: I see.
0xbcee7: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xbcf6c: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xbcfe9: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xbd028: I am a scientist.
0xbd086: Snake, look at your C-rations. They're frozen. You can't use frozen C-rats.
0xbd0f3: Until they defrost, you won't be able to replenish your energy. Be very careful.
0xbd168: They'll defrost in a warm place. Probably just your bare skin would be fine.
0xbd206: Snake, Naomi wants to talk to you.
0xbd247: How do you feel, Snake?
0xbd269: Well, to tell you the truth, I think I'm catching a cold...
0xbd2b2: I'm monitoring you via the nanomachines...Your body temperature is elevated and your lymph nodes are slightly swollen.
0xbd33c: But don't worry, it appears to be just a mild rhinovirus.
0xbd383: I guess I got it from that soldier.
0xbd3b1: I've increased your nutrition and elevated your blood sugar level.
0xbd401: You can't cure it?
0xbd41e: Sorry, Snake. The nanomachines don't carry antibiotics.
0xbd466: Maybe you could find some garlic. It contains natural antibiotics, you know. Vitamins and minerals too.
0xbd4de: Uhhh. Raw garlic. Gimme a break.
0xbd545: There must be some cold medicine somewhere on the base. That would make you feel better.
0xbd5ae: If not, you'll just have to wait until your body's natural defenses take over.
0xbd646: Be careful. Wolves have the advantage in the dark. Not only can they see better, but they have a keen sense of smell as well.
0xbd6d7: You'd better use your Night-Vision Goggles.
0xbd72f: Ask Dr. Emmerich where the Night-Vision Goggles are.
0xbd7a2: It looks like Meryl's okay. Thanks, Snake.
0xbd7ee: ..........
0xbd8fa: Snake, isn't Meryl waiting for you?
0xbd93c: It's rude to keep a lady waiting.
0xbd98f: Colonel, I lost track of Meryl...
0xbd9bb: If I know Meryl, she's probably waiting for you up ahead somewhere.
0xbda34: To get to the underground base, you've got to go through that cave and use the passageway that leads to the Communications Tower.
0xbdaf3: Snake, there's no time left. You've got to hurry up and get to the underground base.
0xbdb6a: Snake, there's no time left. You've got to hurry up and get to the underground base.
0xbdbcf: You should be able to go north from the Commander's Room.
0xbdc6b: Sniper Wolf is Fox Hound's best sharpshooter.
0xbdca6: Everyone knows that women have more patience than men,
0xbdcea: but Sniper Wolf can go for a whole week with no sleep, no food...her sights never straying from her target.
0xbdd66: And on top of that, she takes diazepam, so that her hands never tremble.
0xbde07: Stay out of her range and shoot at her with a sniper rifle. 
0xbde70: Yeah, but where can I find a sniper rifle? I can't ask Meryl.
0xbdecf: What about Dr. Emmerich? He's been on the base for a while. He might know...
0xbdf4a: 7 OTACON
0xbdf80: Ask Dr. Emmerich where there might be a sniper rifle.
0xbdfd7: Didn't you just hear that there's a sniper rifle in the 2nd floor basement of the Tank Hangar!? Go get it and save Meryl!
0xbe08b: You got a PSG-1? You can use that against Sniper Wolf. Hurry up and save Meryl!
0xbe10d: Stay out of her range and shoot back with a sniper rifle.
0xbe195: Good job with Wolf. Is Meryl okay?
0xbe1c2: I don't know. I don't see her around.
0xbe21a: You don't think she's been captured do you!?
0xbe254: Could be. Let's ask Wolf. If she's still alive, I'm going to get some answers...
0xbe2b2: Snake...
0xbe2d9: About Meryl, I'm counting on you.
0xbe327: Snake, take the underground passage north.
0xbe3cd: Snake, the launch deadline for the new nuclear warhead is almost here. Hurry and get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base!
0xbe463: The overland route is blocked by a glacier. Climb the Communications Tower so you can go over it.
0xbe4f3: The Communications Tower consists of tower A and tower B. You're in tower A now. To get to tower B, you'll have to use the outside walkway.
0xbe5a6: Remember, Snake. Dark places are dangerous places.
0xbe5e6: You can't see where your enemies are coming from. Please use your Night-Vision Goggles or your Thermal Goggles.
0xbe69d: The walkway door won't open, huh?
0xbe6e8: Yeah. Any ideas?
0xbe703: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich.
0xbe751: Wait a minute, Snake. According to these satellite photos that Mei Ling got, it looks as if there's a walkway on the roof as well.
0xbe7fb: You can take that to the other side too.
0xbe842: Be careful, Snake.
0xbe88d: Snake, you'll have to use the walkway on the roof. Climb up there!
0xbe8fc: That's easy for you to say...
0xbe949: Use your throw move on the bad guys that are chasing you!
0xbe9af: Grenades might work well too. To get the grenade to explode near the soldiers, pull the pin and hold on to it for 4 seconds before you throw it.
0xbea9e: Snake, wait a minute. You forgot to take your items.
0xbeaf4: They're probably being kept somewhere close by.
0xbeb43: To get to the underground base where Metal Gear is, you'll have to climb the Communications Tower on the north side of the cave.
0xbec0b: Wait a minute, Snake. You're in an armory. Why don't you load up on ammo?
0xbecc4: Whew...I made it to the roof.
0xbecec: You must be exhausted, Snake.
0xbed14: It was no big deal.
0xbed32: Snake, I'm monitoring you closely. Your heart rate is elevated and your breathing is shallow.
0xbeda0: ..........
0xbedc9: What's the matter, Snake? You out of shape from all that dog mushing?
0xbee54: The walkway should be right in front of you. Cross it to get to tower B.
0xbeeb8: Then climb down and proceed north.
0xbef04: Where are you going, Snake? Hurry and take the walkway on the roof to the B tower.
0xbefaa: Snake, wait a minute. You forgot to take your items.
0xbf000: They're probably being kept somewhere close by.
0xbf04f: To get to the underground base where Metal Gear is, you'll have to climb the Communications Tower on the north side of the cave.
0xbf117: Wait a minute, Snake. You're in an armory. Why don't you load up on ammo?
0xbf1b2: The walkway on the roof of tower A was destroyed...? That doesn't mean there's no other way.
0xbf253: Is there a rope or something around there? If you had a rope you could rappel from the roof of tower A down to the walkway below.
0xbf2e8: You're an expert at rappelling aren't you?
0xbf332: You'll have to go to the north part of tower A and use that rope to rappel down to the walkway below.
0xbf3db: It's too dangerous! That Hind is aiming at Snake! And he'll need to use both hands to rappel too!
0xbf461: You're right, but we have no choice! The Hind can't move in tight spaces. It's our best bet!
0xbf4e2: This is insane!
0xbf4fc: The colonel's right. There's no other way.
0xbf570: Here's how to rappel.
0xbf590: Press the X button to jump away from the wall. While you're away from the wall, press down on the Directional Button to drop down.
0xbf626: If you jump while pressing right or left on the Directional Button, you can make a big jump in that direction.
0xbf6a5: If you press and hold the O Button while using the Directional Button, you can walk slowly across the wall.
0xbf721: If you're careful with the timing, you should be able to dodge the gunfire from the Hind while you rappel down. If anyone can do it, you can Snake!
0xbf839: Snake, the Hind is still circling above the Communications Tower.
0xbf888: Damn. There's no weapon here that I can use to take him on.
0xbf8ef: Dr. Emmerich might know where there's a weapon you could use against the Hind. Why don't you ask him.
0xbf97a: Snake, hurry up and get those Stinger Missiles. Didn't Emmerich say they're near the entrance to the walkway in tower B?
0xbfa40: The way to the top is blocked, huh...Well we can worry about that later. Why don't you go and see what's happening below?
0xbfaf2: It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you. I'm looking at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.
0xbfba1: Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just circling around like a buzzard.
0xbfbf5: I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast?
0xbfc45: Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do something to help.
0xbfc99: Snake...I don't like it.  Please don't go up to the roof.
0xbfce0: I have to. I can't run from this one.
0xbfd46: Liquid is waiting for you up on the roof...
0xbfd91: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0xbfdeb: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0xbfe36: The staircase is broken...tough luck. It looks like the elevator is the only way up now. Okay, Snake, I want you to head up there right away.
0xbff14: It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you. I'm looking at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.
0xbffc3: Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just circling around like a buzzard.
0xc0017: I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast?
0xc0067: Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do something to help.
0xc00bb: Snake...I don't like it.  Please don't go up to the roof.
0xc0102: I have to. I can't run from this one.
0xc0168: Liquid is waiting for you up on the roof...
0xc01b3: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0xc020d: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0xc027f: Liquid means to bring this to an end now. He obviously planned this.
0xc02e5: Maybe the broken elevator was all part of the trap.
0xc0326: You mean he fiddled with the elevator to get me out on the roof?
0xc03b3: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0xc042e: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0xc04cb: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0xc051e: Use your ears, Snake. You should be able to tell where he's coming from by the sound of his rotor blades.
0xc05d0: Huh? Snake, you're not using a stereo TV!?
0xc0626: It can't be!
0xc0665: A Mono TV...
0xc0690: Hmmmmmm....
0xc06ba: Well Colonel...there's nothing we can do about it...
0xc0710: ...I guess you're right.
0xc0733: Snake, don't worry about it. There's more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. You can do it just the way you are!
0xc07e5: A mono TV...
0xc084b: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0xc08e8: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0xc094e: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0xc09eb: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0xc0a33: Use your ears, Snake. You should be able to tell where he's coming from by the sound of his rotor blades.
0xc0ae5: Huh? Snake, you're not using a stereo TV!?
0xc0b3b: It can't be!
0xc0b7a: A Mono TV...
0xc0ba5: Hmmmmmm....
0xc0bcf: Well Colonel...there's nothing we can do about it...
0xc0c25: ...I guess you're right.
0xc0c48: Snake, don't worry about it. There's more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. You can do it just the way you are!
0xc0cfa: A mono TV...
0xc0d7c: You did it, Snake! You shot down the Hind! 
0xc0dc9: I was so worried...
0xc0dfb: Liquid couldn't have survived that.
0xc0e29: I wonder...
0xc0e3f: But even so, just cause we've taken out their leader doesn't mean they're going to give up. They're still going to try to launch that nuke.
0xc0ede: You're right. There's no time to waste.
0xc0f31: Hurry. The underground base is past the Communications Tower. The elevator is working again, isn't it?
0xc100a: They're using stealth camouflage!  You can't see them, so listen closely. Use your ears.
0xc1087: How does that stealth technology work?
0xc10bb: Is it optic or chemical? ...Do you know, Snake?
0xc1134: Ask the person who invented it. He should know.
0xc1196: Snake, you can't fight what you can't see. Use your Thermal Goggles!
0xc11fa: Snake, use all five of your senses. You can do it even without Thermal Goggles!
0xc1293: You did it, Snake! You shot down the Hind! 
0xc12e0: I was so worried...
0xc1312: Liquid couldn't have survived that.
0xc1340: I wonder...
0xc1356: But even so, just cause we've taken out their leader doesn't mean they're going to give up. They're still going to try to launch that nuke.
0xc13f5: You're right. There's no time to waste.
0xc1448: Hurry. The underground base is past the Communications Tower. The elevator is working again, isn't it?
0xc1510: It looks like the weather is getting worse. Try using your Binoculars.
0xc1564: What about the satellite data?
0xc15a1: I'm sorry, Snake. I can't see the entrance in the satellite photos either.
0xc15f9: What about a heat source? An exhaust pipe or something?
0xc163e: I can't confirm anything. Only that there are multiple heat sources to the southeast of your position.
0xc16c9: That's probably just the burning wreckage from the Hind.
0xc1723: Snake, you're in a big open space surrounded by walls. The entrance to the underground base should be somewhere in there.
0xc17b0: Stay close to the walls and you won't get lost.
0xc1829: Snake, you're our only hope. Please stop them from launching that nuke.
0xc1893: The entrance to the underground maintenance base is somewhere towards the back of the Snowfield north of Tower B.
0xc1969: It's Sniper Wolf. You can only shoot at her with your PSG-1.
0xc19dd: Snake, Wolf is hiding somewhere in that Snowfield. First you'll have to find out where she is.
0xc1a76: She should come out of hiding briefly to shoot at you.
0xc1ae8: Snake, Wolf is hiding somewhere in that Snowfield. First you'll have to find out where she is.
0xc1b6a: She should come out of hiding briefly to shoot at you.
0xc1be2: It looks like Wolf is down. Now get to Metal Gear's underground base on the double.
0xc1ca5: Colonel, there's an elevator, but it's stuck on a floor below.
0xc1cf1: That elevator can probably only be moved from below.
0xc1d33: There must be some other way down. Look around.
0xc1da3: Dr. Emmerich knows the base well. Why don't you ask him?
0xc1e10: Snake, that's a blast furnace.
0xc1e39: A blast furnace? What do they use that for?
0xc1e72: There's no airport on the base,  so it's hard to bring in supplies.
0xc1ec3: They must have built a blast furnace so they could make building materials and such.
0xc1f28: That makes sense. Whew, I'm starting to sweat. It's getting kind of warm.
0xc1fb3: The entrance to the underground base is further below.
0xc1ff7: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there. Try to find it.
0xc2079: The elevator to the underground base was in the northeast of the bottom floor. Right, Snake?
0xc2109: Metal Gear is straight down. Better move it!
0xc2162: There's no time.  The terrorists are ready to launch.
0xc21a5: Negotiations are all finished?
0xc21ce: The government can't cave in to terrorist's demands.
0xc2210: But they're threatening to launch a nuclear weapon!
0xc2251: They've made their final decision.
0xc227e: ...Why is the White House being so inflexible?
0xc22ba: ..........
0xc22cf: Colonel, is there still something you're hiding from me?
0xc2315: Snake, please...just concentrate on stopping them, okay?
0xc239c: A sad story. We shouldn't have turned our backs on the Kurds after the Gulf War...
0xc23ff: Listen. We're not responsible for her choices. Everyone decides their own fate, no matter where they were born.
0xc247f: Words like fate, karma...it's just an excuse for giving up if you ask me....
0xc24ed: I don't agree with you.
0xc250f: Maybe if she hadn't been born on a battlefield, she might have had a happier, more fulfilling life. She might not have turned into a killer...
0xc25b1: ..........
0xc25e8: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base! The entrance should be towards the back of the Snowfield.
0xc26a5: Snake, blow away all the bad guys or you're not going to be able to get out of there and get to the underground base.
0xc278d: Colonel, there's an elevator, but it's stuck on a floor below.
0xc27d9: That elevator can probably only be moved from below.
0xc281b: There must be some other way down. Look around.
0xc288b: Dr. Emmerich knows the base well. Why don't you ask him?
0xc28f8: Snake, that's a blast furnace.
0xc2921: A blast furnace? What do they use that for?
0xc295a: There's no airport on the base,  so it's hard to bring in supplies.
0xc29ab: They must have built a blast furnace so they could make building materials and such.
0xc2a10: That makes sense. Whew, I'm starting to sweat. It's getting kind of warm.
0xc2a9b: The entrance to the underground base is further below.
0xc2adf: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there. Try to find it.
0xc2b61: The elevator to the underground base was in the northeast of the bottom floor. Right, Snake?
0xc2bf1: Metal Gear is straight down. Better move it!
0xc2c4a: There's no time.  The terrorists are ready to launch.
0xc2c8d: Negotiations are all finished?
0xc2cb6: The government can't cave in to terrorist's demands.
0xc2cf8: But they're threatening to launch a nuclear weapon!
0xc2d39: They've made their final decision.
0xc2d66: ...Why is the White House being so inflexible?
0xc2da2: ..........
0xc2db7: Colonel, is there still something you're hiding from me?
0xc2dfd: Snake, please...just concentrate on stopping them, okay?
0xc2e84: A sad story. We shouldn't have turned our backs on the Kurds after the Gulf War...
0xc2ee7: Listen. We're not responsible for her choices. Everyone decides their own fate, no matter where they were born.
0xc2f67: Words like fate, karma...it's just an excuse for giving up if you ask me....
0xc2fd5: I don't agree with you.
0xc2ff7: Maybe if she hadn't been born on a battlefield, she might have had a happier, more fulfilling life. She might not have turned into a killer...
0xc3099: ..........
0xc30d0: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base! The entrance should be towards the back of the Snowfield.
0xc31a0: Colonel, where's Naomi?
0xc31d6: I'm right here, Snake. What is it?
0xc3203: Oh...uh...nothing. Forget it.
0xc322b: Strange...
0xc327c: ...Snake, by now those terrorists have finished their launch preparations. Stop wasting time!
0xc3325: Vulcan Raven is half Native Alaskan American and half Inuit. He was raised as a shaman and they say he has supernatural powers.
0xc33b8: During the Cold War, he trained in Russia with the Bimpel, the Soviet special forces. 
0xc341f: In 1993, he was demoted by President Yeltsin following his coup d'etat. So he fled the country and became a mercenary.
0xc34a9: After that, he joined those rent-a-war bastards at "Outer Heaven Inc."
0xc34ff: He stayed there until he joined us in Fox Hound, thanks to a strong recommendation from Revolver Ocelot.
0xc358c: That cannon he's holding is a 20 millimeter Vulcan gun. You usually see them mounted on fighter planes.
0xc3604: You can't take him on in a fire fight. He'll make mincemeat of you.
0xc3669: He's not just strong, Snake. He's a graduate emeritus from Alaska University, so he's a quick thinker, too.
0xc36f9: In any case, you'd better not try to attack him from the front.
0xc3746: Normal weapons are no match for his 20 millimeter Vulcan. Try to attack him from the sides or behind.
0xc37ea: You're at a disadvantage in a frontal assault.
0xc3826: Try attacking him with a Remote-Controlled Missile. Maneuver it between the containers to get it to come up behind him.
0xc38b1: But if you fly the missiles too slow, they'll get shot down even if they approach him from behind.
0xc3924: Try to get them close by flying them at top speed, or by maneuvering them around corners.
0xc39a1: You could also try to predict where he's gonna move and set up some C-4. If your timing is good, it might work.
0xc3a37: When the containers get destroyed, they'll block your way. Try to take him out before that happens.
0xc3af4: Snake, if it's about Naomi, I'm looking into the matter right now. Give me a little more time.
0xc3b63: Where is she?
0xc3b7b: She's still sleeping.
0xc3b9b: I can't believe it... First, the DARPA Chief turns out to be an imposter and now Naomi...What the hell is going on here?
0xc3c27: I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know anything, right?
0xc3c76: I'm sorry, Snake.
0xc3c92: A madman is threatening the world with a nuclear weapon. I guess that's what I should worry about now...
0xc3d63: Snake, stop that launch. Head for the Control Room in the underground base.
0xc3deb: Give Dr. Emmerich a call.
0xc3e21: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the underground base, isn't it?
0xc3e84: There's no time!
0xc3ecd: Snake, stop that launch. Head for the Control Room in the underground base.
0xc3f56: Give Dr. Emmerich a call.
0xc3f8c: The Control Room is on the 3rd floor of the underground base, isn't it?
0xc3ff9: Snake, hurry up and get to Metal Gear's underground base. It's north of the warehouse where you fought Raven.
0xc40de: Snake, get that card key back from the rat. Why don't you watch its route and set up a trap for it with the C4 or something.
0xc4180: Find that key! It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch!
0xc41fa: Use your Mine Detector.
0xc423b: Mine Detector?
0xc4254: Yes. The Mine Detector works just like a metal detector. The position of the card key should show up on your radar screen.
0xc430a: Snake, they've input both detonation codes. The only way to stop the launch now is to use the card key to re-input the codes.
0xc43a7: Find that card key! It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch!
0xc441c: You got the card key...good. Now get back to the Control Room and use that key to re-input the PAL codes. Stop that launch!
0xc44bd: Snake, the card key changed shape. That's no good. Change it back.
0xc454c: Good. The card key changed shape. Hurry up to the control room, Snake!
0xc45ce: Snake, don't warm that card key. Cool it down. Find someplace cool.
0xc464e: Snake, look at the card key. It changed to its original shape. You'll have to change it again.
0xc46ef: You've got to lower that card key's temperature. Find someplace cold!
0xc4795: Colonel, what's new with Naomi?
0xc47bf: She's being interrogated, Snake. Leave her to me. You just worry about stopping Metal Gear.
0xc482b: ..........
0xc4840: Please, Snake.
0xc4859: I consider you my friend. Please believe that.
0xc4895: ..........
0xc48c9: Snake, we're just about out of time! Get to the Control Room!
0xc494e: Snake, what are you doing? You're supposed to warm it, not cool it. Look for a warm place.
0xc49d7: You did it. That's the last one! Hurry to the Control Room!
0xc4a55: Snake, look at the card key. It changed to its original shape. You'll have to change it again.
0xc4ae6: Now you've got to warm the key up. Find someplace hot!
0xc4b5d: What about Naomi?
0xc4b79: Sorry, Snake...I'm still investigating.
0xc4c06: Snake, gas! Do something!
0xc4c36: Snake! Call Emmerich! He should be able to break through security!
0xc4c98: Snake, Emmerich will be able to open the door. Just trust him and hang on!
0xc4d1a: Snake, what are you doing? Go after Liquid!
0xc4d8f: God help us! Metal Gear is moving...
0xc4dbe: Snake, it's all riding on you now. You've got to stop that thing!
0xc4e0d: But how?
0xc4e20: You'll have to ask Dr. Emmerich, the guy who made it.
0xc4e75: Destroy Metal Gear! We're out of time!
0xc4ec5: If you can't do it, I'll have to resort to my last option.
0xc4f0d: Last option?
0xc4f24: We have a submarine prepared to deliver a full nuclear strike on the base.
0xc4f89: What the hell!?
0xc4ffe: Colonel, Fox is dead...
0xc502a: I know.....God rest his soul.
0xc5052: Even a soldier needs more to live for than just fighting. Maybe if he had found something else, he wouldn't have been so haunted...
0xc50e9: He was too simple...too pure. There was nothing in this world for him to believe in...so he chose to believe only in himself.
0xc5184: I guess you're right. A man like Fox is really only looking for his death...
0xc51e1: Yeah. But if you ask me, there's no happiness to be gained in death... no peace either.
0xc5249: I'm gonna leave here alive.
0xc526f: Good. I want that too.
0xc52b2: If you can shoot a Stinger missile directly into the cockpit, maybe you can destroy it. C'mon, Snake! Win!
0xc53d0: Snake, wait a minute. You forgot to take your items.
0xc5426: They're probably being kept somewhere close by.
0xc5475: To get to the underground base where Metal Gear is, you'll have to climb the Communications Tower on the north side of the cave.
0xc553d: Wait a minute, Snake. You're in an armory. Why don't you load up on ammo?
0xc55ec: Snake, great job! You stopped Metal Gear...
0xc5625: No...it's not time to celebrate yet. I can't move.
0xc568d: Snake, can you turn your neck? Take a look around.
0xc583e: Snake, you have to crawl to get through there.
0xc587a: First crouch down by pressing the Crawl Button and then use the Directional button to crawl in the direction you want.
0xc5937: Be careful though. Crawling is slow and you can't attack when you're doing it either.
0xc59b1: You can stand up by pressing the Crawl Button again.
0xc5a4a: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xc5af2: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xc5b55: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xc5bff: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xc5c8d: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xc5cf6: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xc5d92: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xc5df2: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xc5e55: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xc5f12: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xc5fa0: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xc6009: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xc60c7: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xc616d: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xc6212: Snake, there's an elevator there you can take up to the ground.
0xc6290: You'll just have to wait for the elevator to come down. You'd better hide somewhere.
0xc6307: Get on the elevator. It should take you right to the front of the Nuclear Weapon Disposal Facility. Be careful, though.
0xc63c0: Snake, don't run over puddles. The splashing sound might alert your enemies. Be careful.
0xc6472: Are you smoking?
0xc64a1: Yeah, so what?
0xc64c0: Yeah, so what?
0xc64db: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xc6546: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xc65b6: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xc6618: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xc66b2: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xc6725: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xc67dc: Snake, don't forget this is a covert operation. There are lots of bad guys and only one of you.
0xc684c: If you're spotted, you'll be surrounded before you know it.
0xc68b5: If that happens, you're finished.
0xc6901: First go to the elevator in the back and take it up to the ground floor. Then look for the DARPA Chief.
0xc69a7: Snake, don't forget this is a covert operation. There are lots of bad guys and only one of you.
0xc6a17: If you're spotted, you'll be surrounded before you know it.
0xc6a73: First go to the elevator in the back and take it up to the ground floor. Then look for the DARPA Chief.
0xc6b20: Snake, don't forget this is a covert operation. There are lots of bad guys and only one of you.
0xc6b90: If you're spotted, you'll be surrounded before you know it.
0xc6bf9: If that happens, you're finished.
0xc6c45: First go to the elevator in the back and take it up to the ground floor. Then look for the DARPA Chief.
0xc6ceb: Snake, don't forget this is a covert operation. There are lots of bad guys and only one of you.
0xc6d5b: If you're spotted, you'll be surrounded before you know it.
0xc6db7: First go to the elevator in the back and take it up to the ground floor. Then look for the DARPA Chief.
0xc6e79: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xc6ed6: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xc6f54: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xc6fc9: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xc7036: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xc70b8: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xc70ff: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xc71a8: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xc7239: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xc72a1: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xc72e8: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xc7361: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xc73b1: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xc7428: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xc74c5: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xc756d: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xc75f1: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xc7640: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xc7756: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xc77e7: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xc7855: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xc78b4: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xc7930: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xc79b7: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xc7a3c: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xc7b0e: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xc7b7c: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xc7be2: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xc7c5e: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xc7cec: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xc7d91: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xc7e37: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xc7ede: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xc7f86: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xc7fe9: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xc8093: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xc8121: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xc818a: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xc8226: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xc8286: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xc82e9: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xc83a6: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xc8434: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xc849d: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xc8557: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xc85f6: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xc86a0: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xc871e: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xc8764: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xc87a6: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xc87f3: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xc8827: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xc8891: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xc8968: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xc89bf: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xc8a32: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xc8a94: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xc8b3e: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xc8be0: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xc8c4c: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xc8d0d: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xc8dc5: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xc8e70: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xc8f18: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xc9032: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xc90c3: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xc9131: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xc9190: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xc920c: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xc9293: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xc9318: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xc93ea: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xc9458: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xc94be: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xc953a: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xc95c8: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xc9662: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xc9739: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xc9790: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xc9803: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xc9865: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xc9904: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xc9961: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xc99df: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xc9a54: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xc9ac1: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,

0xc9fb0: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xca03e: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xca0a7: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xca143: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xca1a3: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xca206: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xca2c3: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xca351: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xca3ba: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xca469: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xca508: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xca5b2: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xca630: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xca676: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xca6b8: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xca705: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xca739: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xca798: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xca800: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xca847: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xca8c0: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xca910: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xca987: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xcaa24: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xcaacc: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xcab50: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xcab9f: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xcac3f: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xcace1: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xcad42: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xcadf8: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xcaea5: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xcaf50: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xcaff8: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xcb136: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xcb1ad: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xcb1f7: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xcb29a: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xcb2e9: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xcb37d: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xcb407: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xcb4bb: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xcb571: Snake, they're using a searchlight to sweep the area. Make sure you stay out of the beam.
0xcb609: There's no turning back now, Snake. You've got a job to do and you're our only hope. The world is counting on you.
0xcb6d5: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xcb702: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xcb77c: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xcb7e3: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xcb84e: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xcb8b1: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xcb936: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xcb9b3: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xcba55: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xcbade: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xcbb5b: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xcbc59: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xcbcd0: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xcbd1a: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xcbdbd: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xcbe0c: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xcbea0: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xcbf2a: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xcbfde: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xcc094: It looks like a cargo truck.
0xcc0bb: They must use it for transporting goods around the base.
0xcc149: Snake, why don't you try to hide in the truck? If you disguise yourself as part of the cargo, you might be able to use the truck to get around.
0xcc22c: That base must have some kind of ventilation system to recirculate the air. There should be air ducts around there somewhere.
0xcc2dc: They must need a lot of power to run the base. There's probably a diesel generator somewhere.
0xcc34a: And since generating electricity requires oxygen, there must be exhaust openings for that too.
0xcc3e4: You're not going to believe this, but they shot down the F-16s we were using as a diversion....with a Hind D! Then we got a message from Liquid.
0xcc488: He said if we try something like that again, he'll launch the nuke!
0xcc4d9: Snake, hurry up and get in there! That Hind will be coming back soon.
0xcc56a: Snake, you'll never be able to get through the front door. Find some other way to get in.
0xcc61f: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xcc69f: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xcc74a: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xcc777: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xcc7f1: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xcc858: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xcc8c3: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xcc926: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xcc9ab: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xcca28: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xccaca: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xccb53: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xccbd0: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xccc88: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xcccbf: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xccce4: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xccd83: Are you smoking?
0xccdb2: Yeah, so what?
0xccdd1: Yeah, so what?
0xccdec: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xcce57: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xccec7: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xccf29: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xccfc3: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xcd036: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xcd0e7: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xcd125: Diazepam?
0xcd139: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xcd1dc: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xcd218: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xcd298: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xcd2fe: I see.
0xcd30f: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xcd394: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xcd411: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xcd450: I am a scientist.
0xcd511: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xcd588: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xcd5d2: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xcd675: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xcd6c4: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xcd758: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xcd7e2: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xcd896: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xcd976: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xcd9dc: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xcdaa9: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xcdb43: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xcdbbb: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xcdc62: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xcdcf2: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xcdd36: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xcddca: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xcde69: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xcdeff: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xcdf5c: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xcdfda: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xce04f: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xce0bc: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xce13e: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xce185: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xce22e: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xce2bf: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xce327: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xce36e: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xce3e7: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xce437: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xce4ae: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xce54b: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xce5f3: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xce677: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xce6c6: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xce7dc: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xce86d: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xce8db: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xce93a: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xce9b6: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xcea3d: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xceac2: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xceb94: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xcec02: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xcec68: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xcece4: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xced72: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xcee17: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xceebd: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xcef64: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xcf00c: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xcf06f: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xcf119: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xcf1a7: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xcf210: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xcf2ac: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xcf30c: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xcf36f: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xcf42c: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xcf4ba: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xcf523: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xcf5dd: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xcf67c: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xcf726: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xcf7a4: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xcf7ea: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xcf82c: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xcf879: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xcf8ad: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xcf917: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xcf9ee: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xcfa45: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xcfab8: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xcfb1a: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xcfbc4: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xcfc66: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.

0xd207e: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xd2152: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xd21eb: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xd2277: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xd22e0: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xd238b: You better use that weapon you found!
0xd23cd: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xd2460: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xd250e: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xd259a: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xd260f: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xd268f: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xd2724: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xd27d1: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xd2853: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xd2922: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xd29d8: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xd2a51: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xd2aed: ...I didn't know.
0xd2b09: Really?
0xd2b25: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xd2b9b: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xd2c47: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xd2caf: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xd2d4b: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xd2db5: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xd2e10: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xd2e8e: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xd2edc: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xd2f5f: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xd307f: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xd30ae: Thank God...
0xd30d9: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xd311a: She's got plenty of heart.
0xd3153: Thanks, Snake.
0xd316c: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xd31d3: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xd32c0: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xd330e: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xd33bb: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xd3453: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xd3497: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xd34d2: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xd351f: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xd35ea: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xd3653: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xd36e3: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xd372f: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xd379f: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xd388f: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xd38db: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xd396e: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xd39a5: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xd3a71: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xd3aba: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xd3b84: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xd3c04: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xd3caf: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xd3cdc: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xd3d56: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xd3dbd: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xd3e28: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xd3e8b: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xd3f10: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xd3f8d: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xd402f: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xd40b8: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xd4135: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xd41ed: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xd4224: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xd4249: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xd42e8: Are you smoking?
0xd4317: Yeah, so what?
0xd4336: Yeah, so what?
0xd4351: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xd43bc: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xd442c: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xd448e: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xd4528: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xd459b: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xd464c: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xd468a: Diazepam?
0xd469e: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xd4741: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xd477d: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xd47fd: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xd4863: I see.
0xd4874: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xd48f9: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xd4976: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xd49b5: I am a scientist.
0xd4a76: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xd4aed: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xd4b37: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xd4bda: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xd4c29: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xd4cbd: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xd4d47: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xd4dfb: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xd4edb: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xd4f41: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xd500e: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xd50a8: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xd5120: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xd51c7: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xd5257: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xd529b: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xd532f: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xd53ce: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xd5464: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xd54c1: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xd553f: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xd55b4: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xd5621: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xd56a3: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xd56ea: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xd5793: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xd5824: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xd588c: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xd58d3: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xd594c: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xd599c: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xd5a13: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xd5ab0: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xd5b58: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xd5bdc: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xd5c2b: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xd5d41: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xd5dd2: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xd5e40: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xd5e9f: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xd5f1b: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xd5fa2: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xd6027: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xd60f9: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xd6167: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xd61cd: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xd6249: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xd62d7: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xd637c: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xd6422: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xd64c9: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xd6571: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xd65d4: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xd667e: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xd670c: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xd6775: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xd6811: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xd6871: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xd68d4: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xd6991: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xd6a1f: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xd6a88: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xd6b42: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xd6be1: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xd6c8b: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xd6d09: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xd6d4f: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xd6d91: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xd6dde: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xd6e12: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xd6e7c: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xd6f53: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xd6faa: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xd701d: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xd707f: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xd7129: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xd71cb: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xd7237: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xd72f8: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xd73b0: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xd745b: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xd7503: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xd761d: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xd76ae: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xd771c: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xd777b: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xd77f7: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xd787e: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xd7903: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xd79d5: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xd7a43: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xd7aa9: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xd7b25: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xd7bb3: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xd7c4d: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xd7d24: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xd7d7b: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xd7dee: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xd7e50: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xd7eef: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xd7f4c: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xd7fca: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xd803f: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xd80ac: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xd812e: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xd8175: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.

0xd834a: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xd83e6: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xd848e: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xd84f1: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xd859b: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xd8629: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xd8692: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xd872e: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xd878e: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xd87f1: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xd88ae: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xd893c: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xd89a5: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xd8a54: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xd8af3: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xd8b9d: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.

0xd9490: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xd953b: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xd95e3: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xd96b7: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xd9750: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xd97dc: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xd9845: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xd98f0: You better use that weapon you found!
0xd9932: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xd99c5: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xd9a73: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xd9aff: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xd9b74: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xd9bf4: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xd9c89: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xd9d36: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xd9db8: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xd9e87: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xd9f3d: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xd9fb6: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xda052: ...I didn't know.
0xda06e: Really?
0xda08a: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xda100: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xda1ac: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xda214: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xda2b0: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xda31a: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xda375: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xda3f3: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xda441: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xda4c4: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xda5e4: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xda613: Thank God...
0xda63e: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xda67f: She's got plenty of heart.
0xda6b8: Thanks, Snake.
0xda6d1: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xda738: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xda825: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xda873: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xda920: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xda9b8: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xda9fc: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xdaa37: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xdaa84: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xdab4f: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xdabb8: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xdac48: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xdac94: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xdad04: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xdadf4: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xdae40: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xdaed3: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xdaf0a: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xdafd6: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xdb01f: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xdb0e9: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xdb169: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xdb214: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xdb241: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xdb2bb: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xdb322: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xdb38d: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xdb3f0: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xdb475: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xdb4f2: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xdb594: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xdb61d: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xdb69a: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xdb752: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xdb789: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xdb7ae: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xdb84d: Are you smoking?
0xdb87c: Yeah, so what?
0xdb89b: Yeah, so what?
0xdb8b6: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xdb921: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xdb991: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xdb9f3: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xdba8d: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xdbb00: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xdbbb1: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xdbbef: Diazepam?
0xdbc03: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xdbca6: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xdbce2: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xdbd62: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xdbdc8: I see.
0xdbdd9: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xdbe5e: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xdbedb: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xdbf1a: I am a scientist.
0xdbfdb: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xdc052: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xdc09c: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xdc13f: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xdc18e: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xdc222: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xdc2ac: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xdc360: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xdc440: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xdc4a6: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xdc573: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xdc60d: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xdc685: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xdc72c: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xdc7bc: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xdc800: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xdc894: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xdc933: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xdc9c9: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xdca26: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xdcaa4: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xdcb19: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xdcb86: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xdcc08: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xdcc4f: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xdccf8: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xdcd89: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xdcdf1: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xdce38: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xdceb1: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xdcf01: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xdcf78: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xdd015: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xdd0bd: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xdd141: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xdd190: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xdd2a6: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xdd337: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xdd3a5: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xdd404: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xdd480: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xdd507: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xdd58c: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xdd65e: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xdd6cc: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xdd732: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xdd7ae: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xdd83c: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xdd8e1: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xdd987: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xdda2e: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xddad6: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xddb39: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xddbe3: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xddc71: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xddcda: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xddd76: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xdddd6: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xdde39: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xddef6: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xddf84: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xddfed: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xde0a7: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xde146: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xde1f0: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xde26e: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xde2b4: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xde2f6: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xde343: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xde377: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xde3e1: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xde4b8: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xde50f: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xde582: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xde5e4: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xde68e: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xde730: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xde79c: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xde85d: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xde915: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xde9c0: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xdea68: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xdeb82: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xdec13: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xdec81: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xdece0: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xded5c: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xdede3: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xdee68: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xdef3a: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xdefa8: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xdf00e: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xdf08a: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xdf118: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xdf1b2: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xdf289: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xdf2e0: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xdf353: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xdf3b5: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xdf454: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xdf4b1: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xdf52f: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.

0xdf611: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xdf693: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xdf6da: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xdf783: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xdf809: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xdf8af: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xdf94b: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?

0xdfcf3: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xdfd56: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xdfe13: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xdfea1: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xdff0a: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xdffb9: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xe0058: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xe0102: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xe0180: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.

0xe04d7: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xe0574: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xe061c: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xe06a0: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xe06ef: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.

0xe0948: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xe09f5: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xe0aa0: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xe0b48: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xe0c1c: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xe0cb5: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xe0d41: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xe0daa: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xe0e55: You better use that weapon you found!
0xe0e97: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xe0f2a: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xe0fd8: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xe1064: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xe10d9: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xe1159: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xe11ee: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xe129b: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xe131d: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xe13ec: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xe14a2: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xe151b: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xe15b7: ...I didn't know.
0xe15d3: Really?
0xe15ef: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xe1665: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xe1711: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xe1779: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xe1815: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xe187f: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xe18da: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xe1958: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xe19a6: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xe1a29: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xe1b49: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xe1b78: Thank God...
0xe1ba3: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xe1be4: She's got plenty of heart.
0xe1c1d: Thanks, Snake.
0xe1c36: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xe1c9d: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xe1d8a: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xe1dd8: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xe1e85: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xe1f1d: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xe1f61: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xe1f9c: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xe1fe9: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xe20b4: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xe211d: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xe21ad: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xe21f9: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xe2269: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xe2359: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xe23a5: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xe2438: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xe246f: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xe253b: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xe2584: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xe264e: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xe26ce: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xe2779: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xe27a6: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xe2820: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xe2887: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xe28f2: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xe2955: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xe29da: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xe2a57: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xe2af9: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xe2b82: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xe2bff: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xe2cb7: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xe2cee: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xe2d13: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xe2db2: Are you smoking?
0xe2de1: Yeah, so what?
0xe2e00: Yeah, so what?
0xe2e1b: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xe2e86: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xe2ef6: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xe2f58: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xe2ff2: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xe3065: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xe3116: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xe3154: Diazepam?
0xe3168: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xe320b: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xe3247: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xe32c7: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xe332d: I see.
0xe333e: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xe33c3: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xe3440: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xe347f: I am a scientist.
0xe3540: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xe35b7: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xe3601: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xe36a4: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xe36f3: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xe3787: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xe3811: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xe38c5: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xe39a5: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xe3a0b: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xe3ad8: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xe3b72: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xe3bea: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xe3c91: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xe3d21: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xe3d65: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xe3df9: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xe3e98: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xe3f2e: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xe3f8b: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xe4009: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xe407e: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xe40eb: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xe416d: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xe41b4: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xe425d: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xe42ee: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xe4356: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xe439d: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xe4416: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xe4466: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xe44dd: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xe457a: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xe4622: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xe46a6: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xe46f5: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xe480b: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xe489c: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xe490a: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xe4969: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xe49e5: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xe4a6c: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xe4af1: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xe4bc3: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xe4c31: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xe4c97: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xe4d13: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xe4da1: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xe4e46: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xe4eec: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xe4f93: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xe503b: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xe509e: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xe5148: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xe51d6: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xe523f: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xe52db: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xe533b: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xe539e: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xe545b: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xe54e9: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xe5552: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xe560c: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xe56ab: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xe5755: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xe57d3: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xe5819: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xe585b: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xe58a8: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xe58dc: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xe5946: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xe5a1d: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xe5a74: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xe5ae7: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xe5b49: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xe5bf3: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xe5c95: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xe5d01: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xe5dc2: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xe5e7a: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xe5f25: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xe5fcd: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xe60e7: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xe6178: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xe61e6: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xe6245: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xe62c1: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xe6348: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xe63cd: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xe649f: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xe650d: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xe6573: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xe65ef: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xe667d: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xe6717: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xe67ee: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xe6845: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xe68b8: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xe691a: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?

0xe7378: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xe7406: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xe746f: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xe751e: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xe75bd: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.

0xe7cf4: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xe7d96: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xe7df7: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xe7ead: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xe7f5a: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xe8005: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xe80ad: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xe8181: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xe821a: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xe82a6: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xe830f: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xe83ba: You better use that weapon you found!
0xe83fc: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xe848f: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xe853d: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xe85c9: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xe863e: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xe86be: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xe8753: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xe8800: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xe8882: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xe8951: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xe8a07: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xe8a80: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xe8b1c: ...I didn't know.
0xe8b38: Really?
0xe8b54: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xe8bca: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xe8c76: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xe8cde: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xe8d7a: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xe8de4: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xe8e3f: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xe8ebd: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xe8f0b: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xe8f8e: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xe90ae: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xe90dd: Thank God...
0xe9108: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xe9149: She's got plenty of heart.
0xe9182: Thanks, Snake.
0xe919b: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xe9202: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xe92ef: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xe933d: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xe93ea: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xe9482: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xe94c6: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xe9501: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xe954e: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xe9619: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xe9682: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xe9712: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xe975e: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xe97ce: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xe98be: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xe990a: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xe999d: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xe99d4: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xe9aa0: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xe9ae9: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xe9bb3: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xe9c33: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xe9cde: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xe9d0b: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xe9d85: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xe9dec: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xe9e57: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xe9eba: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xe9f3f: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xe9fbc: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xea05e: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xea0e7: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xea164: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xea21c: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xea253: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xea278: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xea317: Are you smoking?
0xea346: Yeah, so what?
0xea365: Yeah, so what?
0xea380: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xea3eb: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xea45b: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xea4bd: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xea557: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xea5ca: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xea67b: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xea6b9: Diazepam?
0xea6cd: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xea770: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xea7ac: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xea82c: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xea892: I see.
0xea8a3: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xea928: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xea9a5: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xea9e4: I am a scientist.
0xeaaa5: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xeab1c: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xeab66: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xeac09: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xeac58: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xeacec: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xead76: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xeae2a: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xeaf0a: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xeaf70: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xeb03d: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xeb0d7: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xeb14f: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xeb1f6: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xeb286: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xeb2ca: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xeb35e: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xeb3fd: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xeb493: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xeb4f0: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xeb56e: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xeb5e3: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xeb650: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xeb6d2: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xeb719: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xeb7c2: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xeb853: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xeb8bb: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xeb902: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xeb97b: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xeb9cb: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xeba42: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xebadf: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xebb87: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xebc0b: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xebc5a: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xebd70: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xebe01: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xebe6f: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xebece: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xebf4a: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xebfd1: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xec056: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xec128: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xec196: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xec1fc: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xec278: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xec306: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xec3ab: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xec451: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xec4f8: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xec5a0: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xec603: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xec6ad: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xec73b: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xec7a4: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xec840: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xec8a0: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xec903: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xec9c0: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xeca4e: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xecab7: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xecb71: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xecc10: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xeccba: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xecd38: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xecd7e: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xecdc0: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xece0d: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xece41: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xeceab: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xecf82: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xecfd9: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xed04c: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xed0ae: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xed158: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xed1fa: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xed266: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xed327: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xed3df: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xed48a: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xed532: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xed64c: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xed6dd: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xed74b: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xed7aa: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xed826: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xed8ad: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xed932: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xeda04: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xeda72: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xedad8: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xedb54: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xedbe2: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xedc7c: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xedd53: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xeddaa: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xede1d: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xede7f: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xedf1e: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xedf7b: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xedff9: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xee06e: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xee0db: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xee15d: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xee1a4: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xee24d: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xee2d3: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xee379: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xee415: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xee4bd: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xee520: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xee5ca: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xee658: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xee6c1: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xee75d: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xee7bd: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xee820: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xee8dd: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xee96b: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xee9d4: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xeea83: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xeeb22: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xeebcc: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xeec4a: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xeec90: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xeecd2: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xeed1f: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xeed53: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xeedb2: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xeee1a: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xeee61: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xeeeda: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xeef2a: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xeefa1: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xef03e: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xef0e6: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xef16a: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xef1b9: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xef259: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xef2fb: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xef35c: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xef412: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xef4bf: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xef56a: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xef612: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xef6e6: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xef77f: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xef80b: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xef874: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xef91f: You better use that weapon you found!
0xef961: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xef9f4: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xefaa2: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xefb2e: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xefba3: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xefc23: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xefcb8: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xefd65: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xefde7: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xefeb6: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xeff6c: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xeffe5: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xf0081: ...I didn't know.
0xf009d: Really?
0xf00b9: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xf012f: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xf01db: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xf0243: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xf02df: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xf0349: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xf03a4: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xf0422: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xf0470: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xf04f3: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xf0613: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xf0642: Thank God...
0xf066d: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xf06ae: She's got plenty of heart.
0xf06e7: Thanks, Snake.
0xf0700: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xf0767: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xf0854: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xf08a2: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xf094f: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xf09e7: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xf0a2b: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xf0a66: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xf0ab3: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xf0b7e: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xf0be7: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xf0c77: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xf0cc3: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xf0d33: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xf0e23: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xf0e6f: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xf0f02: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xf0f39: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xf1005: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xf104e: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xf1118: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xf1198: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xf1243: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xf1270: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xf12ea: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xf1351: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xf13bc: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xf141f: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xf14a4: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xf1521: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xf15c3: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xf164c: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xf16c9: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xf1781: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xf17b8: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xf17dd: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xf187c: Are you smoking?
0xf18ab: Yeah, so what?
0xf18ca: Yeah, so what?
0xf18e5: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xf1950: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xf19c0: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xf1a22: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xf1abc: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xf1b2f: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xf1be0: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xf1c1e: Diazepam?
0xf1c32: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xf1cd5: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xf1d11: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xf1d91: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xf1df7: I see.
0xf1e08: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xf1e8d: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xf1f0a: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xf1f49: I am a scientist.
0xf200a: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xf2081: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xf20cb: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xf216e: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xf21bd: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xf2251: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xf22db: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xf238f: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xf246f: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xf24d5: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xf25a2: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xf263c: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xf26b4: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xf275b: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xf27eb: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xf282f: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xf28c3: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xf2962: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xf29f8: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xf2a55: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xf2ad3: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xf2b48: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xf2bb5: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xf2c37: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xf2c7e: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xf2d27: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xf2db8: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xf2e20: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xf2e67: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xf2ee0: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xf2f30: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xf2fa7: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xf3044: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xf30ec: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xf3170: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xf31bf: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xf32d5: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xf3366: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xf33d4: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xf3433: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xf34af: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xf3536: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xf35bb: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xf368d: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xf36fb: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xf3761: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xf37dd: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xf386b: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xf3910: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xf39b6: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xf3a5d: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xf3b05: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xf3b68: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xf3c12: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xf3ca0: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xf3d09: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xf3da5: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xf3e05: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xf3e68: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xf3f25: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xf3fb3: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xf401c: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xf40d6: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xf4175: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xf421f: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xf429d: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xf42e3: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xf4325: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xf4372: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xf43a6: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xf4410: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xf44e7: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xf453e: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xf45b1: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xf4613: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xf46bd: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xf475f: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xf47cb: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xf488c: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xf4944: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xf49ef: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xf4a97: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xf4bb1: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0xf4c42: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xf4cb0: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xf4d0f: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xf4d8b: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xf4e12: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xf4e97: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xf4f69: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xf4fd7: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xf503d: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xf50b9: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xf5147: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xf51e1: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xf52b8: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xf530f: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xf5382: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xf53e4: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xf5483: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xf54e0: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xf555e: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xf55d3: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xf5640: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xf56c2: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xf5709: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xf57b2: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xf5838: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xf58de: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xf597a: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xf5a22: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xf5a85: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xf5b2f: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xf5bbd: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xf5c26: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xf5cc2: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xf5d22: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xf5d85: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xf5e42: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xf5ed0: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xf5f39: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xf5fe8: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xf6087: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xf6131: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xf61af: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xf61f5: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xf6237: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xf6284: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xf62b8: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xf6317: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xf637f: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xf63c6: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xf643f: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xf648f: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xf6506: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xf65a3: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xf664b: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xf66cf: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xf671e: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xf67be: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xf6860: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xf68c1: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xf6977: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xf6a24: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xf6acf: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xf6b77: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xf6c4b: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xf6ce4: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xf6d70: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xf6dd9: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xf6e84: You better use that weapon you found!
0xf6ec6: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xf6f59: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xf7007: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xf7093: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xf7108: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xf7188: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xf721d: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xf72ca: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xf734c: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xf741b: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xf74d1: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xf754a: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xf75e6: ...I didn't know.
0xf7602: Really?
0xf761e: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xf7694: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xf7740: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xf77a8: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xf7844: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xf78ae: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xf7909: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xf7987: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xf79d5: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xf7a58: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xf7b78: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xf7ba7: Thank God...
0xf7bd2: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xf7c13: She's got plenty of heart.
0xf7c4c: Thanks, Snake.
0xf7c65: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xf7ccc: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xf7db9: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xf7e07: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xf7eb4: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xf7f4c: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xf7f90: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xf7fcb: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xf8018: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xf80e3: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xf814c: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xf81dc: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xf8228: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xf8298: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xf8388: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xf83d4: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xf8467: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xf849e: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xf856a: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xf85b3: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xf867d: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xf86fd: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xf87a8: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xf87d5: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xf884f: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xf88b6: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xf8921: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xf8984: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xf8a09: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xf8a86: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0xf8b28: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0xf8bb1: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0xf8c2e: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0xf8ce6: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0xf8d1d: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0xf8d42: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0xf8de1: Are you smoking?
0xf8e10: Yeah, so what?
0xf8e2f: Yeah, so what?
0xf8e4a: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0xf8eb5: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0xf8f25: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0xf8f87: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0xf9021: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xf9094: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0xf9145: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0xf9183: Diazepam?
0xf9197: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0xf923a: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0xf9276: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0xf92f6: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0xf935c: I see.
0xf936d: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0xf93f2: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0xf946f: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0xf94ae: I am a scientist.
0xf956f: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0xf95e6: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0xf9630: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0xf96d3: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0xf9722: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0xf97b6: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0xf9840: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0xf98f4: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0xf99d4: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0xf9a3a: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0xf9b07: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0xf9ba1: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0xf9c19: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xf9cc0: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0xf9d50: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0xf9d94: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0xf9e28: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0xf9ec7: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xf9f5d: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0xf9fba: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0xfa038: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0xfa0ad: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0xfa11a: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0xfa19c: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xfa1e3: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xfa28c: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xfa31d: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xfa385: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xfa3cc: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.

0xfa998: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xfaa14: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xfaa9b: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xfab20: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0xfabf2: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0xfac60: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0xfacc6: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0xfad42: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0xfadd0: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xfae75: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xfaf1b: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xfafc2: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xfb06a: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xfb0cd: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xfb177: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xfb205: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.

0xfb48a: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xfb518: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xfb581: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xfb63b: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xfb6da: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xfb784: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xfb802: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xfb848: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xfb88a: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xfb8d7: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xfb90b: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xfb975: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xfba4c: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xfbaa3: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0xfbb16: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0xfbb78: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0xfbc22: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xfbcc4: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xfbd30: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xfbdf1: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xfbea9: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xfbf54: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xfbffc: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xfc116: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands.

0xfc6ac: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0xfc746: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0xfc81d: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.

0xfcc27: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0xfcc6e: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0xfcd17: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0xfcd9d: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0xfce43: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0xfcedf: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0xfcf87: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xfcfea: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xfd094: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xfd122: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xfd18b: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xfd227: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0xfd287: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0xfd2ea: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0xfd3a7: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0xfd435: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0xfd49e: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0xfd54d: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.
0xfd5ec: Use it skillfully to see the openings in your enemy's actions and avoid being spotted while advancing.
0xfd696: In Corner View Mode you can hit the wall and make a noise, by pressing the Action Button.
0xfd714: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xfd75a: So I can trick the enemy and lure him my way, huh.
0xfd79c: You're good at tricking people, aren't you?
0xfd7e9: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xfd81d: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0xfd87c: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0xfd8e4: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0xfd92b: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0xfd9a4: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0xfd9f4: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0xfda6b: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0xfdb08: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0xfdbb0: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0xfdc34: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0xfdc83: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0xfdd23: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0xfddc5: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0xfde26: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0xfdedc: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0xfdf89: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0xfe034: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xfe0dc: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0xfe1b0: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0xfe249: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0xfe2d5: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0xfe33e: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0xfe3e9: You better use that weapon you found!
0xfe42b: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0xfe4be: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0xfe56c: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0xfe5f8: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0xfe66d: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0xfe6ed: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0xfe782: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0xfe82f: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0xfe8b1: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0xfe980: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0xfea36: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0xfeaaf: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0xfeb4b: ...I didn't know.
0xfeb67: Really?
0xfeb83: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0xfebf9: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0xfeca5: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0xfed0d: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0xfeda9: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0xfee13: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0xfee6e: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0xfeeec: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0xfef3a: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0xfefbd: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0xff0dd: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0xff10c: Thank God...
0xff137: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0xff178: She's got plenty of heart.
0xff1b1: Thanks, Snake.
0xff1ca: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0xff231: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0xff31e: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0xff36c: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0xff419: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0xff4b1: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0xff4f5: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0xff530: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0xff57d: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0xff648: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0xff6b1: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0xff741: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0xff78d: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0xff7fd: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0xff8ed: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0xff939: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0xff9cc: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xffa03: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0xffacf: Her frequency is 141.52.
0xffb18: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0xffbe2: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0xffc62: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0xffd0d: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0xffd3a: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0xffdb4: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0xffe1b: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0xffe86: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0xffee9: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0xfff6e: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0xfffeb: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0x10008d: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0x100116: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0x100193: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0x10024b: What have you got there? A cardboard box?
0x100282: Yeah. Remember that trick?
0x1002a7: That's the Snake I remember. Those poor fools won't know what hit em.
0x100346: Are you smoking?
0x100375: Yeah, so what?
0x100394: Yeah, so what?
0x1003af: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0x10041a: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0x10048a: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0x1004ec: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0x100586: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0x1005f9: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0x1006aa: The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is diazepam.
0x1006e8: Diazepam?
0x1006fc: It's a benzodiazepam based anti- anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system and it's often used as a psychotropic drug.
0x10079f: So how does it stop your hands from trembling?
0x1007db: Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective as muscle relaxants. They're widely used to treat psychosomatic disorders
0x10085b: such as autonomic ataxia or as pre-anesthetics to relax patients before an operation.
0x1008c1: I see.
0x1008d2: But be careful. If diazepam is used in large doses over a long period of time, it becomes addictive like alcohol.
0x100957: An adult should take no more than one to four doses per day, with each dose being .25 to .5 milligrams each.
0x1009d4: Jeez, you sound like a doctor.
0x100a13: I am a scientist.
0x100ad4: Good, you've got yourself a weapon. To use it, first hold down the R2 Button to enter "Weapon Mode."
0x100b4b: Then select the weapon you want with the Directional Button.
0x100b95: After you've selected the weapon you want, let go of the R2 Button to exit "Weapon Mode." The weapon you selected should appear in your hand.
0x100c38: To use the weapon, follow the directions displayed in the window.
0x100c87: If you use the R1 Button, you can equip your weapon more quickly. While you're barehanded, press the R1 Button to equip the last
0x100d1b: weapon you used. Press the R1 Button while you're holding a weapon to be barehanded again.
0x100da5: Don't fire your gun needlessly or you might be discovered. If you had a gun with a suppressor, it would be a different story...
0x100e59: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0x100f39: Snake! Look at your radar! We've picked up the DARPA Chief's signal.
0x100f9f: Can you see the green dot flashing on your radar? That's coming from the transmitter in the Chief's body. That's where you'll find him.
0x10106c: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0x101106: Snake, didn't you pick up the DARPA Chief's signal in the 1st floor basement?

0x10117e: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0x101225: Snake, your mission is to infiltrate, not to fight. Don't let the enemy see you.
0x1012b5: You didn't waste any time in getting spotted, did you?
0x1012f9: Too bad, it looks like your cover is blown. Proceed with extreme caution.
0x10138d: First you've got to rescue the DARPA Chief. Infiltrate the building in front. Look for some way to get in.
0x10142c: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0x1014c2: Snake. Just to make sure, let's review how to use the Codec system.
0x10151f: Snake, if you want to send a transmission, first press the Select Button. That will put you in Codec Mode.
0x10159d: When you're at the Codec Screen, press the right or left Directional Button to change the frequency.
0x101612: Then press up on the Directional Button or press the O Button to transmit at that frequency.
0x10167f: The Codec also automatically stores the frequencies of the people you've spoken to. To open the Memory Window,
0x101701: press down on the Directional Button at the Codec Screen.
0x101748: The Memory Window will show a list of all the frequencies. All you have to do is to select the frequency you want and press the O Button to transmit.
0x1017f1: If you want to switch back to the normal Codec Mode, just press  the Select or X Button.
0x101882: If you're spotted, all the enemies will come to attack you at once. That's Alert Mode. 
0x1018ea: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0x101931: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0x1019aa: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.

0x101b0e: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0x101bb6: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0x101c3a: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0x101c89: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0x101d9f: You still don't have a weapon. If you get into combat, you'll have to rely on your bare hands. 
0x101e30: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0x101e9e: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0x101efd: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0x101f79: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0x102000: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0x102085: You can knock them out for a little while or if you keep doing it, you can take 'em out permanently. The choice is up to you. But use it wisely.
0x102157: Listen up, Snake. In unarmed combat, your basic weapon is the punch. Press the Action Button.
0x1021c5: If you press it repeatedly, you can take your enemy out with a combo.
0x10222b: Not only that. When you're not holding a weapon, you can do a throw move by getting close to your enemy and
0x1022a7: pressing the Weapon Button while you hold down the Directional Button. That does more damage than a punch.
0x102335: If you press the Weapon Button without holding down the Directional Button, you can strangle your enemy.
0x1023da: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0x102480: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0x102527: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0x1025cf: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0x102632: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0x1026dc: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0x10276a: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0x1027d3: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.

0x102ae6: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0x102ba0: Snake, when you're up against certain walls or obstacles, you can look behind you while you're still hidden. We call that Corner View Mode.

0x102e3c: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0x102e70: Only beautiful women like yourself.
0x102eda: Snake, when you're in First Person View Mode, you can step to the right by pressing the R1 button or step to the left by pressing the L1 button.
0x102fb1: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0x103008: So I can just step out of the shadows and see what's up ahead, huh.
0x10307b: Yes. But remember that when you step out of the shadows you'll be easier to spot.
0x1030dd: So if you're in danger, let go of the button and get back into the shadows in a hurry, alright?
0x103187: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.

0x104e49: In that case, there's only two ways to get out of danger.
0x104e90: Either kill all the enemies that are coming after you, or escape from them for a certain amount of time.
0x104f09: You'll see a timer in the upper right radar portion of the screen.
0x104f59: That will tell you how much more time you need to stay out of sight in order to get out of Alert Mode.
0x104fd0: If you can escape until that counter reaches zero, the enemies will stop attacking you and you'll enter Evasion Mode.
0x10506d: But don't relax just because you're in Evasion Mode. The enemies will still be looking for you, so make sure you stay hidden so they can't find you.
0x105115: When the counter in the radar portion of the screen reaches zero again, the enemies will return to their positions.
0x105199: That's when you can breathe a sigh of relief.
0x1051e8: In any case, the most important thing is not to let the enemy see you. I want you to avoid any unnecessary combat.
0x105288: Snake, crawling is an important way to get through tight, narrow spaces. But you won't be able to attack while you're doing it, so be careful.
0x10532a: If you want to stand up, press the Crawl Button again.
0x10538b: If you find an Item Box, it's a good idea to get close and look at it in First Person View Mode. You'll be able to see what's inside.
0x105441: If you grab your enemy in a choke hold, you'll be able to drag him around. That way, you can use his body as a human shield.
0x1054ee: Snake, when you're in Normal Mode and you secretly kill an enemy, you can sometimes get items from them.
0x105599: If you use your strangle move or a suppressor on your SOCOM, you should be able to take out your enemies without making any noise.
0x105641: If you use your strangle hold effectively, you can take out your enemies without making any noise.
0x105715: Sorry Snake, but it looks like the rescue was a failure. There's no reason to stay in that cell anymore...
0x1057ae: Snake, get out of there and go to the 2nd floor basement. You've got to rescue the president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker,
0x10583a: before the terrorists find out his detonation code.
0x1058a3: Snake! What are you doing? Take care of the bad guys and get the hell out of there!
0x10594e: You better use that weapon you found!
0x105990: Try to pick up an enemy's fallen weapon!
0x105a23: Good. Looks like it worked. If what the DARPA Chief said is true, President Baker should be up ahead. Hurry up and get him out of there.
0x105ad1: The walls that were cemented over should look slightly different. Look at the walls carefully in First Person View Mode.
0x105b5d: Try to find the walls that have a different pattern.
0x105bd2: Did you try hitting the wall?  Maybe it'll sound different too.
0x105c52: You'll need some kind of explosive to destroy the wall...like C4 or something. Take a good look around the armory.
0x105ce7: Those C4 explosives you've got should be able to destroy the walls that were cemented over. 
0x105d94: President Baker should be somewhere around there. Hurry up and find him.
0x105e16: Also, you can't use your radar around there. Mei Ling says it's because of electronic jamming. If you want to know more, ask her.
0x105ee5: Snake, Psycho Mantis has the power to read people's minds. He got the DARPA Chief's detonation code. Hurry up or he'll get Baker's code too...
0x105f9b: That's right. If the terrorists get Baker's code, they'll be able to launch that nuke anytime they want.
0x106014: Yeah, they'll use Metal Gear to do it... Colonel, did you know they were conducting a military exercise here using Metal Gear?
0x1060b0: ...I didn't know.
0x1060cc: Really?
0x1060e8: Snake, you've got to understand. I'm just the middleman in this operation.
0x10615e: Anyway, hurry up and get to the 2nd floor basement! You've got to save the ArmsTech president before the terrorists find out his code.
0x10620a: President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.
0x106272: Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.
0x10630e: The DARPA Chief and President Baker...So now the terrorists know both detonation codes...
0x106378: Yeah. And on top of that, they both died right in front of my eyes.
0x1063d3: Snake, now that the terrorists have both detonation codes, the only way to stop a nuclear launch is to either
0x106451: use the detonation code release keys that Meryl's holding, or...
0x10649f: Or find the Metal Gear chief engineer that President Baker mentioned...Hal Emmerich.
0x106522: In any case, you should contact Meryl by Codec. Wasn't her frequency written on the back of the CD case?
0x106642: Don't worry, Colonel. Meryl is fine.
0x106671: Thank God...
0x10669c: Meryl is a very strong woman. I really respect her.
0x1066dd: She's got plenty of heart.
0x106716: Thanks, Snake.
0x10672f: Not so fast. The real mission is still ahead.
0x106796: Rescuing that Metal Gear engineer is now your primary goal. When Meryl opens up the cargo door, I want you to head north.
0x106883: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0x1068d1: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0x10697e: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0x106a16: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0x106a5a: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0x106a95: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0x106ae2: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0x106bad: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0x106c16: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0x106ca6: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0x106cf2: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x106d62: Meryl contacted you didn't she? Go through the cargo door in the north part of the hangar. Head for the Warhead Storage Building.
0x106e52: Snake, look out for that tank's main gun. It'll pulverise you.
0x106e9e: There should be some way. Ask Nastasha. She knows everything there is to know about weapon systems.
0x106f31: Her frequency is 141.52.
0x106f68: A tank can't operate by itself. It's actually a fairly delicate weapon. Don't worry. You've got at least a fighting chance. Ask Nastasha what she thinks.
0x107034: Her frequency is 141.52.
0x10707d: You can't get to the Warhead Storage Building unless you beat the tank, Snake. You've got to destroy it.
0x107134: Watch out for that surveillance camera. You can probably jam it temporarily with your Chaff.
0x1071b4: There should be a blind spot underneath that camera. You'll be okay if you stay flat up against the wall.
0x107279: Snake, it's gas! Hold your breath!
0x1072a6: Your O2 Gauge should appear underneath your Life Gauge. If you don't breathe, the gauge will decrease.
0x107320: When it reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin decrease.
0x107387: Try to find a Gas Mask.
0x1073f2: The gas that's being dispersed is probably an organic phosphorus- based nerve gas.
0x107455: It destroys the nervous system by interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter.
0x1074da: And you don't have to breathe it in for it to kill you. It can enter your body through skin contact as well.
0x107557: Victims die within fifteen minutes of the onset of symptoms such as nausea, perspiration, convulsions, headache, or difficulty with breathing.
0x1075f9: Your Sneaking Suit will give you some protection. It's made of a material similar to that which the NBC soldiers use.
0x107682: Also, I injected you with nanomachines that contain PAM (protopan chloride), a nerve gas neutralizing agent.
0x1076ff: But that will only give you temporary protection. You'd better find a Gas Mask!
0x107783: Don't make too much noise or you'll be spotted. Be careful when you're walking on that floor.
0x10781f: Use the elevator to change floors.
0x10784c: There should be a cargo elevator that you can take down somewhere around there.
0x1078ac: Try to find it.
0x10791f: Even though the Genome Soldiers are strengthened by gene therapy, they still need to sleep. You can move safely while they're napping.
0x1079d9: The Genome Soldiers were specially trained so they can enter into a light sleep any time and still remain in attack posture.
0x107a69: Be careful not to make noise when you're near them.
0x107aca: When they're yawning, their eyes are closed, so they shouldn't be able to see you. Be careful with your timing and you'll be okay.
0x107b8e: Even though the Genome Soldiers are strengthened by gene therapy, they still need to sleep. You can move safely while they're napping.
0x107c3b: When they're yawning, their eyes are closed, so they shouldn't be able to see you. Be careful with your timing and you'll be okay.
0x107d01: Snake, use the elevator to move from floor to floor.
0x107d43: To call the elevator, press the button on the nearby control panel by pressing the Action Button. The elevator should show up in no time.
0x107e1c: Use the elevator to change floors. To select the floor you want to go to, use the control panel inside the elevator, on the left.
0x107ed4: Press up or down on the Directional Button to choose the floor. Then press the Action Button to confirm or the X Button to cancel.
0x107ffc:  Button to cancel.
0x108027: Be careful. The elevator won't work in either Alert Mode or Evasion Mode.
0x1080aa: Hmm. It looks like the infrared sensors that were set up here have been switched off.
0x10813c: Press the Action Button to drop down.
0x108198: It looks like the Chief is being held in a cell. Find some way to get in there. Hurry up and get him out.
0x108251: Snake, that door is protected by a security system. It won't open without the right security card.
0x1082d6: You can only open the door with a security card that's got the same or a higher security clearance than the door.
0x10839c: Snake, that door is protected by a security system. It won't open without the right security card.
0x10841b: There must be some other way to get in. Take a look around. The best way to do that is to use "First Person View Mode."
0x1084a8: Press the First Person View Button to go into "First Person View Mode."
0x108511: You can only open the door with a security card that's got the same or a higher security clearance than the door.
0x1085c4: Snake, the DARPA Chief's signal is coming from somewhere in that area. Isn't there some place to drop down?
0x108640: Take a look around in First Person View Mode.
0x1086b7: Snake, if you want to go up or down a ladder, just press the Action button by the ladder.
0x10878e: Are you smoking?
0x1087bd: Yeah, so what?
0x1087dc: Yeah, so what?
0x1087f7: Didn't you know that cigarettes contain benzopyrene, a chemical that leads to lung cancer?
0x108862: We now know that when benzopyrene enters the body, it changes to benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)
0x1088d2: and attaches to the receptors on the P53 gene, the gene which causes lung cancer.
0x108934: The BPDE attaches to the P53 gene in three specific locations and causes pre-cancerous changes to the lung tissue.
0x1089ce: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0x108a41: You know a lot about science, but you don't know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning.
0x108ad2: It looks like the place is protected by infrared sensors. Somehow you'll have to make it past the beams.
0x108b7a: If you have any questions about weapons or equipment, you should ask our military analyst, Nastasha.  Her frequency is 141.52.
0x108c3c: Snake. Be careful. There are trap doors near there and the fall will kill you. Stay close up against the wall and you should be okay.
0x108cf4: You should be able to see where the trap doors are if you use your Thermal Goggles.
0x108da9: If you've got a question about FOX-HOUND, ask Dr. Naomi.
0x108e03: Revolver Ocelot is a former member of Spetsnaz.
0x108e40: After the fall of the Soviet Union, he apparently served in the Russian Tax Police's elite swat team.
0x108eb6: After that, he joined the SVR, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency, which was formerly a part of the KGB.
0x108f34: But according to my sources, he was dissatisfied with the rigid system of the KGB and wanted to get out.
0x108fad: That's when he was recruited by FOX-HOUND.
0x108fe5: He's a gun fanatic and totally obsessed with cowboy movies and spaghetti westerns.
0x109048: He's also something of a sadist...he learned the most advanced torture techniques while he was with Spetsnaz.
0x1090dd: Yeah, he had plenty of practice. The Lubianka Prison is located right there inside KGB headquarters.
0x10915e: In a gunfight, reloading is usually the most dangerous time. But he loves it. Use that to your advantage.
0x1091d8: You'll have to take him out when he's reloading. Can you see where his number of remaining bullets is displayed on the screen?
0x10926a: Wait for the right moment and then take him out!
0x1092dc: Make sure President Baker doesn't get hurt. If he's killed, it's all over.  Try not to cross over that yellow line or you might set off the explosion.
0x1093ba: You might also try to faze him with a Stun Grenade.
0x10942f: If you get too close to Ocelot, he'll run away and shoot you from distance. So be careful.
0x1094ce: Don't forget that President Baker is there. He's wrapped up in C4, so don't use any type of explosive near him.
0x109585: Make sure President Baker doesn't get hurt. If he's killed, it's all over.  Try not to cross over that yellow line or you might set off the explosion.
0x109642: In a gunfight, reloading is usually the most dangerous time. But he loves it. Use that to your advantage.
0x1096bc: You'll have to take him out when he's reloading. Can you see where his number of remaining bullets is displayed on the screen?
0x10974e: Wait for the right moment and then take him out!
0x10979f: You might also try to faze him with a Stun Grenade.
0x1097f3: If you get too close to Ocelot, he'll run away and shoot you from distance. So be careful.
0x109871: Don't forget that President Baker is there. He's wrapped up in C4, so don't use any type of explosive near him.
0x109924: Snake, there are gun cameras set up there. If they detect you, they'll open fire.
0x109986: Stay out of the cameras' field of vision. You could also try to jam them with Chaff.
0x109a59: Colonel, I got a Codec call from someone outside this operation!
0x109aa7: I know. We were monitoring the call. Mei Ling knows everything about the communications system, so let me have her explain it to you.
0x109b54: Well, if somebody knows your frequency, they can call you. But the question is how did he learn it... it's top secret information...
0x109bec: So you mean someone leaked  the information?
0x109c30: That's the only explanation I can think of...
0x109c6b: Mei Ling, do you know where that transmission originated from? 
0x109cb8: I'm sorry. The radio waves were too weak to locate their source. But I'm sure he's near you...somewhere on  the base.
0x109d61: Snake, you'll have to go through  the mine field to advance.
0x109df3: A minefield, huh. You'll need a Mine Detector.
0x109e2f: Meryl knows the base like the back of her hand. Why don't you ask her?
0x109e95: A mine field, huh. Don't forget to use your mine detector.
0x109edd: When you find out where a mine is, crawl forward and try to recover it.
0x109f46: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0x109fd6: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0x10a022: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x10a096: If you go north from there, you should come to the Warhead Storage Building.
0x10a126: Dr. Emmerich is probably being held there.
0x10a172: You've got to save him and find out how to destroy Metal Gear.
0x10a1fe: Be careful. You absolutely must not use weapons in that area.
0x10a269: I've already programmed the nanomachines so that he won't be able to, Colonel.
0x10a2d2: What! What are you talking about!?
0x10a309: Have you forgotten? That's where they keep the nuclear warheads. Can't you see them?
0x10a378: Yeah. There's lots of boxes piled up here, but...are they all warheads?
0x10a3e1: Yes. They're all dismantled warheads.
0x10a41b: They just leave them here? It's like President Baker said...totally careless.
0x10a479: They're working on a limited budget. They try to put on a pretty face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.
0x10a502: Nastasha knows lots more about it than I do. 
0x10a566: Her frequency is 141.52.
0x10a5ab: All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation mechanisms removed so there's no fear of them exploding.
0x10a634: But if the warheads are broken, they might leak plutonium and that would be a serious problem.
0x10a6dd: Snake, never use your weapon  on that floor.
0x10a756: Colonel, I saw your niece, but...
0x10a78c: Really? Where?
0x10a7a5: She went in the ladies' bathroom.
0x10a7d1: That's strange. I saw her go in, but now she's nowhere to be found.
0x10a840: You'll just have to look in the stalls, I guess.
0x10a87e: I guess you're right. I'll take em in order.
0x10a90b: Snake, are you okay?
0x10a92a: I've been better...
0x10a95c: How's Meryl?
0x10a992: ...They've got her.
0x10a9c4: Damn...!
0x10aa07: ..........
0x10aa46: ..........
0x10aa69: Snake,...
0x10aa7d: ...the government has decided not to give in to their demands.
0x10aac9: We're trying to buy some more time.
0x10aaf7: C'mon Colonel,...
0x10ab13: ...why don't you stop playing dumb?
0x10ab41: I'm sorry about Meryl. But I want the lies to end now.
0x10ab85: What are you talking about?
0x10abab: Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead, wasn't it?
0x10ac1d: You knew it all along, didn't you?
0x10ac54: ..........
0x10ac75: Why did you try to hide it?
0x10ac9b: ...I'm sorry...
0x10acb5: Can't tell the grunts, huh...
0x10acdd: ...You've changed a lot.
0x10ad00: Metal Gear...secret advanced nuclear weapons research...
0x10ad46: Does the White House know about this? How deep does it go?
0x10ad98: ...As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not been briefed about the Rex Project.
0x10ae09: "Need to know basis", is that the idea?
0x10ae3f: These are sensitive times. Even sub- critical nuclear tests are causing quite a stir.
0x10aea5: Plausible deniability, huh?
0x10aecb: Yes.
0x10aeda: And tomorrow, the President and his Russian counterpart are scheduled to sign the Start 3 Accord.
0x10af4c: I get it. That's the reason for the deadline.
0x10af9b: That's right, Snake.
0x10afba: And that's why we can't let this terrorist attack go public.
0x10b018: We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of TMDs.
0x10b06d: This has to do with the President's reputation and America's place as the dominant superpower.
0x10b0dc: So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution?
0x10b12a: Please Snake, just stop them...
0x10b154: Why should I?
0x10b16c: Because you're the only one who can.
0x10b19b: In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead.
0x10b1f0: I told you before.  I don't know the details.
0x10b22b: I don't believe you.
0x10b254: ..........
0x10b269: If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands?
0x10b2be: Let them have Big Boss's remains.
0x10b2f4: You see...
0x10b309: Or is there some reason that you can't do that?
0x10b350: Something you haven't told me about...
0x10b395: Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to eugenics experiments.
0x10b3fc: We don't want the existence of the genome army to go public.
0x10b446: And that's the only reason?
0x10b480: ..........
0x10b4a1: Huh! The hell with you!
0x10b4c3: I'm sorry...
0x10b4da: The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me.
0x10b539: Poor man.
0x10b557: But it's strange. He looks and smells like he's been dead for days.
0x10b5a8: All his blood's been drained out too.
0x10b600: Drained!?
0x10b628: Maybe to slow down decomposition?
0x10b65e: I have no idea.
0x10b678: But the Chief only died a few hours ago, right?
0x10b6b5: Right.
0x10b6c6: But he's already started to decompose.
0x10b6fa: What could it all be about?
0x10b72a: Something in his blood that they wanted?
0x10b760: I doubt it. Just the nanomachines and the transmitter.
0x10b7b8: Did the Chief tell them his detonation code?
0x10b7f2: I'm afraid so. It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch.
0x10b856: Damn. Is there any way to prevent it?
0x10b886: It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code.
0x10b8fa: It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly.
0x10b93f: You have to unlock it with three special card keys.
0x10b980: And where are those keys?
0x10b9a4: I've got one of them. I don't know where the other two are.
0x10b9ed: Besides, I'm locked up here.
0x10ba14: We've got no choice.  Forget about the keys.
0x10ba4e: Your top priority now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.
0x10ba92: I'm sorry to have to lay it all in your lap, but you're all I've got.
0x10bae5: Bust out of there and get to the Communications Tower.
0x10bb58: Also...
0x10bb74: What?
0x10bb84: I know it's asking a lot...
0x10bbaa: Meryl, right?
0x10bbc2: Yeah...
0x10bbd4: I'll save her.
0x10bbed: Thanks.
0x10bc5f: ..........
0x10bc7e: ..........
0x10bcb0: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x10bcde: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x10bd17: What can I say?
0x10bd31: Anything.
0x10bd4b: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x10bd79: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x10bdb2: What can I say?
0x10bdcc: Anything.
0x10bde2: I...I'm not a very good talker...
0x10be0e: Please...
0x10be22: ...tell me about yourself.
0x10be51: Myself?
0x10be63: ...That's a tough one.
0x10be84: Any family?
0x10bea4: ...That's not a happy topic for me.
0x10bedc: I don't have any family...
0x10bf01: No wait, there was a man who said he was my father...
0x10bf44: Where is he?
0x10bf5b: Dead.
0x10bf7f: ...by my own hand.
0x10bfb0: Big Boss.
0x10bfd8: What!? Big Boss!!? I had no idea.
0x10c01b: There was no way you could.
0x10c041: It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago.
0x10c070: Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.
0x10c0ce: So...is it true?
0x10c0e9: Was Big Boss really your father?
0x10c114: That's what he said...
0x10c135: That's all I know.
0x10c152: And you were able to kill him, knowing that?
0x10c18c: Yup.
0x10c1a5: How?
0x10c1b4: He wanted it.
0x10c1d6: Besides, some people just need killing...
0x10c221: That's patricide...!
0x10c24a: Yup.
0x10c259: That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.
0x10c297: The one we share in common.
0x10c2c0: Is that why you left FOX-HOUND?
0x10c2ea: Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska was the perfect place...
0x10c353: ...Snake.
0x10c37d: ...I didn't have a real family either.
0x10c3ae: Just a big brother who put me through school.
0x10c3e9: We weren't even blood-related and he was much older than me.
0x10c433: Where is he?
0x10c454: ...He's dead...
0x10c46e: I'm sorry...
0x10c48f: Snake...
0x10c4a2: ...is there a woman in your life?
0x10c4ce: After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.
0x10c524: Friends?
0x10c537: ...Roy Campbell...
0x10c572: Huh? You're still calling me friend?
0x10c5b5: Is that it?
0x10c5cb: No, there was another...
0x10c5ee: Frank Jaeger.
0x10c610: What!?
0x10c635: Big Boss's most trusted lieutenant
0x10c662: and the only member of FOX-HOUND ever to receive the codename "Fox."
0x10c6b6: ...Gray Fox.
0x10c6e1: ..........
0x10c70c: I learned a lot from him...
0x10c732: But...
0x10c743: ...didn't you try to kill each other?
0x10c773: It's true. We did. In Zanzibar.
0x10c79d: But it was nothing personal.
0x10c7c4: ...we were just professionals on opposite sides, that's all.
0x10c80e: And you still call yourself "friends"!?
0x10c842: Hard to believe?
0x10c85d: War is no reason to end a friendship.
0x10c88d: That's insane.
0x10c8a6: I first met him on the battlefield.
0x10c8d4: He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven.
0x10c90f: But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.
0x10c950: He was always so cool and precise. I was still green and he showed me the ropes.
0x10c9b1: You knew him well?
0x10c9ce: No. We never talked about our personal lives.
0x10ca09: Sort of an unwritten rule...
0x10ca30: The next time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies.
0x10ca7a: We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.
0x10cab3: I know it sounds strange to most people.
0x10cae9: But we were just two soldiers doing our jobs.
0x10cb2e: It's like a sport.
0x10cb4b: Men and their games!
0x10cb6a: You're like wild animals!
0x10cb8e: You're right. We are animals.
0x10cbb6: So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior?
0x10cc09: I don't know.
0x10cc21: It's your genes...they make you predisposed towards violence!
0x10cc6c: You really like talking about genes, Naomi.
0x10cca5: Why did you get into genetic research anyway?
0x10ccf6: ...I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like.
0x10cd46: I guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm the way I am.
0x10cda7: So you studied about DNA?
0x10cdcb: Yeah. I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out who I really was.
0x10ce2a: I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic information,
0x10ce73: I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's memory.
0x10ceba: Memory is stored in DNA?
0x10cedd: We're not sure.
0x10cef7: But we know that a person's genetic fate is determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA.
0x10cf80: So what about my fate?
0x10cfa1: You know my DNA sequence, don't you?
0x10cfe7: Your fate?
0x10cffc: I...
0x10d00b: ...I'm sorry. I have no idea.
0x10d033: Of course not.
0x10d04c: You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
0x10d080: ..........
0x10d121: You okay, Snake?
0x10d15b: Yeah...nothing new to report.
0x10d197: Snake, is there anything I can do?
0x10d1d0: Yeah, my arm hurts...
0x10d1f0: ...Poor Snake.
0x10d209: I'll increase the level of pain killers in your blood.
0x10d24d: Okay, but you can leave out the benzedrine.
0x10d286: That stuff makes me too frisky.
0x10d2b0: I guess you're not feeling too bad after all.
0x10d319: Snake, put the controller up against your arm.
0x10d355: What?
0x10d365: Don't worry. It'll feel good.
0x10d38d: Huh?
0x10d39c: Okay, here I go.
0x10d3d4: Ooooh.
0x10d3ef: How does that feel, Snake?
0x10d414: A little better?
0x10d42f: How did you do that?
0x10d44e: I stimulated your muscle fibers with the nanomachine's cilia.
0x10d499: That's about all I can do for you...
0x10d4e6: ..........
0x10d4fb: I'm not the right guy.  I can't save the world.
0x10d54c: What's wrong?
0x10d564: I gave in to the pain...
0x10d5a5: I'm sorry, Colonel.
0x10d5e1: I sacrificed Meryl to save myself...
0x10d624: ...Snake..........
0x10d64b: She was a soldier. She knew the risks.
0x10d67c: Battlefield casualties are always tragic, but they're an unavoidable  part of war.
0x10d6f3: Don't blame yourself.
0x10d713: You still have a mission to do.
0x10d73d: ..........
0x10d7bc: ..........
0x10d7db: ..........
0x10d80d: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x10d83b: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x10d874: What can I say?
0x10d88e: Anything.
0x10d8a8: Naomi, please talk to me.
0x10d8d6: Say something to take my mind off the pain.
0x10d90f: What can I say?
0x10d929: Anything.
0x10d93f: I...I'm not a very good talker...
0x10d96b: Please...
0x10d97f: ...tell me about yourself.
0x10d9ae: Myself?
0x10d9c0: ...That's a tough one.
0x10d9e1: Any family?
0x10da01: ...That's not a happy topic for me.
0x10da39: I don't have any family...
0x10da5e: No wait, there was a man who said he was my father...
0x10daa1: Where is he?
0x10dab8: Dead.
0x10dadc: ...by my own hand.
0x10db0d: Big Boss.
0x10db35: What!? Big Boss!!? I had no idea.
0x10db78: There was no way you could.
0x10db9e: It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago.
0x10dbcd: Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there.
0x10dc2b: So...is it true?
0x10dc46: Was Big Boss really your father?
0x10dc71: That's what he said...
0x10dc92: That's all I know.
0x10dcaf: And you were able to kill him, knowing that?
0x10dce9: Yup.
0x10dd02: How?
0x10dd11: He wanted it.
0x10dd33: Besides, some people just need killing...
0x10dd7e: That's patricide...!

0x10dfcb: I'm sorry...
0x10dfec: Snake...
0x10dfff: ...is there a woman in your life?
0x10e02b: After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone.
0x10e081: Friends?
0x10e094: ...Roy Campbell...
0x10e0cf: Huh? You're still calling me friend?

0x10eb90: Of course not.
0x10eba9: You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
0x10ebdd: ..........
0x10ec5f: The guard is only human. He has to sleep and go to the bathroom like the rest of us. That'll be your chance.
0x10ecef: Snake, don't worry. You'll have a chance to escape. Hang on.

0x10ed7d: I don't know how, but the door is open.
0x10edaf: I saw the silhouette of someone in stealth cammies...
0x10edf2: Stealth camouflage? Could it be Emmerich?
0x10ee29: No, I don't think it was Otacon.
0x10ee5e: So who then?.....You don't think it could be Gray Fox?
0x10eea2: Yeah, I do. I think it was...
0x10eede: ...Are you saying that he came to save his friend?
0x10ef1e: Could be. Or maybe he just doesn't want me to die in a prison cell.
0x10ef79: ...I don't know. I can't imagine what he could be thinking...
0x10f000: Snake, you can worry about it later. Now is the time to escape.
0x10f075: Great job with the guard, Snake. Now is your chance to escape.
0x10f0c1: I plan on it. Next time I meet Ocelot, it's going to be on my terms...
0x10f152: How do you feel, Snake? Can you go on?
0x10f186: Yeah. Don't worry. That sadist can't keep me down.
0x10f1da: Snake. Now is your chance to escape.

0x10f245: Snake, you can worry about it later. Now is the time to escape.
0x10f2c6: The ketchup! You might be able to trick the guard if you use it right.
0x10f32e: Snake, why don't you use the ketchup and pretend that you're dead?
0x10f39d: The guard is only human. He has to sleep and go to the bathroom like the rest of us. That'll be your chance.
0x10f42d: Snake, don't worry. You'll have a chance to escape. Hang on.
0x10f499: Snake, that's a prison cell. You can't open the door from the inside. Somehow you'll have to get the key off the guard.
0x10f524: Yeah, but how?
0x10f551: Why don't you try disappearing?
0x10f59a: The guard is only human. He has to sleep and go to the bathroom like the rest of us. That'll be your chance.
0x10f62a: Snake, don't worry. You'll have a chance to escape. Hang on.
0x10f6a8: Snake, wait a minute. You forgot to take your items.
0x10f6fe: They're probably being kept somewhere close by.
0x10f7b1: I made it to the bottom.
0x10f7f3: Thank God you're okay. I was terrified just watching you.
0x10f84c: You're incredible, Snake.
0x10f8cd: Snake, why don't you try the door that leads from the walkway to Tower A?
0x10f9d7: Snake, the Hind is still circling above the Communications Tower.
0x10fa26: Damn. There's no weapon here that I can use to take him on.
0x10fa8d: Dr. Emmerich might know where there's a weapon you could use against the Hind. Why don't you ask him.
0x10fb18: Snake, hurry up and get those Stinger Missiles. Didn't Emmerich say they're near the entrance to the walkway in tower B?
0x10fbc0: The way to the top is blocked, huh...Well we can worry about that later. Why don't you go and see what's happening below?
0x10fc72: It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you. I'm looking at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.
0x10fd21: Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just circling around like a buzzard.
0x10fd75: I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast?
0x10fdc5: Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do something to help.
0x10fe19: Snake...I don't like it.  Please don't go up to the roof.
0x10fe60: I have to. I can't run from this one.
0x10fec6: Liquid is waiting for you up on the roof...
0x10ff11: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x10ff6b: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x10ffb6: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x110010: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x110107: Snake, the Hind is still circling above the Communications Tower.
0x110156: Damn. There's no weapon here that I can use to take him on.
0x1101bd: Dr. Emmerich might know where there's a weapon you could use against the Hind. Why don't you ask him.
0x110248: Snake, hurry up and get those Stinger Missiles. Didn't Emmerich say they're near the entrance to the walkway in tower B?
0x1102e8: The staircase is broken...tough luck. It looks like the elevator is the only way up now. Okay, Snake, I want you to head up there right away.
0x11039d: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x1103f7: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x1104c8: It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you. I'm looking at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.
0x110577: Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just circling around like a buzzard.
0x1105cb: I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast?
0x11061b: Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do something to help.
0x11066f: Snake...I don't like it.  Please don't go up to the roof.
0x1106b6: I have to. I can't run from this one.
0x11071c: Liquid is waiting for you up on the roof...
0x110767: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x1107c1: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x11080a: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x110864: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x110935: Liquid means to bring this to an end now. He obviously planned this.
0x11099b: Maybe the broken elevator was all part of the trap.
0x1109dc: You mean he fiddled with the elevator to get me out on the roof?
0x110a69: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0x110ae4: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0x110b81: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0x110bd4: Use your ears, Snake. You should be able to tell where he's coming from by the sound of his rotor blades.
0x110c86: Huh? Snake, you're not using a stereo TV!?
0x110cdc: It can't be!
0x110d1b: A Mono TV...
0x110d46: Hmmmmmm....
0x110d70: Well Colonel...there's nothing we can do about it...
0x110dc6: ...I guess you're right.
0x110de9: Snake, don't worry about it. There's more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. You can do it just the way you are!
0x110e9b: A mono TV...
0x110f01: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0x110f9e: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0x111004: You can see the Hind on your radar screen. Even if you lose visual contact, you can always check his position by radar.
0x1110a1: You'll have to destroy that Hind, Snake.
0x1110e9: Use your ears, Snake. You should be able to tell where he's coming from by the sound of his rotor blades.
0x11119b: Huh? Snake, you're not using a stereo TV!?
0x1111f1: It can't be!
0x111230: A Mono TV...
0x11125b: Hmmmmmm....
0x111285: Well Colonel...there's nothing we can do about it...
0x1112db: ...I guess you're right.
0x1112fe: Snake, don't worry about it. There's more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. You can do it just the way you are!
0x1113b0: A mono TV...
0x111409: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x111463: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x1114d3: You did it, Snake! You shot down the Hind! 
0x111520: I was so worried...
0x111552: Liquid couldn't have survived that.
0x111580: I wonder...
0x111596: But even so, just cause we've taken out their leader doesn't mean they're going to give up. They're still going to try to launch that nuke.
0x111635: You're right. There's no time to waste.
0x111688: Hurry. The underground base is past the Communications Tower. The elevator is working again, isn't it?
0x111751: Snake, you're under attack from off-screen.
0x11178a: What should I do?
0x1117e2: First find out where the enemy is. Use your binoculars.
0x111827: Then attack with a PSG-1 or Remote Controlled Missile. Something with a longer range than an ordinary weapon.
0x1118d4: Snake, why don't you try the door that leads from the walkway to Tower A?
0x111976: Snake, the Hind is still circling above the Communications Tower.
0x1119c5: Damn. There's no weapon here that I can use to take him on.
0x111a2c: Dr. Emmerich might know where there's a weapon you could use against the Hind. Why don't you ask him.
0x111ab7: Snake, hurry up and get those Stinger Missiles. Didn't Emmerich say they're near the entrance to the walkway in tower B?
0x111b6a: It looks like Liquid really wants to have a showdown with you. I'm looking at Mei Ling's digitally enhanced satellite images right now.
0x111c19: Snake, he's waiting for you. He's just circling around like a buzzard.
0x111c6d: I hope everyone's enjoying the live broadcast?
0x111cbd: Sorry, Snake. I wish I could do something to help.
0x111d11: Snake...I don't like it.  Please don't go up to the roof.
0x111d58: I have to. I can't run from this one.
0x111dbe: Liquid is waiting for you up on the roof...
0x111e09: Liquid is still hovering around the roof of tower B. He's waiting for you...
0x111e63: Snake, it's time for you to take him on!
0x111eef: Snake, didn't you hear that the DARPA Chief was moved to a cell in the 1st floor basement?
0x111f97: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0x111ffa: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0x1120a4: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0x112132: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0x11219b: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0x112237: Snake, first you've got to find the DARPA Chief. Look for clues.
0x112297: Snake, when you enter a narrow space, you'll automatically go into Intrusion Mode.
0x1122fa: Press up on the Directional Button to go forward and down to retreat backwards. You can also press right or left to face either direction.
0x1123b7: Advance while hiding yourself. Pay attention to the enemies' actions and make sure you're not discovered.
0x112445: But be careful. You can't attack while you're in Intrusion Mode either.
0x1124ae: And even if you go into Intrusion Mode while you're being chased, the enemy's grenades will still follow you.
0x112576: The O2 Gauge is automatically displayed whenever you're underwater or surrounded by gas.  It represents one breath.
0x11261c: When the O2 Gauge reaches zero, your Life Gauge will begin to go down.
0x1126c1: What's this pile of corpses...!? It looks like they were all slashed by some kind of sword.
0x112755: It couldn't be!...
0x112772: What!?
0x11278d: ...uh nothing.....
0x1127e6: Snake, I'm worried about Emmerich. Hurry up and get to him!
0x11285b: Snake, be careful. You won't be able to control your missile in an area with electronic jamming.
0x11291e: Snake, Meryl's not herself.  Don't use your weapon.
0x112973: It's Psycho Mantis. He's controlling Meryl. That tune is his mind control music.
0x1129fe: Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.
0x112a71: I can't see Mantis!
0x112aa3: Snake, he has mind powers,  but he's not a magician. 
0x112ae6: I get it. Stealth camouflage maybe?
0x112b28: Meryl is being controlled by him.
0x112b60: Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.
0x112bc3: My First Person View Mode isn't working right.
0x112bff: You're seeing what he's seeing. It's a result of his telepathic powers. Maybe you can use that to find him!
0x112c8d: Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.
0x112d46: That's Psycho Mantis...former KGB psychic. He has powerful telepathic abilities.
0x112da7: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he came to America looking for a job. He worked with the FBI on several cases as a psychic profiler.
0x112e47: Five years ago he was working on the case of a multiple serial murderer ...and he got too far into the killer's mind.
0x112ed0: As a result, he became just like the killer.
0x112f1e: So he was sort of infected by this serial murderer's thoughts...?
0x112f81: In any case, after that he became sort of a psychic spy working for the highest bidder. He travelled all around the world.
0x11300f: That's when he was recruited by FOX-HOUND.
0x113053: He can read people's minds. He knows every move that you're going to make. 
0x1130af: What should I do? I've got no chance of beating him.
0x113105: There must be some way.
0x11313b: He's a master at controlling people. Snake! Don't let him manipulate you!
0x1131b0: Not everything you see with your two eyes is real. Destroying his spirit is more important than destroying his body.
0x11324c: Don't let him read you. Be a blank slate! Okay? Clear your mind.
0x1132b8: He read your mind with his psychic abilities. Somehow you've got to get around him!
0x113359: I've got it. Use the Controller port!!
0x11338a: Plug your Controller into Controller port 2. If you do that he won't be able to read your mind!
0x113456: Snake, is there some reason you can't use Controller port 2?
0x1134a0: Oh well, it's okay. Do you see something that looks like a statue on both sides of the room?
0x11350d: Yeah. You mean those things with their faces all wrapped up in leather bands?
0x11356b: Yes. Attack those statues to uncover their faces.
0x1135aa: Why?
0x1135cd: Those statues were modeled after Mantis' real face.
0x11360e: Mantis despises the sight of his own face. If he suddenly sees his own disfigured face staring at him, it might break his concentration.
0x1136e6: Snake, if you destroy the faces of those statues, you should be able to disturb Mantis' psychic powers.
0x113772: He's using his psychic ability to read your Controller's moves. That's how he's evading your attack.
0x1137e7: You've got to do something so he can't read your Controller's moves. Think! There must be some way!
0x11388b: Snake, isn't that the elevator that goes down to Metal Gear's underground base?
0x11390a: Yeah, but there's no button for calling the elevator.
0x11394d: Maybe it'll come if you wait.
0x113989: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?
0x1139f1: Watch out for the steam. It's dangerous. Use your First Person View Mode to see where the steam is coming out and then avoid it.
0x113aa4: Yeah. I like a sauna now and then, but this is too much.
0x113b14: Snake, don't forget this is a covert operation. There are lots of bad guys and only one of you.
0x113b84: If you're spotted, you'll be surrounded before you know it.
0x113bed: If that happens, you're finished.
0x113c39: First go to the elevator in the back and take it up to the ground floor. Then look for the DARPA Chief.
0x113cf0: That M1 tank is equipped with advanced vetronics. Once it locks on to a target, it automatically tracks it,
0x113d6f: and its main gun is effective up to 3000 meters.
0x113dad: To get close, you'll have to confuse its tracking system. Use your Chaff.
0x113e04: If you can jam the system and get close enough, it won't be able to use its main gun.
0x113e76: Use your Chaff at a long distance to fool its electronic systems.
0x113ef3: Even if you can get close, the M1 tank's maximum speed is 45 miles per hour. First, you'll have to slow it down.
0x113f74: Go after its caterpillars with C4 or Grenades.
0x113fb0: Once it slows down, toss a Grenade in the commander's turret.
0x113ffb: The M1 has exceptionally strong armor.
0x11402f: With your weapons, the only way to beat it is to attack the soldiers inside through the hatch.
0x1140aa: Try to aim at the upper hatch with your grenades.
0x114117: Use your Chaff at a long distance to fool its electronic systems.
0x114179: Try to aim at the upper hatch with your grenades.
0x1141e8: Use your Chaff at a long distance to fool its electronic systems.
0x114273: You have Stinger missiles. Now you have at least got a chance against the Hind...
0x1142f4: Only a chance?
0x11430d: Well you are not exactly evenly armed.
0x114341: That Hind is a monster. You have only a small chance to win, but at least it's better than no chance...
0x1143b9: That's a pretty grim analysis, Nastasha.
0x1143ef: To shoot down that Hind, you will have to get to a place with good visibility.
0x11444e: Do not try to fight in that walkway. Get up on that roof where you will have a clean shot at him.
0x114569: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1145f1: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x11463e: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x114687: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x1146d5: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x11473f: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x1147d0: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x114889: You're a tough lady.
0x1148ae: You're a tough lady.
0x1148cf: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x11491b: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x114979: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x114a01: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x114a95: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x114b25: Same here, Snake.
0x114b3b: 7HNASTASHA
0x114bc6: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x114c55: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x114ccb: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x114d50: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x114dc1: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x114dfe: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x114e64: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x114ea3: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x114f0f: You don't mean...
0x114f2b: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x114fbf: ..........
0x114fd4: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x115051: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x11508d: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x115111: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x115170: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x1151bf: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x11525e: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x1152d4: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x11535e: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x1153de: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x115435: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x1154aa: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x115592: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x11562f: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x11568e: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x115725: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x115795: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x1157db: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x11584a: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x1158fd: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x115986: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x1159e2: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x115a57: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x115b23: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x115bbd: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x115bec: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x115c45: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x115d29: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x115d88: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x115e3c: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x115ec9: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x115f13: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x115f8c: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x115fc2: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x11604b: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x116099: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x116148: That is a FAMAS.
0x116163: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x116206: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x1162cd: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x1162f1: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x116331: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x1163ac: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x11643e: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x1164ac: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x116570: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x1165e0: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x11661a: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x1166ad: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x116705: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x1167b3: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x116808: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x11687e: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x116914: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x11698e: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x116a10: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x116a3d: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x116ac2: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x116b09: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x116ba6: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x116be6: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x116ccf: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x116d12: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x116d7d: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x116dc7: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x116e64: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x116ee1: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x116f6f: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x11700f: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x117069: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x117134: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x117177: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x117263: A cardboard box.
0x11727e: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x117310: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x11739d: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x11740d: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x1174a9: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x117542: wood or something.
0x11755f: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x1175c6: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x1175f3: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x117662: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x117686: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x11770e: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x11776b: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x1177d9: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x11782b: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x1178e0: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x1178ff: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x117954: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x1179cb: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x117a18: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x117aa4: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x117b21: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x117b7c: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x117c46: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x117cbc: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x117d3a: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x117d6c: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x117e00: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x117ea4: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x117f4c: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x117f86: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x118072: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x1180c5: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x1181d8: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x118251: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x11829a: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x118305: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x11838a: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x1183ef: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x118455: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x1184d3: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x118559: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x1185a5: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x1185fa: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x118644: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x1186be: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x118747: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x1187ed: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x118856: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x11889f: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x11893d: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x1189c4: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x118a3d: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x118abd: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x118b79: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x118bf2: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x118c3b: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x118ca6: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x118d2b: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x118d90: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x118df6: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x118e74: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x118efa: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x118f46: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x118f7a: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x118fc4: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x11903e: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x1190c7: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x11914c: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x1191b5: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x1191fe: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x11927b: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x119302: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x11937b: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1193fb: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x119522: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.

0x119b7f: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x119c0e: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x119c84: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x119d09: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x119d7a: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x119db7: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x119e1d: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x119e5c: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x119ec8: You don't mean...
0x119ee4: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x119f78: ..........
0x119f8d: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x11a00a: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x11a046: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x11a0ca: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x11a129: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x11a178: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x11a217: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x11a28d: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x11a317: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x11a397: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x11a3ee: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x11a463: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x11a54b: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x11a5e8: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x11a647: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x11a6de: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x11a74e: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x11a794: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x11a803: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x11a8b6: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x11a93f: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x11a99b: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x11aa10: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x11aadc: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x11ab76: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x11aba5: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x11abfe: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x11ace2: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x11ad41: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x11adf5: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x11ae82: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x11aecc: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x11af45: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x11af7b: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x11b004: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x11b052: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x11b101: That is a FAMAS.
0x11b11c: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x11b1bf: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x11b286: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x11b2aa: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x11b2ea: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x11b365: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x11b3f7: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x11b465: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x11b529: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x11b599: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x11b5d3: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x11b666: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x11b6be: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x11b76c: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x11b7c1: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x11b837: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x11b8cd: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x11b947: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x11b9c9: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x11b9f6: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x11ba7b: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x11bac2: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x11bb5f: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x11bb9f: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x11bc88: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x11bccb: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x11bd36: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x11bd80: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x11be1d: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x11be9a: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x11bf28: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x11bfc8: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x11c022: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x11c0ed: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x11c130: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x11c21c: A cardboard box.
0x11c237: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x11c2c9: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x11c356: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x11c3c6: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x11c462: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x11c4fb: wood or something.
0x11c518: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x11c57f: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x11c5ac: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x11c61b: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x11c63f: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x11c6c7: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x11c724: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x11c792: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x11c7e4: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x11c899: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x11c8b8: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x11c90d: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x11c984: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x11c9d1: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x11ca5d: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x11cada: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x11cb35: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x11cbff: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x11cc75: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x11ccf3: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x11cd25: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x11cdb9: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x11ce5d: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x11cf05: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x11cf3f: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x11d02b: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x11d07e: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x11d1a4: They were conducting exercises with this new Metal Gear prototype? Is that what the DARPA Chief said?
0x11d21a: Yeah.
0x11d22a: What the hell...!?
0x11d247: So you know about Metal Gear?
0x11d26f: Just rumors. I heard it is some kind of walking tank that can deliver an accurate nuclear strike from any terrain...mountains, deserts, swamps...
0x11d314: ...wherever. But you are the real expert on Metal Gear, aren't you Snake?
0x11d36e: Yeah, I guess I am. But what about the PAL system that the DARPA Chief  mentioned?
0x11d3d1: It is a device attached to a nuclear weapon system to prevent the missile from being armed or launched.
0x11d449: Usually a secret detonation code or combination is necessary to launch the missile.
0x11d4ad: According to the chief, there are two codes and the terrorists already know one of them.
0x11d516: The other code...if the terrorists find out that one too...
0x11d55f: Yeah... I've got to hurry and rescue President Baker...
0x11d5c2: PAL stands for "Permissive Action Link." It is a safety system attached to nuclear missile systems.
0x11d638: The missile cannot be fired without the insertion of a special electronic code.
0x11d698: But if the terrorists have found out the detonation codes, they can launch the missile anytime they want.
0x11d730: Is it possible to destroy the PAL system so that the missile can be fired even without inserting the detonation code?
0x11d7b9: I do not believe so.
0x11d7d8: It is set up so that the warhead will become automatically inactive if any attempt is made to remove, deactivate or destroy the PAL.
0x11d870: So unless the terrorists either learn the detonation codes or get their hands on the detonation code override keys,
0x11d8f7: ...there's no way they can launch...
0x11d926: Do not be too sure. Any system can contain bugs or malfunctions. We cannot relax yet.
0x11d9aa: I do not know much about Metal Gear. Just the little I have heard.
0x11d9fa: I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in 1995 and then again in Zanzibar in 1999...
0x11da5b: Both were Third World countries led by military regimes.
0x11daa1: They secretly developed Metal Gear to increase their military and political power throughout the world.
0x11db19: But both were stopped by a lone hero...you, Solid Snake.
0x11db5f: ..........
0x11db74: That was a long time ago....
0x11dbb9: All the ICBM silos are closely monitored by military satellites.
0x11dc07: SLBM-equipped submarines can move secretly, but naturally they are limited to launching from the water.
0x11dc7f: Finally, there are ALBMs which can be launched from aircraft. They allow for excellent mobility, but they are somewhat unreliable...
0x11dd17: Metal Gear was developed to solve all those problems.
0x11dd5a: It can move freely over any terrain and independently launch a nuclear missile at any target in the world.
0x11ddd5: It completely changes the nature of the strategic arms race and destroys the delicate nuclear balance...It's  a weapon to be feared, believe me.
0x11de97: The development of Metal Gear is a cynical attempt to consolidate and increase our military dominance...
0x11df10: ...while at the same time maintaining the pretense of disarming ourselves.
0x11df68: Now that the SLCM zero option, allowing for the sneak inspections of submarines in international waters, has been concluded,
0x11dff8: ...the value of submarines as strategic weapons has been greatly diminished.
0x11e052: With Metal Gear, governments of the world will be able to avoid this type of inspection,
0x11e0bb: ...and at the same time stay in compliance with international nuclear treaties.
0x11e139: PAL stands for "Permissive Action Link." It is a safety system attached to nuclear missile systems.
0x11e1af: The missile cannot be fired without the insertion of a special electronic code.
0x11e20f: But if the terrorists have found out the detonation codes, they can launch the missile anytime they want.
0x11e29c: Is it possible to destroy the PAL system so that the missile can be fired even without inserting the detonation code?
0x11e325: I do not believe so.
0x11e344: It is set up so that the warhead will become automatically inactive if any attempt is made to remove, deactivate or destroy the PAL.
0x11e3dc: So unless the terrorists either learn the detonation codes or get their hands on the detonation code override keys,
0x11e463: ...there's no way they can launch...
0x11e492: Do not be too sure. Any system can contain bugs or malfunctions. We cannot relax yet.
0x11e50b: I do not know much about Metal Gear. Just the little I have heard.
0x11e55b: I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in 1995 and then again in Zanzibar in 1999...
0x11e5bc: Both were Third World countries led by military regimes.
0x11e602: They secretly developed Metal Gear to increase their military and political power throughout the world.
0x11e67a: But both were stopped by a lone hero...you, Solid Snake.
0x11e6c0: ..........
0x11e6d5: That was a long time ago....
0x11e70f: All the ICBM silos are closely monitored by military satellites.
0x11e75d: SLBM-equipped submarines can move secretly, but naturally they are limited to launching from the water.

0x11eb9d: With Metal Gear, governments of the world will be able to avoid this type of inspection,
0x11ec06: ...and at the same time stay in compliance with international nuclear treaties.
0x11ecc6: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x11ed3f: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x11ed88: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x11edf3: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x11ee78: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x11eedd: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x11ef43: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x11efc1: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x11f047: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x11f093: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x11f0e8: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x11f132: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x11f1ac: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x11f235: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x11f2db: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x11f344: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x11f38d: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x11f42b: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x11f4b2: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x11f52b: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x11f5ab: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x11f667: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x11f6e0: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x11f729: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?

0x1211c9: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x12127b: They were conducting exercises with this new Metal Gear prototype? Is that what the DARPA Chief said?
0x1212f1: Yeah.
0x121301: What the hell...!?
0x12131e: So you know about Metal Gear?
0x121346: Just rumors. I heard it is some kind of walking tank that can deliver an accurate nuclear strike from any terrain...mountains, deserts, swamps...
0x1213eb: ...wherever. But you are the real expert on Metal Gear, aren't you Snake?
0x121445: Yeah, I guess I am. But what about the PAL system that the DARPA Chief  mentioned?
0x1214a8: It is a device attached to a nuclear weapon system to prevent the missile from being armed or launched.
0x121520: Usually a secret detonation code or combination is necessary to launch the missile.
0x121584: According to the chief, there are two codes and the terrorists already know one of them.
0x1215ed: The other code...if the terrorists find out that one too...
0x121636: Yeah... I've got to hurry and rescue President Baker...
0x121699: PAL stands for "Permissive Action Link." It is a safety system attached to nuclear missile systems.
0x12170f: The missile cannot be fired without the insertion of a special electronic code.
0x12176f: But if the terrorists have found out the detonation codes, they can launch the missile anytime they want.
0x121807: Is it possible to destroy the PAL system so that the missile can be fired even without inserting the detonation code?
0x121890: I do not believe so.
0x1218af: It is set up so that the warhead will become automatically inactive if any attempt is made to remove, deactivate or destroy the PAL.
0x121947: So unless the terrorists either learn the detonation codes or get their hands on the detonation code override keys,
0x1219ce: ...there's no way they can launch...
0x1219fd: Do not be too sure. Any system can contain bugs or malfunctions. We cannot relax yet.
0x121a81: I do not know much about Metal Gear. Just the little I have heard.
0x121ad1: I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in 1995 and then again in Zanzibar in 1999...
0x121b32: Both were Third World countries led by military regimes.
0x121b78: They secretly developed Metal Gear to increase their military and political power throughout the world.
0x121bf0: But both were stopped by a lone hero...you, Solid Snake.
0x121c36: ..........
0x121c4b: That was a long time ago....
0x121c90: All the ICBM silos are closely monitored by military satellites.
0x121cde: SLBM-equipped submarines can move secretly, but naturally they are limited to launching from the water.
0x121d56: Finally, there are ALBMs which can be launched from aircraft. They allow for excellent mobility, but they are somewhat unreliable...
0x121dee: Metal Gear was developed to solve all those problems.
0x121e31: It can move freely over any terrain and independently launch a nuclear missile at any target in the world.
0x121eac: It completely changes the nature of the strategic arms race and destroys the delicate nuclear balance...It's  a weapon to be feared, believe me.
0x121f6e: The development of Metal Gear is a cynical attempt to consolidate and increase our military dominance...
0x121fe7: ...while at the same time maintaining the pretense of disarming ourselves.
0x12203f: Now that the SLCM zero option, allowing for the sneak inspections of submarines in international waters, has been concluded,
0x1220cf: ...the value of submarines as strategic weapons has been greatly diminished.
0x122129: With Metal Gear, governments of the world will be able to avoid this type of inspection,
0x122192: ...and at the same time stay in compliance with international nuclear treaties.
0x122210: PAL stands for "Permissive Action Link." It is a safety system attached to nuclear missile systems.
0x122286: The missile cannot be fired without the insertion of a special electronic code.
0x1222e6: But if the terrorists have found out the detonation codes, they can launch the missile anytime they want.
0x122373: Is it possible to destroy the PAL system so that the missile can be fired even without inserting the detonation code?
0x1223fc: I do not believe so.
0x12241b: It is set up so that the warhead will become automatically inactive if any attempt is made to remove, deactivate or destroy the PAL.
0x1224b3: So unless the terrorists either learn the detonation codes or get their hands on the detonation code override keys,
0x12253a: ...there's no way they can launch...
0x122569: Do not be too sure. Any system can contain bugs or malfunctions. We cannot relax yet.
0x1225e2: I do not know much about Metal Gear. Just the little I have heard.
0x122632: I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in 1995 and then again in Zanzibar in 1999...
0x122693: Both were Third World countries led by military regimes.
0x1226d9: They secretly developed Metal Gear to increase their military and political power throughout the world.
0x122751: But both were stopped by a lone hero...you, Solid Snake.
0x122797: ..........
0x1227ac: That was a long time ago....
0x1227e6: All the ICBM silos are closely monitored by military satellites.
0x122834: SLBM-equipped submarines can move secretly, but naturally they are limited to launching from the water.
0x1228ac: Finally, there are ALBMs which can be launched from aircraft. They allow for excellent mobility, but they are somewhat unreliable...
0x122944: Metal Gear was developed to solve all those problems.
0x122987: It can move freely over any terrain and independently launch a nuclear missile at any target in the world.
0x122a02: It completely changes the nature of the strategic arms race and destroys the delicate nuclear balance...It's  a weapon to be feared, believe me.
0x122ab9: The development of Metal Gear is a cynical attempt to consolidate and increase our military dominance...
0x122b32: ...while at the same time maintaining the pretense of disarming ourselves.

0x122c1a: ...the value of submarines as strategic weapons has been greatly diminished.
0x122c74: With Metal Gear, governments of the world will be able to avoid this type of inspection,
0x122cdd: ...and at the same time stay in compliance with international nuclear treaties.
0x122e0b: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x122e93: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x122ee0: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x122f29: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x122f77: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x122fe1: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x123072: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x12312b: You're a tough lady.
0x123150: You're a tough lady.
0x123171: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x1231bd: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x12321b: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x1232a3: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x123337: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1233c7: Same here, Snake.
0x1233dd: 7HNASTASHA
0x123474: That M1 tank is equipped with advanced vetronics. Once it locks on to a target, it automatically tracks it,
0x1234f3: and its main gun is effective up to 3000 meters.
0x123531: To get close, you'll have to confuse its tracking system. Use your Chaff.
0x123588: If you can jam the system and get close enough, it won't be able to use its main gun.
0x1235fa: Use your Chaff at a long distance to fool its electronic systems.
0x123677: Even if you can get close, the M1 tank's maximum speed is 45 miles per hour. First, you'll have to slow it down.
0x1236f8: Go after its caterpillars with C4 or Grenades.
0x123734: Once it slows down, toss a Grenade in the commander's turret.
0x12377f: The M1 has exceptionally strong armor.
0x1237b3: With your weapons, the only way to beat it is to attack the soldiers inside through the hatch.
0x12382e: Try to aim at the upper hatch with your grenades.
0x12389b: Use your Chaff at a long distance to fool its electronic systems.
0x1238fd: Try to aim at the upper hatch with your grenades.
0x123987: Look at him move! ...He must have some kind of powered exoskeleton.
0x1239fa: Powered exoskeleton? You mean like prosthetic arms and legs?
0x123a44: No. Prosthetics are intended to replace original body parts. That ninja's exoskeleton makes him far stronger than any normal human.
0x123adb: He is a true cyborg... a cybernetic organism.
0x123b16: So he's half machine, huh...?
0x123b3e: I heard rumors about the experiments, but I had no idea that such a creature really existed...
0x123bd1: Snake, to save Dr. Emmerich, you must defeat that ninja. Don't give up.
0x123c57: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x123ce6: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x123d5c: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x123de1: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x123e52: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x123e8f: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x123ef5: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x123f34: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x123fa0: You don't mean...
0x123fbc: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x124050: ..........
0x124065: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x1240e2: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x12411e: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x1241a2: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x124201: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x124250: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x1242ef: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x124365: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x1243ef: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x12446f: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x1244c6: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x12453b: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x124623: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x1246c0: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x12471f: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x1247b6: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x124826: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x12486c: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x1248db: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x12498e: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x124a17: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x124a73: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x124ae8: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x124bb4: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x124c4e: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x124c7d: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x124cd6: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x124dba: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x124e19: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x124ecd: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x124f5a: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x124fa4: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x12501d: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x125053: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x1250dc: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x12512a: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x1251d9: That is a FAMAS.
0x1251f4: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x125297: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x12535e: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x125382: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x1253c2: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x12543d: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x1254cf: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x12553d: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x125601: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x125671: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x1256ab: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x12573e: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x125796: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x125844: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x125899: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x12590f: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x1259a5: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x125a1f: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x125aa1: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x125ace: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x125b53: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x125b9a: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x125c37: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x125c77: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x125d60: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x125da3: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x125e0e: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x125e58: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x125ef5: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x125f72: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x126000: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x1260a0: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x1260fa: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x1261c5: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x126208: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x1262f4: A cardboard box.
0x12630f: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x1263a1: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x12642e: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x12649e: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x12653a: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x1265d3: wood or something.
0x1265f0: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x126657: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x126684: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x1266f3: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x126717: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x12679f: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x1267fc: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x12686a: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x1268bc: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x126971: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x126990: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x1269e5: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x126a5c: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x126aa9: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x126b35: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x126bb2: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x126c0d: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x126cd7: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x126d4d: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x126dcb: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x126dfd: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x126e91: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x126f35: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x126fdd: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x127017: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x127103: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x127156: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x12727c: It is just like Baker said. We are facing increasing danger from stored nuclear materials.
0x1272e7: You see, there are three elements necessary in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
0x12734a: Nuclear materials, nuclear engineers, and manufacturing technology.
0x12739b: All three of them can easily be acquired by either legal or illegal means. If you have enough money, that is.
0x12743a: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x127487: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x1274f2: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x127554: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.
0x127608: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x127695: That stands for "Material Unaccounted For."
0x1276d0: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.
0x127761: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x1277c4: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x127862: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...
0x127902: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x127993: They are big on the "nuclear deterrent" theory.
0x1279d2: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x127a6b: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...
0x127af3: ...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike. Those two probably feel that Metal Gear will further promote that security...
0x127b9a: The right-wingers believe that as long as any country has nuclear weapons, they must have them as well.
0x127c12: That is why they will never be in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x127c77: And with each new country that acquires nuclear capabilities, the need for maintaining that counterstrike threat increases.
0x127d06: As long as the nuclear deterrent policy continues, we'll never be rid of nuclear weapons...
0x127d90: The theory of nuclear deterrence was born during the Cold War, at a time of great suspicion between the US and the USSR.
0x127e1c: The great gulf between the ideologies of East and West caused a dramatic escalation in the arms race.
0x127e92: And this escalation of the arms race in turn fueled mutual distrust and fear between the world's two great superpowers.
0x127f1d: The last half of the 20th century was shaped by the policy of nuclear deterrence.
0x127f7f: But the world has changed.
0x127fa4: The Cold War has ended and we are now living in a world where small, regional conflicts are breaking out all over.
0x12802a: Things are not so simple anymore, and the policy of nuclear deterrence is obsolete.
0x12808e: Most of these regional conflicts are the result of age old enmities between different ethnic groups and religions.
0x128114: In those cases, the hatred often runs so deep that rationality is thrown out the window.
0x12817d: For people such as them, the fear of a counterstrike often means little and that is why the nuclear deterrence policy has lost much of its efficacy.
0x128225: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.
0x12829f: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x1282ec: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x128357: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x1283b9: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.
0x128462: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x1284ef: That stands for "Material Unaccounted For."
0x12852a: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.
0x1285b0: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x128613: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x1286b1: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...
0x128746: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x1287d7: They are big on the "nuclear deterrent" theory.
0x128816: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x1288af: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...
0x128937: ...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike. Those two probably feel that Metal Gear will further promote that security...
0x1289d3: The right-wingers believe that as long as any country has nuclear weapons, they must have them as well.
0x128a4b: That is why they will never be in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x128ab0: And with each new country that acquires nuclear capabilities, the need for maintaining that counterstrike threat increases.
0x128b3f: As long as the nuclear deterrent policy continues, we'll never be rid of nuclear weapons...
0x128bbe: The theory of nuclear deterrence was born during the Cold War, at a time of great suspicion between the US and the USSR.
0x128c4a: The great gulf between the ideologies of East and West caused a dramatic escalation in the arms race.
0x128cc0: And this escalation of the arms race in turn fueled mutual distrust and fear between the world's two great superpowers.
0x128d4b: The last half of the 20th century was shaped by the policy of nuclear deterrence.
0x128dad: But the world has changed.
0x128dd2: The Cold War has ended and we are now living in a world where small, regional conflicts are breaking out all over.
0x128e58: Things are not so simple anymore, and the policy of nuclear deterrence is obsolete.
0x128ebc: Most of these regional conflicts are the result of age old enmities between different ethnic groups and religions.
0x128f42: In those cases, the hatred often runs so deep that rationality is thrown out the window.
0x128fab: For people such as them, the fear of a counterstrike often means little and that is why the nuclear deterrence policy has lost much of its efficacy.
0x129053: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.
0x12910f: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x129188: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x1291d1: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x12923c: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x1292c1: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x129326: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x12938c: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x12940a: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x129490: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x1294dc: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x129531: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x12957b: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x1295f5: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x12967e: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x129724: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x12978d: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x1297d6: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x129874: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x1298fb: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x129974: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1299f4: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x129ab0: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x129b29: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x129b72: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?

0x12b592: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x12b612: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x12b6c4: It is just like Baker said. We are facing increasing danger from stored nuclear materials.
0x12b72f: You see, there are three elements necessary in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
0x12b792: Nuclear materials, nuclear engineers, and manufacturing technology.
0x12b7e3: All three of them can easily be acquired by either legal or illegal means. If you have enough money, that is.
0x12b882: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x12b8cf: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x12b93a: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x12b99c: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.
0x12ba50: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x12badd: That stands for "Material Unaccounted For."
0x12bb18: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.
0x12bba9: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x12bc0c: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x12bcaa: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...
0x12bd4a: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x12bddb: They are big on the "nuclear deterrent" theory.
0x12be1a: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x12beb3: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...

0x12d49b: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.
0x12d5c5: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x12d64d: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x12d69a: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x12d6e3: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x12d731: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x12d79b: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x12d82c: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x12d8e5: You're a tough lady.
0x12d90a: You're a tough lady.
0x12d92b: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x12d977: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x12d9d5: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x12da5d: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x12daf1: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x12db81: Same here, Snake.
0x12db97: 7HNASTASHA
0x12dc25: You found Meryl. Harasho!
0x12dc94: Meryl is acting kind of strange...
0x12dcc1: It could be the stress of battle. ...I have a friend who had "Chechan Syndrome."
0x12dd24: He became depressed six months after returning from Chechnya and  took his own life.
0x12dd89: He was forced to fight people who spoke his own language...people with his own culture. He couldn't live with the guilt of it...
0x12de1d: It sounds like PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.
0x12de5f: A lot of veterans returning from Vietnam suffered from that...in fact, many still do.
0x12dec5: Yes, it is also similar to the Afghan Syndrome. In Meryl's case, it is probably a much more short-term condition...
0x12df6a: Try to cheer her up. She'll come out of it.
0x12dfcb: Meryl is definitely not herself. Could she be dragged?
0x12e0b7: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x12e146: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x12e1bc: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x12e241: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x12e2b2: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x12e2ef: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x12e355: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x12e394: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x12e400: You don't mean...
0x12e41c: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x12e4b0: ..........
0x12e4c5: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x12e542: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x12e57e: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x12e602: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x12e661: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x12e6b0: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x12e74f: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x12e7c5: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x12e84f: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x12e8cf: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x12e926: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x12e99b: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x12ea83: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x12eb20: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x12eb7f: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x12ec16: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x12ec86: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x12eccc: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x12ed3b: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x12edee: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x12ee77: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x12eed3: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x12ef48: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x12f014: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x12f0ae: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x12f0dd: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x12f136: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x12f21a: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x12f279: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x12f32d: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x12f3ba: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x12f404: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x12f47d: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x12f4b3: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x12f53c: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x12f58a: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x12f639: That is a FAMAS.
0x12f654: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x12f6f7: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x12f7be: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x12f7e2: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x12f822: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x12f89d: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x12f92f: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x12f99d: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x12fa61: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x12fad1: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x12fb0b: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x12fb9e: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x12fbf6: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x12fca4: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x12fcf9: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x12fd6f: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x12fe05: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x12fe7f: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x12ff01: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x12ff2e: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x12ffb3: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x12fffa: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x130097: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x1300d7: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x1301c0: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x130203: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x13026e: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x1302b8: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x130355: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x1303d2: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x130460: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x130500: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x13055a: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x130625: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x130668: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x130754: A cardboard box.
0x13076f: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x130801: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x13088e: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x1308fe: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x13099a: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x130a33: wood or something.
0x130a50: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x130ab7: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x130ae4: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x130b53: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x130b77: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x130bff: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x130c5c: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x130cca: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x130d1c: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x130dd1: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x130df0: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x130e45: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x130ebc: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x130f09: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x130f95: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x131012: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x13106d: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x131137: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x1311ad: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x13122b: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x13125d: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x1312f1: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x131395: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x13143d: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x131477: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x131563: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x1315b6: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x1316dc: Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation...
0x13175a: ...without ever exploding a nuclear device. Is that true?
0x1317a1: Yes, it is true. Since the establishment of DARHT, (the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility),
0x13181d: and NIF, (the National Ignition Facility) early in the 21st century, there has been a wealth of data concerning nuclear fission and fusion.
0x1318bc: There is also much data accumulated from the nuclear tests conducted over the last four decades.
0x13192d: With the processing speed of today's supercomputers, they can design a new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer simulations.
0x1319e6: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x131a5e: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x131af7: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x131b4a: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x131bf0: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x131c99: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x131cfd: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.
0x131d5f: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x131dd1: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x131e5a: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x131edc: ...but that is nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x131f20: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x131f87: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear weapons.
0x132009: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.
0x1320a8: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?
0x132103: That was the secret World War II project responsible for the creation of the first atomic bomb.
0x132173: It had a huge budget, something like two billion dollars. They brought in 120,000 of the best and brightest scientists and engineers to work on it.
0x13221a: And we all know how that story ended.
0x13224a: In July of 1945, they exploded the first nuclear device at Trinity, followed shortly after by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x1322d3: Trinity...the world was changed forever that day. Scientists and researchers could no longer pretend that their hands were clean of blood.
0x132371: Afterwards, the leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, said:
0x1323d0: "The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose."
0x132450: When Dr. Emmerich designed the new Metal Gear prototype, he thought he was creating a mobile TMD system. He is a very naive man.
0x1324e4: TMD stands for "Theater Missile Defense."
0x13251d: They represent a shift in defense priorities from dealing with the threat of ICBMs from the former Soviet Union,
0x1325a1: ...to dealing with small scale regional conflicts in the Third World.
0x1325f4: Current TMD systems work by a combination of THAADs, theater high altitude air defense, which intercept missiles outside of the atmosphere,
0x132693: and Patriot-type missiles which intercept missiles within the atmosphere.
0x1326ed: Dr. Emmerich was planning on them using Metal Gear as a low atmosphere mobile missile interceptor unit.
0x132783: There are many in Russia as well as America who are opposed to TMD systems...
0x1327e1: ...because they say that it undermines the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
0x132852: And there are also those who say that  the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over from the Cold War.
0x1328c3: They argue that the strategy of MAD (mutually assured destruction) should be maintained by limiting missile defense systems.
0x132953: There was a big debate over it, but ultimately, under pressure from the Defense Industry who was looking to expand into new markets,
0x1329eb: TMD systems were accepted as  an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x132a66: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x132ade: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.

0x133112: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?

0x133a3f: TMD systems were accepted as  an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x133afc: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x133b75: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x133bbe: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x133c29: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x133cae: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x133d13: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x133d79: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x133df7: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x133e7d: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x133ec9: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x133f1e: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x133f68: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x133fe2: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x13406b: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x134111: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x13417a: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x1341c3: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x134261: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x1342e8: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x134361: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1343e1: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x13449d: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x134516: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x13455f: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x1345ca: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.

0x13713f: TMD systems were accepted as  an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x1371f1: It is just like Baker said. We are facing increasing danger from stored nuclear materials.
0x13725c: You see, there are three elements necessary in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
0x1372bf: Nuclear materials, nuclear engineers, and manufacturing technology.
0x137310: All three of them can easily be acquired by either legal or illegal means. If you have enough money, that is.
0x1373af: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x1373fc: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x137467: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x1374c9: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.
0x13757d: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x13760a: That stands for "Material Unaccounted For."
0x137645: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.
0x1376d6: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x137739: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x1377d7: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...
0x137877: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x137908: They are big on the "nuclear deterrent" theory.
0x137947: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x1379e0: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...
0x137a68: ...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike. Those two probably feel that Metal Gear will further promote that security...
0x137b0f: The right-wingers believe that as long as any country has nuclear weapons, they must have them as well.
0x137b87: That is why they will never be in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x137bec: And with each new country that acquires nuclear capabilities, the need for maintaining that counterstrike threat increases.
0x137c7b: As long as the nuclear deterrent policy continues, we'll never be rid of nuclear weapons...
0x137d05: The theory of nuclear deterrence was born during the Cold War, at a time of great suspicion between the US and the USSR.
0x137d91: The great gulf between the ideologies of East and West caused a dramatic escalation in the arms race.
0x137e07: And this escalation of the arms race in turn fueled mutual distrust and fear between the world's two great superpowers.
0x137e92: The last half of the 20th century was shaped by the policy of nuclear deterrence.
0x137ef4: But the world has changed.
0x137f19: The Cold War has ended and we are now living in a world where small, regional conflicts are breaking out all over.
0x137f9f: Things are not so simple anymore, and the policy of nuclear deterrence is obsolete.
0x138003: Most of these regional conflicts are the result of age old enmities between different ethnic groups and religions.
0x138089: In those cases, the hatred often runs so deep that rationality is thrown out the window.
0x1380f2: For people such as them, the fear of a counterstrike often means little and that is why the nuclear deterrence policy has lost much of its efficacy.
0x13819a: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.
0x138214: They say that there are 500,000 nuclear engineers in the world.
0x138261: But after the end of the Cold War, the demand for nuclear engineers dropped precipitously.
0x1382cc: In the Eastern Block countries, in particular, there is a tremendous brain drain.
0x13832e: They cannot keep their scientists in the country, and each year more and more nuclear engineers go to work for the highest bidder.
0x1383d7: Just like Baker said, each year there are more and more cases of MUF coming from the nuclear material storage facilities.
0x138464: That stands for "Material Unaccounted For."
0x13849f: It means that someone is stealing nuclear materials and probably selling them on the black market.
0x138525: After the fall of the Soviet Union, the nuclear management program fell to pieces.
0x138588: In the late 1990's, there were rumors that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized nuclear bombs mysteriously disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.
0x138626: We still do not know whether it is true or not, but it is possible that they fell into the hands of terrorists...
0x1386bb: It looks like the DARPA chief and the ArmsTech president both agree on the concept of maintaining a dominant nuclear arsenal.
0x13874c: They are big on the "nuclear deterrent" theory.
0x13878b: The idea behind a nuclear standoff is that both countries would be too afraid to use a nuclear weapon for fear of a nuclear reprisal.
0x138824: In other words, the only thing preventing a country from totally devastating another country with nuclear weapons...
0x1388ac: ...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike. Those two probably feel that Metal Gear will further promote that security...
0x138948: The right-wingers believe that as long as any country has nuclear weapons, they must have them as well.
0x1389c0: That is why they will never be in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x138a25: And with each new country that acquires nuclear capabilities, the need for maintaining that counterstrike threat increases.
0x138ab4: As long as the nuclear deterrent policy continues, we'll never be rid of nuclear weapons...
0x138b33: The theory of nuclear deterrence was born during the Cold War, at a time of great suspicion between the US and the USSR.
0x138bbf: The great gulf between the ideologies of East and West caused a dramatic escalation in the arms race.
0x138c35: And this escalation of the arms race in turn fueled mutual distrust and fear between the world's two great superpowers.
0x138cc0: The last half of the 20th century was shaped by the policy of nuclear deterrence.
0x138d22: But the world has changed.
0x138d47: The Cold War has ended and we are now living in a world where small, regional conflicts are breaking out all over.
0x138dcd: Things are not so simple anymore, and the policy of nuclear deterrence is obsolete.
0x138e31: Most of these regional conflicts are the result of age old enmities between different ethnic groups and religions.
0x138eb7: In those cases, the hatred often runs so deep that rationality is thrown out the window.
0x138f20: For people such as them, the fear of a counterstrike often means little and that is why the nuclear deterrence policy has lost much of its efficacy.
0x138fc8: A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient deterrent in the current world climate.
0x139626: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1396ae: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1396fb: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x139744: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x139792: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x1397fc: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x13988d: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x139946: You're a tough lady.
0x13996b: You're a tough lady.
0x13998c: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x1399d8: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x139a36: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x139abe: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x139b52: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x139be2: Same here, Snake.
0x139bf8: 7HNASTASHA
0x139c86: Snake, you cannot win without a sniper rifle...you cannot save the girl either.
0x139ce3: Find a sniper rifle. It is the only way to save Meryl.
0x139d56: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x139de5: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x139e5b: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x139ee0: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x139f51: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x139f8e: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x139ff4: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x13a033: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x13a09f: You don't mean...
0x13a0bb: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x13a14f: ..........
0x13a164: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x13a1e1: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x13a21d: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x13a2a1: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x13a300: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x13a34f: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x13a3ee: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x13a464: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x13a4ee: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x13a56e: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x13a5c5: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x13a63a: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x13a722: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x13a7bf: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x13a81e: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x13a8b5: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x13a925: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x13a96b: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x13a9da: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x13aa8d: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x13ab16: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x13ab72: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x13abe7: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x13acb3: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x13ad4d: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x13ad7c: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x13add5: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x13aeb9: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x13af18: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x13afcc: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x13b059: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x13b0a3: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x13b11c: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x13b152: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x13b1db: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x13b229: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x13b2d8: That is a FAMAS.
0x13b2f3: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x13b396: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x13b45d: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x13b481: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x13b4c1: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x13b53c: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x13b5ce: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x13b63c: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x13b700: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x13b770: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x13b7aa: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x13b83d: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x13b895: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x13b943: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x13b998: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x13ba0e: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x13baa4: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x13bb1e: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x13bba0: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x13bbcd: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x13bc52: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x13bc99: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x13bd36: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x13bd76: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x13be5f: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x13bea2: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x13bf0d: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x13bf57: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x13bff4: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x13c071: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x13c0ff: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x13c19f: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x13c1f9: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x13c2c4: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x13c307: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x13c3f3: A cardboard box.
0x13c40e: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x13c4a0: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x13c52d: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x13c59d: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x13c639: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x13c6d2: wood or something.
0x13c6ef: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x13c756: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x13c783: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x13c7f2: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x13c816: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x13c89e: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x13c8fb: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x13c969: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x13c9bb: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x13ca70: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x13ca8f: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x13cae4: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x13cb5b: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x13cba8: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x13cc34: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x13ccb1: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x13cd0c: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x13cdd6: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x13ce4c: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x13ceca: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x13cefc: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x13cf90: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x13d034: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x13d0dc: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x13d116: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x13d202: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x13d255: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x13d37b: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x13d441: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x13d4b8: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x13d51b: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x13d5ca: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x13d624: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x13d6bf: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x13d733: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x13d7d0: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x13d870: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x13d8eb: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x13d96b: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x13da26: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x13da9d: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x13db00: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x13dba4: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x13dbfe: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x13dc99: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x13dd0d: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x13dd9f: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x13de3f: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x13deba: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x13df7c: Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation...
0x13dffa: ...without ever exploding a nuclear device. Is that true?
0x13e041: Yes, it is true. Since the establishment of DARHT, (the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility),
0x13e0bd: and NIF, (the National Ignition Facility) early in the 21st century, there has been a wealth of data concerning nuclear fission and fusion.
0x13e15c: There is also much data accumulated from the nuclear tests conducted over the last four decades.
0x13e1cd: With the processing speed of today's supercomputers, they can design a new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer simulations.
0x13e286: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x13e2fe: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x13e397: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x13e3ea: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x13e490: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x13e539: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x13e59d: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.
0x13e5ff: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x13e671: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x13e6fa: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x13e77c: ...but that is nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x13e7c0: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x13e827: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear weapons.
0x13e8a9: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.
0x13e948: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?
0x13e9a3: That was the secret World War II project responsible for the creation of the first atomic bomb.
0x13ea13: It had a huge budget, something like two billion dollars. They brought in 120,000 of the best and brightest scientists and engineers to work on it.
0x13eaba: And we all know how that story ended.
0x13eaea: In July of 1945, they exploded the first nuclear device at Trinity, followed shortly after by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x13eb73: Trinity...the world was changed forever that day. Scientists and researchers could no longer pretend that their hands were clean of blood.
0x13ec11: Afterwards, the leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, said:
0x13ec70: "The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose."
0x13ecf0: When Dr. Emmerich designed the new Metal Gear prototype, he thought he was creating a mobile TMD system. He is a very naive man.
0x13ed84: TMD stands for "Theater Missile Defense."
0x13edbd: They represent a shift in defense priorities from dealing with the threat of ICBMs from the former Soviet Union,
0x13ee41: ...to dealing with small scale regional conflicts in the Third World.
0x13ee94: Current TMD systems work by a combination of THAADs, theater high altitude air defense, which intercept missiles outside of the atmosphere,
0x13ef33: and Patriot-type missiles which intercept missiles within the atmosphere.
0x13ef8d: Dr. Emmerich was planning on them using Metal Gear as a low atmosphere mobile missile interceptor unit.
0x13f023: There are many in Russia as well as America who are opposed to TMD systems...
0x13f081: ...because they say that it undermines the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
0x13f0f2: And there are also those who say that  the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over from the Cold War.
0x13f163: They argue that the strategy of MAD (mutually assured destruction) should be maintained by limiting missile defense systems.
0x13f1f3: There was a big debate over it, but ultimately, under pressure from the Defense Industry who was looking to expand into new markets,
0x13f28b: TMD systems were accepted as  an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x13f306: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x13f37e: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x13f417: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x13f46a: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x13f510: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x13f5b9: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x13f61d: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.
0x13f674: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x13f6e6: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x13f76f: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x13f7f1: ...but that is nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x13f835: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x13f89c: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear weapons.
0x13f91e: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.
0x13f9b2: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?
0x13fa0d: That was the secret World War II project responsible for the creation of the first atomic bomb.
0x13fa7d: It had a huge budget, something like two billion dollars. They brought in 120,000 of the best and brightest scientists and engineers to work on it.
0x13fb24: And we all know how that story ended.
0x13fb54: In July of 1945, they exploded the first nuclear device at Trinity, followed shortly after by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x13fbdd: Trinity...the world was changed forever that day. Scientists and researchers could no longer pretend that their hands were clean of blood.
0x13fc7b: Afterwards, the leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, said:
0x13fcda: "The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose."
0x13fd4f: When Dr. Emmerich designed the new Metal Gear prototype, he thought he was creating a mobile TMD system. He is a very naive man.
0x13fde3: TMD stands for "Theater Missile Defense."
0x13fe1c: They represent a shift in defense priorities from dealing with the threat of ICBMs from the former Soviet Union,
0x13fea0: ...to dealing with small scale regional conflicts in the Third World.
0x13fef3: Current TMD systems work by a combination of THAADs, theater high altitude air defense, which intercept missiles outside of the atmosphere,
0x13ff92: and Patriot-type missiles which intercept missiles within the atmosphere.
0x13ffec: Dr. Emmerich was planning on them using Metal Gear as a low atmosphere mobile missile interceptor unit.
0x140077: There are many in Russia as well as America who are opposed to TMD systems...
0x1400d5: ...because they say that it undermines the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
0x140146: And there are also those who say that  the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over from the Cold War.
0x1401b7: They argue that the strategy of MAD (mutually assured destruction) should be maintained by limiting missile defense systems.
0x140247: There was a big debate over it, but ultimately, under pressure from the Defense Industry who was looking to expand into new markets,
0x1402df: TMD systems were accepted as  an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x14039c: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x140462: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x1404d9: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x14053c: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x1405eb: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x140645: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x1406e0: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x140754: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x1407f1: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x140891: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x14090c: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x14098c: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x140a47: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x140abe: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x140b21: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x140bc5: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x140c1f: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x140cba: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x140d2e: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x140dc0: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x140e60: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x140edb: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x140f92: Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation...
0x141010: ...without ever exploding a nuclear device. Is that true?
0x141057: Yes, it is true. Since the establishment of DARHT, (the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility),
0x1410d3: and NIF, (the National Ignition Facility) early in the 21st century, there has been a wealth of data concerning nuclear fission and fusion.
0x141172: There is also much data accumulated from the nuclear tests conducted over the last four decades.
0x1411e3: With the processing speed of today's supercomputers, they can design a new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer simulations.
0x14129c: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x141314: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x1413ad: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x141400: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x1414a6: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x14154f: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x1415b3: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.
0x141615: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x141687: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x141710: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x141792: ...but that is nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x1417d6: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x14183d: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear weapons.
0x1418bf: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.
0x14195e: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?

0x1432f5: TMD systems were accepted as  an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x143420: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1434a8: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1434f5: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x14353e: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x14358c: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x1435f6: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x143687: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x143740: You're a tough lady.
0x143765: You're a tough lady.
0x143786: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x1437d2: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x143830: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x1438b8: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x14394c: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1439dc: Same here, Snake.
0x1439f2: 7HNASTASHA
0x143a86: That was a close one. I didn't think they would go so far as to booby trap your equipment. ...sneaky bastards.
0x143b4b: When you're in a dark place,  you should use Night-Vision or Thermal Goggles.
0x143bf1: To beat that Hind, you need a SAM,  a surface to air missile.
0x143c3c: You cannot shoot it down with just small arms fire. If only you had a Stinger...
0x143cb0: Only a handful of pilots in the world could operate a Hind in a blizzard  like this.
0x143d15: The IR and night-vision equipment would be useless. He must be flying on manual. That means your Chaff won't work.
0x143daf: To beat that Hind, you need a SAM,  a surface to air missile.
0x143dfa: You cannot shoot it down with just small arms fire. If only you had a Stinger...
0x143eb8: The Hind is still around. You'll need a surface to air missile to take him on. Like a Stinger or something...
0x143f58: You have Stinger missiles. Now you have at least got a chance against the Hind...
0x143fd9: Only a chance?
0x143ff2: Well you are not exactly evenly armed.
0x144026: That Hind is a monster. You have only a small chance to win, but at least it's better than no chance...
0x14409e: That's a pretty grim analysis, Nastasha.
0x1440d4: To shoot down that Hind, you will have to get to a place with good visibility.
0x144133: Do not try to fight in that walkway. Get up on that roof where you will have a clean shot at him.
0x14421e: Your best chance is to hit him while  he is circling, when his nose isn't pointed at you. That is your opening. Shove a Stinger missile up his butt!
0x1442f4: That machine gun can rip you to shreds in seconds.
0x144334: When it is facing in your direction, you'd better hide in the shadows up there.
0x1443b2: You cannot move while operating your Stinger missile.
0x1443f5: Focus your sights on that bird as soon as it shows its tail. When its gun turret is aimed at you, quickly hide in the shadows.
0x144487: Use your R1 Button effectively.
0x1444cf: That Hind is equipped with infrared and night-vision equipment. It can fly even in pitch darkness. But there's one thing...
0x14456a: Only a handful of pilots in the world could operate a Hind in a blizzard  like this.
0x1445cf: The IR and night-vision equipment would be useless. He must be flying on manual. That means your Chaff won't work.
0x14467f: Your best chance is to hit him while  he is circling, when his nose isn't pointed at you. That is your opening. Shove a Stinger missile up his butt!
0x14474a: That machine gun can rip you to shreds in seconds.
0x14478a: When it is facing in your direction, you'd better hide in the shadows up there.
0x1447fd: You cannot move while operating your Stinger missile.
0x144840: Focus your sights on that bird as soon as it shows its tail. When its gun turret is aimed at you, quickly hide in the shadows.
0x1448d2: Use your R1 Button effectively.
0x14490f: That Hind is equipped with infrared and night-vision equipment. It can fly even in pitch darkness. But there's one thing...
0x1449aa: Only a handful of pilots in the world could operate a Hind in a blizzard  like this.
0x144a0f: The IR and night-vision equipment would be useless. He must be flying on manual. That means your Chaff won't work.
0x144abb: You have Stinger missiles. Now you have at least got a chance against the Hind...
0x144b3c: Only a chance?
0x144b55: Well you are not exactly evenly armed.
0x144b89: That Hind is a monster. You have only a small chance to win, but at least it's better than no chance...
0x144c01: That's a pretty grim analysis, Nastasha.
0x144c37: To shoot down that Hind, you will have to get to a place with good visibility.
0x144c96: Do not try to fight in that walkway. Get up on that roof where you will have a clean shot at him.
0x144d4b: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x144dda: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x144e50: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x144ed5: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x144f46: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x144f83: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x144fe9: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x145028: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x145094: You don't mean...
0x1450b0: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x145144: ..........
0x145159: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x1451d6: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x145212: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x145296: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x1452f5: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x145344: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x1453e3: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x145459: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x1454e3: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x145563: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x1455ba: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x14562f: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x145717: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x1457b4: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x145813: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x1458aa: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x14591a: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x145960: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x1459cf: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x145a82: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x145b0b: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x145b67: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x145bdc: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x145ca8: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x145d42: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x145d71: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x145dca: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x145eae: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x145f0d: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x145fc1: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x14604e: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x146098: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x146111: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x146147: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x1461d0: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x14621e: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x1462cd: That is a FAMAS.
0x1462e8: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x14638b: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x146452: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x146476: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x1464b6: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x146531: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x1465c3: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x146631: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x1466f5: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x146765: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x14679f: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x146832: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x14688a: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x146938: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x14698d: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x146a03: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x146a99: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x146b13: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x146b95: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x146bc2: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x146c47: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x146c8e: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x146d2b: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x146d6b: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x146e54: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x146e97: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x146f02: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x146f4c: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x146fe9: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x147066: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x1470f4: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x147194: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x1471ee: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x1472b9: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x1472fc: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x1473e8: A cardboard box.
0x147403: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x147495: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x147522: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x147592: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x14762e: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x1476c7: wood or something.
0x1476e4: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x14774b: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x147778: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x1477e7: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x14780b: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x147893: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x1478f0: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x14795e: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x1479b0: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x147a65: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x147a84: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x147ad9: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x147b50: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x147b9d: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x147c29: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x147ca6: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x147d01: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x147dcb: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x147e41: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x147ebf: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x147ef1: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x147f85: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x148029: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x1480d1: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x14810b: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x1481f7: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x14824a: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x148370: So the terrorist's intentionally set their deadline to coincide with the signing of the START 3 Accord...
0x1483ea: According to the terms of START 3, both Russia and the U.S. are to reduce the number...
0x148452: ...of their nuclear warheads in deployment to between 2,000 and 2,500 missiles.
0x1484b2: The current President has not yet had any major foreign policy successes.
0x148509: His term will be up soon and the word at the White House is that he desperately wants this one for the history books.
0x148592: Typical politician...
0x1485b2: It is a big concern for him and his supporters.
0x14860d: The signing of the START 3 was dependent on ratification of the START 2.
0x148666: But MIRVs were the most important weapon in Russian arsenal.
0x1486b0: Naturally, the conservatives in the Russian Parliament were greatly opposed to disarming them.
0x14871f: The expansion of NATO, along with tension caused by disagreements...
0x148771: over the application of the ABM Treaty with regards to TMD systems made ratification in the 1990's difficult.
0x1487ef: It took a tremendous amount of pressure and secret negotiations to get the Russians to sign the START 3 tomorrow.
0x148874: But the political situation in Russia is tenuous at best and one small incident could bring the signing to a crashing halt.
0x148903: If the Russians learn that America has secretly developed a new type of nuclear weapon, there is no telling how they might react.
0x148998: World opinion will be strongly against us too.
0x1489d4: That Liquid Snake is a smart one...he knows the political climate. His actions were obviously very well calculated...
0x148a78: It is true that the signing of START 3 would mean a reduction in nuclear missiles,
0x148adb: but it would still leave between 4,000 to 5,000 missiles between the US and Russia alone.
0x148b45: That is more than enough to destroy every living thing on this planet several times over.
0x148baf: There is a big difference between nuclear reduction and nuclear elimination.
0x148c2a: Negotiations for START 3 began in the late 1990's.
0x148c6a: The Russian President had actually been pushing for a much more ambitious arms reduction pact, but it was rejected by the Americans.
0x148d02: America was the sole remaining superpower on the Earth and they were not too eager to give up the title.
0x148d7b: The fact is in the history of the world, no dominant power has ever willingly given up the reigns of that power.
0x148dfc: ...in the case of the US, that means nuclear superiority.
0x148e61: There has been a lot of effort to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons,...
0x148ec6: but even today, there is no treaty limiting tactical nuclear weapons.
0x148f19: It may look from the outside that the world is disarming, but in fact nuclear weapons are not going anywhere soon.
0x148fba: The Nuclear Age is not over yet. As long as one country in the world has nuclear weapons, they will never go away.
0x14905e: The signing of the START 3 was dependent on ratification of the START 2.
0x1490b7: But MIRVs were the most important weapon in Russian arsenal.
0x149101: Naturally, the conservatives in the Russian Parliament were greatly opposed to disarming them.
0x149170: The expansion of NATO, along with tension caused by disagreements...
0x1491c2: over the application of the ABM Treaty with regards to TMD systems made ratification in the 1990's difficult.

0x1492c5: But the political situation in Russia is tenuous at best and one small incident could bring the signing to a crashing halt.
0x149354: If the Russians learn that America has secretly developed a new type of nuclear weapon, there is no telling how they might react.
0x1493e9: World opinion will be strongly against us too.
0x149425: That Liquid Snake is a smart one...he knows the political climate. His actions were obviously very well calculated...
0x1494be: It is true that the signing of START 3 would mean a reduction in nuclear missiles,
0x149521: but it would still leave between 4,000 to 5,000 missiles between the US and Russia alone.
0x14958b: That is more than enough to destroy every living thing on this planet several times over.
0x1495f5: There is a big difference between nuclear reduction and nuclear elimination.
0x149665: Negotiations for START 3 began in the late 1990's.
0x1496a5: The Russian President had actually been pushing for a much more ambitious arms reduction pact, but it was rejected by the Americans.
0x14973d: America was the sole remaining superpower on the Earth and they were not too eager to give up the title.
0x1497b6: The fact is in the history of the world, no dominant power has ever willingly given up the reigns of that power.
0x149837: ...in the case of the US, that means nuclear superiority.
0x149891: There has been a lot of effort to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons,...
0x1498f6: but even today, there is no treaty limiting tactical nuclear weapons.
0x149949: It may look from the outside that the world is disarming, but in fact nuclear weapons are not going anywhere soon.
0x1499df: The Nuclear Age is not over yet. As long as one country in the world has nuclear weapons, they will never go away.
0x149ac5: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x149b8b: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x149c02: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x149c65: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x149d14: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x149d6e: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x149e09: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x149e7d: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x149f1a: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x149fba: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x14a035: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x14a0b5: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x14a170: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x14a1e7: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x14a24a: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x14a2ee: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x14a348: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x14a3e3: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...

0x14a589: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x14a604: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x14a6c6: Otacon said that now it's possible to design and test new types of nuclear weapons in a virtual simulation...
0x14a744: ...without ever exploding a nuclear device. Is that true?
0x14a78b: Yes, it is true. Since the establishment of DARHT, (the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility),
0x14a807: and NIF, (the National Ignition Facility) early in the 21st century, there has been a wealth of data concerning nuclear fission and fusion.
0x14a8a6: There is also much data accumulated from the nuclear tests conducted over the last four decades.
0x14a917: With the processing speed of today's supercomputers, they can design a new nuclear weapon through virtual reality computer simulations.
0x14a9d0: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x14aa48: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.
0x14aae1: They then measure the effect that the shockwave has on the plutonium.
0x14ab34: By measuring the particles which fly off the surface of the plutonium, they can learn the mass, speed and distribution of the plutonium particles.
0x14abda: The politicians insist that whether it is above ground or below ground, a nuclear test which does not cause a nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test
0x14ac83: ...and therefore does not violate the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty).
0x14ace7: A lot of people do not agree with that interpretation.
0x14ad49: The first sub-critical test was performed on July 2, 1997 at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.
0x14adbb: After that, sub-critical testing became extremely common, not only in America, but in Russia and other countries too.
0x14ae44: They say that the reason for the tests is to ensure the safety and reliability of the existing nuclear stockpile,
0x14aec6: ...but that is nothing more than a flimsy cover story.
0x14af0a: In reality, the danger of a nuclear weapon exploding accidentally decreases over time.
0x14af71: It is clear that the real reason for these tests is to aid in the development of new types of nuclear weapons.
0x14aff3: Even the government admits that the data collected from those tests is used in virtual reality simulation tests.
0x14b092: That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father participated in the Manhattan Project?
0x14b0ed: That was the secret World War II project responsible for the creation of the first atomic bomb.
0x14b15d: It had a huge budget, something like two billion dollars. They brought in 120,000 of the best and brightest scientists and engineers to work on it.
0x14b204: And we all know how that story ended.
0x14b234: In July of 1945, they exploded the first nuclear device at Trinity, followed shortly after by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x14b2bd: Trinity...the world was changed forever that day. Scientists and researchers could no longer pretend that their hands were clean of blood.
0x14b35b: Afterwards, the leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, said:
0x14b3ba: "The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose."
0x14b43a: When Dr. Emmerich designed the new Metal Gear prototype, he thought he was creating a mobile TMD system. He is a very naive man.
0x14b4ce: TMD stands for "Theater Missile Defense."
0x14b507: They represent a shift in defense priorities from dealing with the threat of ICBMs from the former Soviet Union,
0x14b58b: ...to dealing with small scale regional conflicts in the Third World.
0x14b5de: Current TMD systems work by a combination of THAADs, theater high altitude air defense, which intercept missiles outside of the atmosphere,
0x14b67d: and Patriot-type missiles which intercept missiles within the atmosphere.
0x14b6d7: Dr. Emmerich was planning on them using Metal Gear as a low atmosphere mobile missile interceptor unit.
0x14b76d: There are many in Russia as well as America who are opposed to TMD systems...
0x14b7cb: ...because they say that it undermines the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
0x14b83c: And there are also those who say that  the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over from the Cold War.
0x14b8ad: They argue that the strategy of MAD (mutually assured destruction) should be maintained by limiting missile defense systems.
0x14b93d: There was a big debate over it, but ultimately, under pressure from the Defense Industry who was looking to expand into new markets,
0x14b9d5: TMD systems were accepted as  an integral part of a modern military arsenal.
0x14ba50: In order to collect data for the simulation experiments, they are doing sub-critical tests underground.
0x14bac8: Those are experiments in which they detonate high explosives in proximity to plutonium without setting off a critical chain reaction.

0x14e230: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x14e2f6: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x14e36d: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.

0x14ecf4: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x14ed6f: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x14ee9f: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x14ef27: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x14ef74: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x14efbd: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x14f00b: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x14f075: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x14f106: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x14f1bf: You're a tough lady.
0x14f1e4: You're a tough lady.
0x14f205: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x14f251: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x14f2af: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x14f337: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x14f3cb: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x14f45b: Same here, Snake.
0x14f471: 7HNASTASHA
0x14f4ff: My God, you actually shot down that Hind...
0x14f553: You're the one who said I could do it with a Stinger. ...You didn't really think I had a chance, did you?
0x14f5d0: It is not that...
0x14f5fa: Well after all, that Hind shot down two F-16s.
0x14f636: It is hard to believe that after doing that it got taken out by just one man...nice going, Snake.
0x14f6f3: Stealth camouflage?  Yes. That is the new material, recently  developed, which hides a person's  body by bending light.
0x14f77e: I think you should ask the person who invented it.
0x14f7e3: Use the Thermal Goggles like Dr. Emmerich said.
0x14f832: If you don't have Thermal Goggles,  there is not much you can do.
0x14f881: Try to watch for a faint disturbance  in the air. That's where your stealth soldiers are.
0x14f917: Snake, to get to the underground base, you have to get past the snowfield where Sniper Wolf is waiting.
0x14f992: You will have to take care of her to complete your mission.
0x14fa16: It looks like, Raven's holding an M61A1 20 mm. multi-turreted machine gun. They're usually mounted on F16s.
0x14fa92: With its 6 rotating turrets, it can fire 4000 20 mm. rounds per minute. And it's accurate, too.
0x14fb02: If you come at him from the front he will turn you into borscht.
0x14fb72: Stay out of his way. You have to hide and attack. Try a Remote Controlled Missile or your C4 explosives.
0x14fc1f: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x14fcae: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x14fd24: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x14fda9: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x14fe1a: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x14fe57: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x14febd: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x14fefc: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x14ff68: You don't mean...
0x14ff84: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x150018: ..........
0x15002d: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x1500aa: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x1500e6: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x15016a: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x1501c9: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x150218: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x1502b7: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x15032d: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x1503b7: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x150437: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x15048e: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x150503: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x1505eb: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x150688: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x1506e7: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x15077e: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x1507ee: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x150834: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x1508a3: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x150956: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x1509df: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x150a3b: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x150ab0: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x150b7c: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x150c16: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x150c45: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x150c9e: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x150d82: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x150de1: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x150e95: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x150f22: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x150f6c: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x150fe5: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x15101b: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x1510a4: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x1510f2: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x1511a1: That is a FAMAS.
0x1511bc: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x15125f: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x151326: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x15134a: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x15138a: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x151405: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x151497: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x151505: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x1515c9: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x151639: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x151673: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x151706: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x15175e: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x15180c: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x151861: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x1518d7: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x15196d: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x1519e7: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x151a69: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x151a96: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x151b1b: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x151b62: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x151bff: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x151c3f: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x151d28: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x151d6b: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x151dd6: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x151e20: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x151ebd: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x151f3a: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x151fc8: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x152068: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x1520c2: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x15218d: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x1521d0: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x1522bc: A cardboard box.
0x1522d7: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x152369: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x1523f6: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x152466: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x152502: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x15259b: wood or something.
0x1525b8: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x15261f: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x15264c: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x1526bb: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x1526df: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x152767: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x1527c4: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x152832: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x152884: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x152939: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x152958: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x1529ad: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x152a24: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x152a71: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x152afd: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x152b7a: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x152bd5: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x152c9f: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x152d15: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x152d93: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x152dc5: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x152e59: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x152efd: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x152fa5: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x152fdf: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x1530cb: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x15311e: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x153231: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x1532c0: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x153336: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x1533bb: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x15342c: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x153469: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x1534cf: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x15350e: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x15357a: You don't mean...
0x153596: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x15362a: ..........
0x15363f: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x1536bc: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x1536f8: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x15377c: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x1537db: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x15382a: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x1538cc: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x153929: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x1539c1: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,
0x153a59: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x153afc: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.
0x153b93: There is no doubt about it. After the Cold War ended, the chance of a full-scale world-wide nuclear conflagration was diminished.
0x153c28: But on the other hand, the chances of local, tactical use of nuclear weapons greatly increased.
0x153c98: Civil wars, revolutions, regional disputes...it seems like there is a new war popping up somewhere every day,
0x153d19: and many of them are the result of centuries-old hatred between different ethnic or religious groups.
0x153d8f: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x153dcf: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.
0x153e54: A nuclear deterrent is meaningless because emotions run so hot.
0x153ea1: Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear missiles, the decision to use tactical nuclear missiles is in some cases left up to battlefield commanders.
0x153f46: It is pretty scary.
0x153f64: As long as nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the chances that someone is going to use them will also continue to grow...
0x154015: Ironically, the policy of nuclear deterrence has prevented  the elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x154085: The entire basis for determining them to be illegal has been undermined by this military policy.
0x1540f6: In other words, nuclear weapons cannot be declared illegal because we have an entrenched policy which makes them legal ipso facto.
0x1541aa: America and Russia are not the only countries with nuclear weapons.
0x1541fb: During the Cold War, the UK, France and China publicly declared the existence of their own nuclear arsenals.
0x15427b: Since we entered the 21st century,
0x1542a8: we have confirmed the existence of nuclear weapons programs in countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia.
0x154340: Nukes are steadily proliferating.  The 21st century is paying for the 20th century's failure to plug the holes in the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)
0x1543e8: and for the IAEA's failure to tighten nuclear control measures.
0x154453: The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was established in 1957 to oversee peaceful as well as military applications of atomic power.
0x1544f2: But the IAEA can only investigate those countries which request an investigation.
0x154554: Furthermore, the timing of the inspection must be approved by  the country in question. They are not allowed to do sneak inspections.
0x1545ed: The country that is being investigated can even dictate the nationality of  the inspectors that they will allow in.
0x154671: In the late 1970's, Iraq would only allow inspectors from Bulgaria and Russia to enter the country.
0x1546e5: The IAEA does not even have the authority to level fines against countries who have committed infractions.
0x154763: After the Gulf War, they discovered that Iraq had been developing nuclear weapons in secret right under the investigators' noses!
0x1547f8: Unfortunately, as an organization,  the IAEA just did not have the teeth to effectively stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
0x1548bb: In 1970, all five nuclear powers, America, the Soviet Union, France, England and China, signed the NPT.
0x154933: The treaty provided that the non-nuclear equipped countries could receive assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear power.
0x1549c7: But military applications of nuclear power were strictly prohibited,
0x154a19: and the IAEA was given the responsibility of investigating countries who were suspected of being in non-compliance with the NPT.
0x154aad: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x154b03: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between...
0x154b93: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x154c34: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x154c91: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x154d29: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,

0x1550ec: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x15512c: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.

0x155dde: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x155e34: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between...
0x155ec4: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x155fa7: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x15606d: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x1560e4: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x156147: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x1561f6: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x156250: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x1562eb: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x15635f: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x1563fc: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x15649c: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x156517: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x156597: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x156652: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x1566c9: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x15672c: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x1567d0: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x15682a: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x1568c5: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x156939: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x1569cb: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x156a6b: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x156ae6: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x156ba8: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x156c05: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x156c9d: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,
0x156d35: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x156dd8: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.
0x156e6f: There is no doubt about it. After the Cold War ended, the chance of a full-scale world-wide nuclear conflagration was diminished.
0x156f04: But on the other hand, the chances of local, tactical use of nuclear weapons greatly increased.
0x156f74: Civil wars, revolutions, regional disputes...it seems like there is a new war popping up somewhere every day,
0x156ff5: and many of them are the result of centuries-old hatred between different ethnic or religious groups.
0x15706b: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x1570ab: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.
0x157130: A nuclear deterrent is meaningless because emotions run so hot.
0x15717d: Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear missiles, the decision to use tactical nuclear missiles is in some cases left up to battlefield commanders.
0x157222: It is pretty scary.
0x157240: As long as nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the chances that someone is going to use them will also continue to grow...
0x1572f1: Ironically, the policy of nuclear deterrence has prevented  the elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x157361: The entire basis for determining them to be illegal has been undermined by this military policy.
0x1573d2: In other words, nuclear weapons cannot be declared illegal because we have an entrenched policy which makes them legal ipso facto.
0x157486: America and Russia are not the only countries with nuclear weapons.
0x1574d7: During the Cold War, the UK, France and China publicly declared the existence of their own nuclear arsenals.
0x157557: Since we entered the 21st century,
0x157584: we have confirmed the existence of nuclear weapons programs in countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia.
0x15761c: Nukes are steadily proliferating.  The 21st century is paying for the 20th century's failure to plug the holes in the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)
0x1576c4: and for the IAEA's failure to tighten nuclear control measures.
0x15772f: The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was established in 1957 to oversee peaceful as well as military applications of atomic power.
0x1577ce: But the IAEA can only investigate those countries which request an investigation.
0x157830: Furthermore, the timing of the inspection must be approved by  the country in question. They are not allowed to do sneak inspections.
0x1578c9: The country that is being investigated can even dictate the nationality of  the inspectors that they will allow in.
0x15794d: In the late 1970's, Iraq would only allow inspectors from Bulgaria and Russia to enter the country.
0x1579c1: The IAEA does not even have the authority to level fines against countries who have committed infractions.
0x157a3f: After the Gulf War, they discovered that Iraq had been developing nuclear weapons in secret right under the investigators' noses!
0x157ad4: Unfortunately, as an organization,  the IAEA just did not have the teeth to effectively stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
0x157b97: In 1970, all five nuclear powers, America, the Soviet Union, France, England and China, signed the NPT.
0x157c0f: The treaty provided that the non-nuclear equipped countries could receive assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear power.
0x157ca3: But military applications of nuclear power were strictly prohibited,
0x157cf5: and the IAEA was given the responsibility of investigating countries who were suspected of being in non-compliance with the NPT.
0x157d89: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x157ddf: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between...
0x157e6f: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x157f10: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x157f6d: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x158005: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,

0x159db7: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x159ee9: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x159f71: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x159fbe: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x15a007: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x15a055: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x15a0bf: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x15a150: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x15a209: You're a tough lady.
0x15a22e: You're a tough lady.
0x15a24f: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x15a29b: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x15a2f9: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x15a381: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x15a415: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x15a4a5: Same here, Snake.
0x15a4bb: 7HNASTASHA
0x15a552: I cannot believe it! Dr. Naomi working with the terrorists...
0x15a59d: I don't want to believe it either.
0x15a5ca: But if what Campbell says is true...
0x15a5f9: I know. Nastasha, have you ever heard of FoxDie?
0x15a637: FoxDie? No, sorry...I've never heard of it.
0x15a670: Oh well....Forget about it.
0x15a6b8: Snake, forget about Dr. Naomi. Right now the most important thing you have to worry about is reinserting that PAL code.
0x15a777: Nastasha, I'm going to ask you one more time. Do you know anything about FoxDie and the real nature of this operation?
0x15a801: Sorry. I have not been told anything about that.
0x15a83f: That's funny. The Colonel said almost exactly the same thing.
0x15a88a: ..........
0x15a89f: Sorry. I didn't mean to sound sarcastic. I believe you...
0x15a944: Snake, you are in danger! Get out of there!
0x15a97d: Yeah but how?
0x15a9b3: Isn't there someone who knows this base...?
0x15a9ec: Dr. Emmerich! Maybe he can do something.
0x15aa34: All you can do is wait for Dr. Emmerich to open the door. Stay alive, Snake.
0x15aab8: Snake, what are you doing? Go after Liquid!
0x15ab54: I am a military analyst and an expert on high-tech weapons, but I do not know anything about Metal Gear.
0x15abcd: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?
0x15ac15: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x15ac75: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x15ace7: I am a military analyst and an expert on high-tech weapons, but I do not know anything about Metal Gear.
0x15ad60: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?
0x15ad9d: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x15adfd: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x15aeb1: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x15af11: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x15af83: Radome stands for radar dome. It is a cover protecting a super-sensitive electronic scanning array.
0x15aff7: Almost all modern combat aircraft have them.
0x15b031: It is not just a radar system in there. That radome probably contains infrared sensors, motion detectors, and other quipment, too.
0x15b0c7: It is like a combination of eyes, ears and nose all rolled into one. If you could destroy that you might have a chance...
0x15b172: Use your Stinger missiles carefully.  If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.
0x15b1f4: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x15b254: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x15b2bb: Radome stands for radar dome. It is a cover protecting a super-sensitive electronic scanning array.
0x15b32f: Almost all modern combat aircraft have them.
0x15b369: It is not just a radar system in there. That radome probably contains infrared sensors, motion detectors, and other quipment, too.
0x15b3ff: It is like a combination of eyes, ears and nose all rolled into one. If you could destroy that you might have a chance...
0x15b49f: Use your Stinger missiles carefully.  If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.
0x15b546: Use your Stinger missiles carefully.  If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.
0x15b5d6: Snake, it is just you and Liquid now. There's no advice I can give you.
0x15b62b: Trust yourself! You have got to win!!
0x15b68a: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x15b719: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x15b78f: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x15b814: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x15b885: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x15b8c2: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x15b928: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x15b967: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x15b9d3: You don't mean...
0x15b9ef: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x15ba83: ..........
0x15ba98: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x15bb15: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x15bb51: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x15bbd5: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x15bc34: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x15bc83: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x15bd22: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x15bd98: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x15be22: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x15bea2: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x15bef9: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x15bf6e: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x15c056: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x15c0f3: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x15c152: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x15c1e9: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x15c259: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x15c29f: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x15c30e: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x15c3c1: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x15c44a: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x15c4a6: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x15c51b: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x15c5e7: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x15c681: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x15c6b0: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x15c709: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x15c7ed: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x15c84c: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x15c900: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x15c98d: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x15c9d7: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x15ca50: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x15ca86: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x15cb0f: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x15cb5d: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x15cc0c: That is a FAMAS.
0x15cc27: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x15ccca: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x15cd91: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x15cdb5: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x15cdf5: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x15ce70: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x15cf02: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x15cf70: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x15d034: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x15d0a4: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x15d0de: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x15d171: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x15d1c9: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x15d277: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x15d2cc: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x15d342: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x15d3d8: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x15d452: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x15d4d4: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x15d501: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x15d586: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x15d5cd: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x15d66a: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x15d6aa: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x15d793: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x15d7d6: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x15d841: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x15d88b: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x15d928: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x15d9a5: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x15da33: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x15dad3: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x15db2d: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x15dbf8: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x15dc3b: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x15dd27: A cardboard box.
0x15dd42: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x15ddd4: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x15de61: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x15ded1: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x15df6d: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x15e006: wood or something.
0x15e023: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x15e08a: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x15e0b7: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x15e126: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x15e14a: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x15e1d2: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x15e22f: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x15e29d: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x15e2ef: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x15e3a4: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x15e3c3: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x15e418: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x15e48f: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x15e4dc: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x15e568: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x15e5e5: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x15e640: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x15e70a: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x15e780: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x15e7fe: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x15e830: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x15e8c4: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x15e968: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x15ea10: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x15ea4a: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x15eb36: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x15eb89: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x15ecaf: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x15ed17: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x15eda2: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x15ee01: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x15ee55: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x15eef9: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x15ef57: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x15efcc: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x15f037: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x15f0a5: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x15f12b: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x15f1c4: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x15f222: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x15f28c: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x15f2f7: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x15f365: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x15f3e0: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x15f448: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x15f4d3: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x15f532: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x15f5c8: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x15f625: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x15f6bd: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,
0x15f755: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x15f7f8: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.
0x15f88f: There is no doubt about it. After the Cold War ended, the chance of a full-scale world-wide nuclear conflagration was diminished.
0x15f924: But on the other hand, the chances of local, tactical use of nuclear weapons greatly increased.
0x15f994: Civil wars, revolutions, regional disputes...it seems like there is a new war popping up somewhere every day,
0x15fa15: and many of them are the result of centuries-old hatred between different ethnic or religious groups.
0x15fa8b: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x15facb: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.
0x15fb50: A nuclear deterrent is meaningless because emotions run so hot.
0x15fb9d: Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear missiles, the decision to use tactical nuclear missiles is in some cases left up to battlefield commanders.
0x15fc42: It is pretty scary.
0x15fc60: As long as nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the chances that someone is going to use them will also continue to grow...
0x15fd11: Ironically, the policy of nuclear deterrence has prevented  the elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x15fd81: The entire basis for determining them to be illegal has been undermined by this military policy.
0x15fdf2: In other words, nuclear weapons cannot be declared illegal because we have an entrenched policy which makes them legal ipso facto.
0x15fea6: America and Russia are not the only countries with nuclear weapons.
0x15fef7: During the Cold War, the UK, France and China publicly declared the existence of their own nuclear arsenals.
0x15ff77: Since we entered the 21st century,
0x15ffa4: we have confirmed the existence of nuclear weapons programs in countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia.
0x16003c: Nukes are steadily proliferating.  The 21st century is paying for the 20th century's failure to plug the holes in the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)
0x1600e4: and for the IAEA's failure to tighten nuclear control measures.
0x16014f: The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was established in 1957 to oversee peaceful as well as military applications of atomic power.
0x1601ee: But the IAEA can only investigate those countries which request an investigation.
0x160250: Furthermore, the timing of the inspection must be approved by  the country in question. They are not allowed to do sneak inspections.
0x1602e9: The country that is being investigated can even dictate the nationality of  the inspectors that they will allow in.
0x16036d: In the late 1970's, Iraq would only allow inspectors from Bulgaria and Russia to enter the country.
0x1603e1: The IAEA does not even have the authority to level fines against countries who have committed infractions.
0x16045f: After the Gulf War, they discovered that Iraq had been developing nuclear weapons in secret right under the investigators' noses!
0x1604f4: Unfortunately, as an organization,  the IAEA just did not have the teeth to effectively stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
0x1605b7: In 1970, all five nuclear powers, America, the Soviet Union, France, England and China, signed the NPT.
0x16062f: The treaty provided that the non-nuclear equipped countries could receive assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear power.
0x1606c3: But military applications of nuclear power were strictly prohibited,
0x160715: and the IAEA was given the responsibility of investigating countries who were suspected of being in non-compliance with the NPT.
0x1607a9: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x1607ff: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between...
0x16088f: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x160930: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x16098d: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x160a25: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,

0x161bc0: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x161ca3: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x161d69: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x161de0: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x161e43: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x161ef2: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x161f4c: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x161fe7: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x16205b: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x1620f8: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x162198: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x162213: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x162293: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!

0x1661a0: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x166214: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x1662a6: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x166346: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x1663c1: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x1664f1: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x166579: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1665c6: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x16660f: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x16665d: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x1666c7: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x166758: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x166811: You're a tough lady.
0x166836: You're a tough lady.
0x166857: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x1668a3: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x166901: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x166989: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x166a1d: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x166aad: Same here, Snake.
0x166ac3: 7HNASTASHA
0x166b5a: I cannot believe it! Dr. Naomi working with the terrorists...
0x166ba5: I don't want to believe it either.
0x166bd2: But if what Campbell says is true...
0x166c01: I know. Nastasha, have you ever heard of FoxDie?
0x166c3f: FoxDie? No, sorry...I've never heard of it.
0x166c78: Oh well....Forget about it.
0x166cc0: Snake, forget about Dr. Naomi. Right now the most important thing you have to worry about is reinserting that PAL code.
0x166d7f: Nastasha, I'm going to ask you one more time. Do you know anything about FoxDie and the real nature of this operation?
0x166e09: Sorry. I have not been told anything about that.
0x166e47: That's funny. The Colonel said almost exactly the same thing.
0x166e92: ..........
0x166ea7: Sorry. I didn't mean to sound sarcastic. I believe you...
0x166f4c: Snake, you are in danger! Get out of there!
0x166f85: Yeah but how?
0x166fbb: Isn't there someone who knows this base...?
0x166ff4: Dr. Emmerich! Maybe he can do something.
0x16703c: All you can do is wait for Dr. Emmerich to open the door. Stay alive, Snake.
0x1670c0: Snake, what are you doing? Go after Liquid!
0x16715c: I am a military analyst and an expert on high-tech weapons, but I do not know anything about Metal Gear.
0x1671d5: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?
0x16721d: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x16727d: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x1672ef: I am a military analyst and an expert on high-tech weapons, but I do not know anything about Metal Gear.
0x167368: Why don't you ask Dr. Emmerich?
0x1673a5: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x167405: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x1674b9: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x167519: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x16758b: Radome stands for radar dome. It is a cover protecting a super-sensitive electronic scanning array.
0x1675ff: Almost all modern combat aircraft have them.
0x167639: It is not just a radar system in there. That radome probably contains infrared sensors, motion detectors, and other quipment, too.
0x1676cf: It is like a combination of eyes, ears and nose all rolled into one. If you could destroy that you might have a chance...
0x16777a: Use your Stinger missiles carefully.  If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.
0x1677fc: It probably uses some kind of electronic targeting equipment similar to a tank.
0x16785c: If you use chaff, you should be able to confuse it for a little while.
0x1678c3: Radome stands for radar dome. It is a cover protecting a super-sensitive electronic scanning array.
0x167937: Almost all modern combat aircraft have them.
0x167971: It is not just a radar system in there. That radome probably contains infrared sensors, motion detectors, and other quipment, too.
0x167a07: It is like a combination of eyes, ears and nose all rolled into one. If you could destroy that you might have a chance...
0x167aa7: Use your Stinger missiles carefully.  If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.
0x167b4e: Use your Stinger missiles carefully.  If you run out, you'll have no chance to win.
0x167be3: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x167c72: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x167ce8: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x167d6d: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x167dde: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x167e1b: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x167e81: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x167ec0: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x167f2c: You don't mean...
0x167f48: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x167fdc: ..........
0x167ff1: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x16806e: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x1680aa: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x16812e: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x16818d: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x1681dc: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x16827b: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x1682f1: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x16837b: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x1683fb: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x168452: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x1684c7: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x1685af: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x16864c: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x1686ab: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x168742: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x1687b2: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x1687f8: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x168867: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x16891a: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x1689a3: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x1689ff: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x168a74: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x168b40: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x168bda: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x168c09: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x168c62: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x168d46: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x168da5: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x168e59: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x168ee6: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x168f30: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x168fa9: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x168fdf: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x169068: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x1690b6: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x169165: That is a FAMAS.
0x169180: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x169223: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x1692ea: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x16930e: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x16934e: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x1693c9: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x16945b: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x1694c9: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x16958d: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x1695fd: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x169637: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x1696ca: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x169722: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x1697d0: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x169825: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x16989b: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x169931: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x1699ab: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x169a2d: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x169a5a: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x169adf: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x169b26: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x169bc3: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x169c03: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x169cec: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x169d2f: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x169d9a: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x169de4: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x169e81: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x169efe: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x169f8c: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x16a02c: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x16a086: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x16a151: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x16a194: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x16a280: A cardboard box.
0x16a29b: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x16a32d: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x16a3ba: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x16a42a: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x16a4c6: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x16a55f: wood or something.
0x16a57c: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x16a5e3: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x16a610: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x16a67f: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x16a6a3: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x16a72b: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x16a788: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x16a7f6: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x16a848: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x16a8fd: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x16a91c: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x16a971: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x16a9e8: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x16aa35: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x16aac1: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x16ab3e: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x16ab99: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x16ac63: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x16acd9: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x16ad57: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x16ad89: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x16ae1d: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x16aec1: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x16af69: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x16afa3: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x16b08f: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x16b0e2: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x16b208: That stuff that is flowing in those ditches on the 1st floor must be radioactive nuclear waste water.
0x16b27e: You had better stay away from it. You are already exposed enough just by being in that area. Any further exposure could be fatal.
0x16b313: That place does not have a nuclear processing facility.
0x16b358: It must be some other kind of nuclear material that is leaking besides the dismantled nuclear warheads...
0x16b3d2: ...probably spent nuclear fuel or something.
0x16b42a: Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear reactor, it will always produce, as a waste product,
0x16b493: some spent-fuel mixed with highly toxic, radioactive compounds.
0x16b4e0: Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive for 300 years. In other words, this material will remain lethal for the next three centuries.
0x16b594: There was a time when we thought it was safe to seal the nuclear waste in special containers...
0x16b604: and bury it in a layer of rock salt without much exposure to underground water.
0x16b664: Even though we now know there are big problems with that, we still do not have an effective disposal solution.
0x16b6e3: Most of the nuclear waste we produce is just shoved underground with no intention of ever processing it.
0x16b75c: It is like an ostrich with its head in the sand. No?
0x16b7bc: There is a process which involves mixing the nuclear waste with low grade uranium to convert it into a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...
0x16b850: ...for burning in light water reactors, usually in the form of glass logs.
0x16b8a8: But MOX contaminates a nuclear reactor more quickly than low grade uranium. It is also highly toxic.
0x16b91d: It is economically unfeasible unless the price of uranium is more than four times what it currently is.
0x16b995: Not only that, you cannot ignore the danger inherent in transporting the MOX from the processing factories to the nuclear reactors.
0x16ba2c: An accident could lead to radioactive contamination or the materials could be hijacked by terrorists...
0x16baa4: No, I do not think MOX could be called a viable solution to the problem of plutonium disposal.
0x16bb31: There is only one effective use for nuclear waste.
0x16bb71: Military applications. You see, after chemical reprocessing, they can separate plutonium from the nuclear waste.
0x16bbf5: Nuclear weapons normally use military grade plutonium 239 with a purity of 93-94%.
0x16bc58: It is made in special nuclear reactors designed for military applications.
0x16bcb0: On the other hand, the plutonium in spent nuclear fuel only has a purity of about 60%.
0x16bd17: But that does not mean that spent nuclear fuel cannot be used for military applications.
0x16bd80: America has been successful in tests using weapons made from nuclear reactor grade plutonium.
0x16bdee: That means that eventually everyone will be able to make nuclear weapons from plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel.
0x16be9a: Spent nuclear fuel can also be used to make depleted uranium (DU) bullets or shells. They are armor- piercing anti-tank rounds.
0x16bf2d: DU is two-and-a-half times denser than steel and 50% denser than lead, so it makes it an extremely effective armor-piercing weapon.
0x16bfc4: It can cut through tank armor like a hot knife through butter.
0x16c010: Unfortunately, when a DU round explodes, it spreads a fine dust which, when absorbed into a body,
0x16c082: supposedly causes terrible long-term health problems including genetic damage.
0x16c0e1: During the Gulf War, American as well as Iraqi soldiers were exposed to DU dust and suffered from radiation poisoning and other illnesses.
0x16c17f: The American government conducted research to discover whether exposure could lead to cancer or genetic damage,
0x16c202: ...but the results were inconclusive.
0x16c232: Some people think that this type of radioactive contamination is what is behind the "Gulf War Syndrome",
0x16c2ad: but the government will not admit it...
0x16c2fd: They are currently doing research to find ways to transform minor actinoids such as Americium and Neptunium,
0x16c37a: which are highly toxic with long half lives, into nuclear materials with short half lives.
0x16c3e5: It's called extinction processing, but it is not being used much due to all the technical and economic problems with it.
0x16c471: A serious program for nuclear waste treatment has yet to be established.
0x16c4e5: Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear reactor, it will always produce, as a waste product,
0x16c54e: some spent-fuel mixed with highly toxic, radioactive compounds.
0x16c59b: Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive for 300 years. In other words, this material will remain lethal for the next three centuries.
0x16c644: There was a time when we thought it was safe to seal the nuclear waste in special containers...
0x16c6b4: and bury it in a layer of rock salt without much exposure to underground water.
0x16c714: Even though we now know there are big problems with that, we still do not have an effective disposal solution.
0x16c793: Most of the nuclear waste we produce is just shoved underground with no intention of ever processing it.
0x16c80c: It is like an ostrich with its head in the sand. No?
0x16c861: There is a process which involves mixing the nuclear waste with low grade uranium to convert it into a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...
0x16c8f5: ...for burning in light water reactors, usually in the form of glass logs.
0x16c94d: But MOX contaminates a nuclear reactor more quickly than low grade uranium. It is also highly toxic.
0x16c9c2: It is economically unfeasible unless the price of uranium is more than four times what it currently is.
0x16ca3a: Not only that, you cannot ignore the danger inherent in transporting the MOX from the processing factories to the nuclear reactors.
0x16cad1: An accident could lead to radioactive contamination or the materials could be hijacked by terrorists...
0x16cb49: No, I do not think MOX could be called a viable solution to the problem of plutonium disposal.
0x16cbcb: There is only one effective use for nuclear waste.
0x16cc0b: Military applications. You see, after chemical reprocessing, they can separate plutonium from the nuclear waste.
0x16cc8f: Nuclear weapons normally use military grade plutonium 239 with a purity of 93-94%.
0x16ccf2: It is made in special nuclear reactors designed for military applications.
0x16cd4a: On the other hand, the plutonium in spent nuclear fuel only has a purity of about 60%.
0x16cdb1: But that does not mean that spent nuclear fuel cannot be used for military applications.
0x16ce1a: America has been successful in tests using weapons made from nuclear reactor grade plutonium.
0x16ce88: That means that eventually everyone will be able to make nuclear weapons from plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel.
0x16cf29: Spent nuclear fuel can also be used to make depleted uranium (DU) bullets or shells. They are armor- piercing anti-tank rounds.
0x16cfbc: DU is two-and-a-half times denser than steel and 50% denser than lead, so it makes it an extremely effective armor-piercing weapon.
0x16d053: It can cut through tank armor like a hot knife through butter.
0x16d09f: Unfortunately, when a DU round explodes, it spreads a fine dust which, when absorbed into a body,
0x16d111: supposedly causes terrible long-term health problems including genetic damage.
0x16d170: During the Gulf War, American as well as Iraqi soldiers were exposed to DU dust and suffered from radiation poisoning and other illnesses.
0x16d20e: The American government conducted research to discover whether exposure could lead to cancer or genetic damage,
0x16d291: ...but the results were inconclusive.
0x16d2c1: Some people think that this type of radioactive contamination is what is behind the "Gulf War Syndrome",
0x16d33c: but the government will not admit it...
0x16d381: They are currently doing research to find ways to transform minor actinoids such as Americium and Neptunium,
0x16d3fe: which are highly toxic with long half lives, into nuclear materials with short half lives.
0x16d469: It's called extinction processing, but it is not being used much due to all the technical and economic problems with it.
0x16d4f5: A serious program for nuclear waste treatment has yet to be established.
0x16d5b2: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x16d61a: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x16d6a5: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x16d704: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x16d758: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x16d7fc: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x16d85a: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x16d8cf: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x16d93a: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x16d9a8: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x16da2e: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x16dac7: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x16db25: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x16db8f: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x16dbfa: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x16dc68: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x16dce3: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x16dd4b: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x16ddd6: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x16de35: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x16decb: That stuff that is flowing in those ditches on the 1st floor must be radioactive nuclear waste water.
0x16df41: You had better stay away from it. You are already exposed enough just by being in that area. Any further exposure could be fatal.
0x16dfd6: That place does not have a nuclear processing facility.
0x16e01b: It must be some other kind of nuclear material that is leaking besides the dismantled nuclear warheads...
0x16e095: ...probably spent nuclear fuel or something.
0x16e0ed: Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear reactor, it will always produce, as a waste product,
0x16e156: some spent-fuel mixed with highly toxic, radioactive compounds.
0x16e1a3: Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive for 300 years. In other words, this material will remain lethal for the next three centuries.
0x16e257: There was a time when we thought it was safe to seal the nuclear waste in special containers...
0x16e2c7: and bury it in a layer of rock salt without much exposure to underground water.
0x16e327: Even though we now know there are big problems with that, we still do not have an effective disposal solution.
0x16e3a6: Most of the nuclear waste we produce is just shoved underground with no intention of ever processing it.
0x16e41f: It is like an ostrich with its head in the sand. No?
0x16e47f: There is a process which involves mixing the nuclear waste with low grade uranium to convert it into a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...
0x16e513: ...for burning in light water reactors, usually in the form of glass logs.
0x16e56b: But MOX contaminates a nuclear reactor more quickly than low grade uranium. It is also highly toxic.
0x16e5e0: It is economically unfeasible unless the price of uranium is more than four times what it currently is.
0x16e658: Not only that, you cannot ignore the danger inherent in transporting the MOX from the processing factories to the nuclear reactors.
0x16e6ef: An accident could lead to radioactive contamination or the materials could be hijacked by terrorists...
0x16e767: No, I do not think MOX could be called a viable solution to the problem of plutonium disposal.
0x16e7f4: There is only one effective use for nuclear waste.
0x16e834: Military applications. You see, after chemical reprocessing, they can separate plutonium from the nuclear waste.
0x16e8b8: Nuclear weapons normally use military grade plutonium 239 with a purity of 93-94%.
0x16e91b: It is made in special nuclear reactors designed for military applications.
0x16e973: On the other hand, the plutonium in spent nuclear fuel only has a purity of about 60%.
0x16e9da: But that does not mean that spent nuclear fuel cannot be used for military applications.
0x16ea43: America has been successful in tests using weapons made from nuclear reactor grade plutonium.
0x16eab1: That means that eventually everyone will be able to make nuclear weapons from plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel.
0x16eb5d: Spent nuclear fuel can also be used to make depleted uranium (DU) bullets or shells. They are armor- piercing anti-tank rounds.
0x16ebf0: DU is two-and-a-half times denser than steel and 50% denser than lead, so it makes it an extremely effective armor-piercing weapon.
0x16ec87: It can cut through tank armor like a hot knife through butter.
0x16ecd3: Unfortunately, when a DU round explodes, it spreads a fine dust which, when absorbed into a body,
0x16ed45: supposedly causes terrible long-term health problems including genetic damage.
0x16eda4: During the Gulf War, American as well as Iraqi soldiers were exposed to DU dust and suffered from radiation poisoning and other illnesses.
0x16ee42: The American government conducted research to discover whether exposure could lead to cancer or genetic damage,
0x16eec5: ...but the results were inconclusive.
0x16eef5: Some people think that this type of radioactive contamination is what is behind the "Gulf War Syndrome",
0x16ef70: but the government will not admit it...
0x16efc0: They are currently doing research to find ways to transform minor actinoids such as Americium and Neptunium,
0x16f03d: which are highly toxic with long half lives, into nuclear materials with short half lives.
0x16f0a8: It's called extinction processing, but it is not being used much due to all the technical and economic problems with it.
0x16f134: A serious program for nuclear waste treatment has yet to be established.
0x16f1a8: Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear reactor, it will always produce, as a waste product,
0x16f211: some spent-fuel mixed with highly toxic, radioactive compounds.
0x16f25e: Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive for 300 years. In other words, this material will remain lethal for the next three centuries.
0x16f307: There was a time when we thought it was safe to seal the nuclear waste in special containers...
0x16f377: and bury it in a layer of rock salt without much exposure to underground water.
0x16f3d7: Even though we now know there are big problems with that, we still do not have an effective disposal solution.
0x16f456: Most of the nuclear waste we produce is just shoved underground with no intention of ever processing it.
0x16f4cf: It is like an ostrich with its head in the sand. No?
0x16f524: There is a process which involves mixing the nuclear waste with low grade uranium to convert it into a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...
0x16f5b8: ...for burning in light water reactors, usually in the form of glass logs.
0x16f610: But MOX contaminates a nuclear reactor more quickly than low grade uranium. It is also highly toxic.
0x16f685: It is economically unfeasible unless the price of uranium is more than four times what it currently is.
0x16f6fd: Not only that, you cannot ignore the danger inherent in transporting the MOX from the processing factories to the nuclear reactors.
0x16f794: An accident could lead to radioactive contamination or the materials could be hijacked by terrorists...
0x16f80c: No, I do not think MOX could be called a viable solution to the problem of plutonium disposal.
0x16f88e: There is only one effective use for nuclear waste.
0x16f8ce: Military applications. You see, after chemical reprocessing, they can separate plutonium from the nuclear waste.

0x16fbec: Spent nuclear fuel can also be used to make depleted uranium (DU) bullets or shells. They are armor- piercing anti-tank rounds.
0x16fc7f: DU is two-and-a-half times denser than steel and 50% denser than lead, so it makes it an extremely effective armor-piercing weapon.
0x16fd16: It can cut through tank armor like a hot knife through butter.
0x16fd62: Unfortunately, when a DU round explodes, it spreads a fine dust which, when absorbed into a body,

0x16ff54: ...but the results were inconclusive.
0x16ff84: Some people think that this type of radioactive contamination is what is behind the "Gulf War Syndrome",
0x16ffff: but the government will not admit it...
0x170044: They are currently doing research to find ways to transform minor actinoids such as Americium and Neptunium,
0x1700c1: which are highly toxic with long half lives, into nuclear materials with short half lives.
0x17012c: It's called extinction processing, but it is not being used much due to all the technical and economic problems with it.
0x1701b8: A serious program for nuclear waste treatment has yet to be established.
0x170263: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x1702cb: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x170356: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x1703b5: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x170409: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x1704ad: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x17050b: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x170580: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x1705eb: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x170659: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x1706df: Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. That is why the world must never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
0x170778: Nuclear weapons are destructive enough to kill every living thing on Earth...
0x1707d6: and to render the planet uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years.
0x170840: In the history of mankind, there has never been a weapon created which was not later used.
0x1708ab: If we do not do something, we are just going to blow ourselves up. There's no doubt about it.
0x170919: As long as nuclear weapons exist, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.
0x170994: There is a big difference between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction.
0x1709fc: Conventional weapons are intended for use against military targets, but nuclear weapons are used against noncombatants.
0x170a87: Nukes are designed to kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a flash.
0x170ae6: That is why nuclear weapons are so evil.
0x170bff: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x170c87: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x170cd4: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x170d1d: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x170d6b: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x170dd5: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x170e66: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x170f1f: You're a tough lady.
0x170f44: You're a tough lady.
0x170f65: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x170fb1: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x17100f: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x171097: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x17112b: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1711bb: Same here, Snake.
0x1711d1: 7HNASTASHA
0x17123f: Security cameras? Da.
0x17125f: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff,  you will be able to disable it.
0x171380: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x171408: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x171455: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x17149e: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x1714ec: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x171556: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x1715e7: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x1716a0: You're a tough lady.
0x1716c5: You're a tough lady.
0x1716e6: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x171732: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x171790: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x171818: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1718ac: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x17193c: Same here, Snake.
0x171952: 7HNASTASHA
0x1719dd: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x171a6c: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x171ae2: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x171b67: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x171bd8: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x171c15: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x171c7b: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x171cba: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x171d26: You don't mean...
0x171d42: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x171dd6: ..........
0x171deb: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x171e68: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x171ea4: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x171f28: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x171f87: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x171fd6: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x172075: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x1720eb: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x172175: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x1721f5: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x17224c: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x1722c1: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x1723a9: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x172446: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x1724a5: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x17253c: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x1725ac: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x1725f2: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x172661: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x172714: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x17279d: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x1727f9: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x17286e: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x17293a: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x1729d4: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x172a03: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x172a5c: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x172b40: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x172b9f: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x172c53: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x172ce0: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x172d2a: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x172da3: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x172dd9: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x172e62: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x172eb0: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x172f5f: That is a FAMAS.
0x172f7a: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x17301d: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x1730e4: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x173108: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x173148: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x1731c3: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x173255: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x1732c3: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x173387: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x1733f7: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x173431: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x1734c4: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x17351c: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x1735ca: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x17361f: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x173695: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x17372b: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x1737a5: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x173827: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x173854: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x1738d9: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x173920: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x1739bd: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x1739fd: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x173ae6: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x173b29: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x173b94: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x173bde: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x173c7b: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x173cf8: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x173d86: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x173e26: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x173e80: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x173f4b: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x173f8e: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x17407a: A cardboard box.
0x174095: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x174127: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x1741b4: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x174224: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x1742c0: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x174359: wood or something.
0x174376: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x1743dd: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x17440a: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x174479: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x17449d: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x174525: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x174582: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x1745f0: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x174642: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x1746f7: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x174716: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x17476b: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x1747e2: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x17482f: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x1748bb: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x174938: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x174993: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x174a5d: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x174ad3: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x174b51: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x174b83: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x174c17: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x174cbb: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x174d63: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x174d9d: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x174e89: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x174edc: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x174fef: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x175068: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x1750b1: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x17511c: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x1751a1: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x175206: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x17526c: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x1752ea: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x175370: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x1753bc: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x175411: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x17545b: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x1754d5: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x17555e: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x175604: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x17566d: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x1756b6: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x175754: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x1757db: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x175854: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1758d4: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x175990: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x175a09: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x175a52: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x175abd: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x175b42: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x175ba7: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x175c0d: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x175c8b: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x175d11: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x175d5d: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x175d91: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x175ddb: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x175e55: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x175ede: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x175f63: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x175fcc: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x176015: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x176092: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x176119: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x176192: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x176212: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x17634e: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1763d6: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x176423: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x17646c: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x1764ba: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x176524: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x1765b5: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x17666e: You're a tough lady.
0x176693: You're a tough lady.
0x1766b4: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x176700: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x17675e: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x1767e6: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x17687a: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x17690a: Same here, Snake.
0x176920: 7HNASTASHA
0x17698e: Security cameras? Da.
0x1769ae: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff,  you will be able to disable it.
0x176acf: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x176b57: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?

0x17708b: Same here, Snake.
0x1770a1: 7HNASTASHA
0x17712c: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x1771bb: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x177231: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x1772b6: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x177327: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x177364: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x1773ca: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x177409: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x177475: You don't mean...
0x177491: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x177525: ..........
0x17753a: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x1775b7: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x1775f3: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x177677: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x1776d6: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x177725: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x1777c4: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x17783a: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x1778c4: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x177944: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x17799b: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x177a10: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x177af8: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x177b95: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x177bf4: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x177c8b: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x177cfb: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x177d41: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x177db0: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x177e63: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x177eec: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x177f48: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x177fbd: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x178089: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x178123: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x178152: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x1781ab: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x17828f: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x1782ee: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x1783a2: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x17842f: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x178479: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x1784f2: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x178528: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x1785b1: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x1785ff: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x1786ae: That is a FAMAS.
0x1786c9: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x17876c: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x178833: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x178857: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x178897: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x178912: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x1789a4: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x178a12: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x178ad6: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x178b46: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x178b80: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x178c13: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x178c6b: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x178d19: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x178d6e: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x178de4: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x178e7a: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x178ef4: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x178f76: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x178fa3: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x179028: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x17906f: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x17910c: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x17914c: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x179235: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x179278: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x1792e3: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x17932d: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x1793ca: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x179447: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x1794d5: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x179575: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x1795cf: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x17969a: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x1796dd: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x1797c9: A cardboard box.
0x1797e4: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x179876: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x179903: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x179973: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x179a0f: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x179aa8: wood or something.
0x179ac5: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x179b2c: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x179b59: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x179bc8: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x179bec: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x179c74: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x179cd1: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x179d3f: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x179d91: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x179e46: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x179e65: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x179eba: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x179f31: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x179f7e: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x17a00a: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x17a087: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x17a0e2: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x17a1ac: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x17a222: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x17a2a0: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x17a2d2: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x17a366: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x17a40a: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x17a4b2: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x17a4ec: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x17a5d8: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x17a62b: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x17a73e: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x17a7b7: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x17a800: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x17a86b: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x17a8f0: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x17a955: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x17a9bb: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x17aa39: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x17aabf: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x17ab0b: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x17ab60: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x17abaa: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.

0x17acad: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x17ad53: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x17adbc: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.

0x17cb58: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x17cbc4: You don't mean...
0x17cbe0: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x17cc74: ..........
0x17cc89: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x17cd06: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x17cd42: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x17cdc6: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x17ce25: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x17ce74: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x17cf13: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x17cf89: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x17d013: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x17d093: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x17d0ea: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x17d15f: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x17d247: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x17d2e4: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x17d343: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x17d3da: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x17d44a: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x17d490: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x17d4ff: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x17d5b2: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x17d63b: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x17d697: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x17d70c: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x17d7d8: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x17d872: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x17d8a1: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x17d8fa: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x17d9de: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x17da3d: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x17daf1: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x17db7e: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x17dbc8: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x17dc41: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x17dc77: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x17dd00: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x17dd4e: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x17ddfd: That is a FAMAS.
0x17de18: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x17debb: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x17df82: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x17dfa6: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x17dfe6: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x17e061: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x17e0f3: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x17e161: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x17e225: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x17e295: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x17e2cf: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x17e362: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x17e3ba: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x17e468: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x17e4bd: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x17e533: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x17e5c9: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x17e643: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x17e6c5: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x17e6f2: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x17e777: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x17e7be: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x17e85b: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x17e89b: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x17e984: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x17e9c7: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x17ea32: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x17ea7c: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x17eb19: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x17eb96: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x17ec24: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x17ecc4: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x17ed1e: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x17ede9: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x17ee2c: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x17ef18: A cardboard box.
0x17ef33: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x17efc5: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x17f052: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x17f0c2: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x17f15e: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x17f1f7: wood or something.
0x17f214: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x17f27b: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x17f2a8: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x17f317: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x17f33b: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x17f3c3: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x17f420: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x17f48e: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x17f4e0: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x17f595: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x17f5b4: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x17f609: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x17f680: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x17f6cd: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x17f759: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x17f7d6: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x17f831: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x17f8fb: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x17f971: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x17f9ef: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x17fa21: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x17fab5: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x17fb59: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x17fc01: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x17fc3b: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x17fd27: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x17fd7a: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x17fe8d: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x17ff06: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x17ff4f: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x17ffba: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x18003f: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x1800a4: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x18010a: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x180188: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x18020e: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x18025a: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x1802af: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x1802f9: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x180373: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x1803fc: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x1804a2: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x18050b: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x180554: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x1805f2: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x180679: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x1806f2: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x180772: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x18082e: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x1808a7: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x1808f0: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x18095b: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x1809e0: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x180a45: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x180aab: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x180b29: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x180baf: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x180bfb: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x180c2f: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...

0x180f30: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x180fb7: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x181030: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1810b0: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x1811ec: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x181274: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1812c1: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x18130a: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x181358: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x1813c2: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x181453: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x18150c: You're a tough lady.
0x181531: You're a tough lady.
0x181552: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x18159e: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x1815fc: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x181684: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x181718: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1817a8: Same here, Snake.
0x1817be: 7HNASTASHA
0x18182c: Security cameras? Da.
0x18184c: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff,  you will be able to disable it.
0x18196d: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1819f5: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x181a42: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x181a8b: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.

0x181e99: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x181f29: Same here, Snake.
0x181f3f: 7HNASTASHA
0x181fca: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x182059: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x1820cf: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x182154: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x1821c5: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x182202: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x182268: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x1822a7: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.

0x184268: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x1842e5: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x184373: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x184413: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x18446d: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x184538: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x18457b: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x184667: A cardboard box.
0x184682: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x184714: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x1847a1: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x184811: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x1848ad: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x184946: wood or something.
0x184963: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x1849ca: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x1849f7: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x184a66: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x184a8a: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x184b12: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x184b6f: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x184bdd: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x184c2f: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x184ce4: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x184d03: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x184d58: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x184dcf: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x184e1c: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x184ea8: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x184f25: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x184f80: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x18504a: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x1850c0: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x18513e: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x185170: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x185204: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x1852a8: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x185350: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x18538a: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x185476: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x1854c9: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x1855dc: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x185655: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x18569e: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x185709: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x18578e: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x1857f3: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x185859: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x1858d7: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x18595d: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x1859a9: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x1859fe: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x185a48: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x185ac2: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x185b4b: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x185bf1: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x185c5a: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x185ca3: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x185d41: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x185dc8: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x185e41: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x185ec1: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x185f7d: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x185ff6: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x18603f: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x1860aa: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x18612f: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x186194: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x1861fa: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x186278: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x1862fe: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x18634a: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x18637e: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x1863c8: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x186442: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x1864cb: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.

0x18677f: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1867ff: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x18693b: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1869c3: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x186a10: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x186a59: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x186aa7: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x186b11: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x186ba2: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x186c5b: You're a tough lady.
0x186c80: You're a tough lady.
0x186ca1: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x186ced: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x186d4b: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x186dd3: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x186e67: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x186ef7: Same here, Snake.
0x186f0d: 7HNASTASHA
0x186f7b: Security cameras? Da.
0x186f9b: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff,  you will be able to disable it.
0x1870bc: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x187144: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x187191: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1871da: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x187228: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x187292: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x187323: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x1873dc: You're a tough lady.
0x187401: You're a tough lady.
0x187422: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x18746e: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x1874cc: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x187554: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1875e8: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x187678: Same here, Snake.
0x18768e: 7HNASTASHA
0x187719: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x1877a8: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x18781e: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x1878a3: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x187914: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x187951: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x1879b7: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x1879f6: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x187a62: You don't mean...
0x187a7e: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x187b12: ..........
0x187b27: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x187ba4: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x187be0: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x187c64: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x187cc3: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x187d12: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x187db1: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x187e27: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x187eb1: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x187f31: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x187f88: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x187ffd: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x1880e5: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x188182: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x1881e1: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x188278: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x1882e8: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x18832e: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x18839d: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x188450: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x1884d9: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x188535: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x1885aa: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x188676: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x188710: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x18873f: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x188798: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x18887c: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x1888db: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x18898f: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x188a1c: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x188a66: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x188adf: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x188b15: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x188b9e: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x188bec: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x188c9b: That is a FAMAS.
0x188cb6: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x188d59: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x188e20: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x188e44: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x188e84: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x188eff: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x188f91: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x188fff: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x1890c3: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x189133: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x18916d: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x189200: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x189258: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x189306: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x18935b: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x1893d1: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x189467: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x1894e1: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x189563: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x189590: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x189615: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x18965c: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x1896f9: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x189739: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x189822: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x189865: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x1898d0: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x18991a: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x1899b7: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x189a34: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x189ac2: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x189b62: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x189bbc: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x189c87: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x189cca: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x189db6: A cardboard box.
0x189dd1: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x189e63: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x189ef0: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.

0x18a095: wood or something.
0x18a0b2: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x18a119: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x18a146: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x18a1b5: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x18a1d9: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.

0x18a433: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x18a452: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x18a4a7: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x18a51e: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x18a56b: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x18a5f7: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.

0x18b9c7: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x18ba4d: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x18ba99: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x18bacd: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x18bb17: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x18bb91: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x18bc1a: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x18bc9f: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x18bd08: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x18bd51: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x18bdce: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x18be55: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x18bece: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x18bf4e: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x18c08a: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x18c112: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x18c15f: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x18c1a8: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x18c1f6: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x18c260: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x18c2f1: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x18c3aa: You're a tough lady.
0x18c3cf: You're a tough lady.
0x18c3f0: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x18c43c: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x18c49a: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x18c522: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x18c5b6: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x18c646: Same here, Snake.
0x18c65c: 7HNASTASHA
0x18c6ca: Security cameras? Da.
0x18c6ea: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff,  you will be able to disable it.
0x18c80b: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x18c893: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x18c8e0: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?

0x18cdc7: Same here, Snake.
0x18cddd: 7HNASTASHA
0x18ce68: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x18cef7: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x18cf6d: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x18cff2: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x18d063: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x18d0a0: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x18d106: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x18d145: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x18d1b1: You don't mean...
0x18d1cd: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x18d261: ..........
0x18d276: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x18d2f3: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x18d32f: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x18d3b3: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x18d412: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x18d461: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x18d500: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x18d576: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x18d600: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x18d680: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x18d6d7: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x18d74c: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x18d834: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x18d8d1: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x18d930: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x18d9c7: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x18da37: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x18da7d: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x18daec: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x18db9f: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x18dc28: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x18dc84: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x18dcf9: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x18ddc5: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x18de5f: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x18de8e: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x18dee7: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x18dfcb: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x18e02a: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x18e0de: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x18e16b: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x18e1b5: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x18e22e: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x18e264: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x18e2ed: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x18e33b: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x18e3ea: That is a FAMAS.
0x18e405: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x18e4a8: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x18e56f: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x18e593: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x18e5d3: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x18e64e: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x18e6e0: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x18e74e: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x18e812: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x18e882: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x18e8bc: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x18e94f: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x18e9a7: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x18ea55: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x18eaaa: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x18eb20: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x18ebb6: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x18ec30: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x18ecb2: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x18ecdf: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x18ed64: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x18edab: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x18ee48: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x18ee88: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x18ef71: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x18efb4: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x18f01f: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x18f069: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x18f106: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x18f183: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x18f211: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x18f2b1: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x18f30b: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x18f3d6: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x18f419: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x18f505: A cardboard box.
0x18f520: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x18f5b2: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x18f63f: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x18f6af: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x18f74b: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x18f7e4: wood or something.
0x18f801: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x18f868: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x18f895: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x18f904: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x18f928: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x18f9b0: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x18fa0d: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x18fa7b: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x18facd: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x18fb82: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x18fba1: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x18fbf6: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x18fc6d: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x18fcba: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x18fd46: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x18fdc3: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x18fe1e: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x18fee8: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x18ff5e: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x18ffdc: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x19000e: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x1900a2: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x190146: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x1901ee: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x190228: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x190314: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x190367: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x19047a: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x1904f3: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x19053c: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x1905a7: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x19062c: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x190691: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x1906f7: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x190775: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,

0x19307f: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x193116: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x193186: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x1931cc: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x19323b: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x1932ee: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x193377: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x1933d3: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x193448: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x193514: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x1935ae: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x1935dd: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x193636: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x19371a: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x193779: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x19382d: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x1938ba: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x193904: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x19397d: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x1939b3: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x193a3c: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x193a8a: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x193b39: That is a FAMAS.
0x193b54: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x193bf7: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x193cbe: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x193ce2: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x193d22: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x193d9d: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x193e2f: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x193e9d: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x193f61: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x193fd1: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x19400b: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x19409e: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x1940f6: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x1941a4: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x1941f9: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x19426f: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x194305: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x19437f: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x194401: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x19442e: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x1944b3: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x1944fa: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x194597: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x1945d7: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x1946c0: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x194703: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x19476e: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x1947b8: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x194855: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x1948d2: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x194960: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x194a00: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x194a5a: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x194b25: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x194b68: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x194c54: A cardboard box.
0x194c6f: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x194d01: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x194d8e: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x194dfe: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x194e9a: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x194f33: wood or something.
0x194f50: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x194fb7: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x194fe4: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x195053: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x195077: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x1950ff: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x19515c: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x1951ca: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x19521c: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x1952d1: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x1952f0: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x195345: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x1953bc: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x195409: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x195495: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x195512: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x19556d: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x195637: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x1956ad: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x19572b: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x19575d: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x1957f1: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x195895: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x19593d: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x195977: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x195a63: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x195ab6: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x195bc9: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x195c42: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x195c8b: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x195cf6: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x195d7b: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x195de0: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x195e46: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x195ec4: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x195f4a: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x195f96: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x195feb: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x196035: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x1960af: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x196138: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x1961de: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x196247: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x196290: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x19632e: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x1963b5: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x19642e: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1964ae: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x19656a: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x1965e3: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x19662c: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x196697: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x19671c: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x196781: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x1967e7: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x196865: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x1968eb: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x196937: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x19696b: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...

0x196dec: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x196f28: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x196fb0: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x196ffd: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x197046: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x197094: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x1970fe: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x19718f: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x197248: You're a tough lady.
0x19726d: You're a tough lady.
0x19728e: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x1972da: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x197338: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x1973c0: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x197454: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1974e4: Same here, Snake.
0x1974fa: 7HNASTASHA
0x197568: Security cameras? Da.
0x197588: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff,  you will be able to disable it.
0x1976a9: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x197731: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19777e: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1977c7: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x197815: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x19787f: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x197910: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x1979c9: You're a tough lady.
0x1979ee: You're a tough lady.
0x197a0f: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x197a5b: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x197ab9: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x197b41: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x197bd5: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x197c65: Same here, Snake.
0x197c7b: 7HNASTASHA
0x197d06: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x197d95: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x197e0b: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x197e90: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x197f01: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x197f3e: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x197fa4: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x197fe3: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x19804f: You don't mean...
0x19806b: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x1980ff: ..........
0x198114: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x198191: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x1981cd: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x198251: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x1982b0: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x1982ff: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x19839e: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x198414: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x19849e: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x19851e: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x198575: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x1985ea: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x1986d2: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x19876f: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x1987ce: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.

0x198ac6: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x198b22: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x198b97: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x198c63: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.

0x19a7c6: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x19a84e: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x19a8ab: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x19a919: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x19a96b: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x19aa20: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x19aa3f: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x19aa94: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x19ab0b: Those are Night-Vision Goggles. They do not use special lenses.
0x19ab58: They electronically amplify the light by transforming it into electric signals which they then boost to create an image.
0x19abe4: They amplify the light 100,000 times. You will be able to see 500 meters by starlight just as if it was day.
0x19ac61: But it won't work in complete darkness since there is no light to amplify.
0x19acbc: Those Night-Vision Goggles will make your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use them for too long a period of time.
0x19ad86: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x19adfc: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x19ae7a: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x19aeac: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x19af40: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x19afe4: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x19b08c: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x19b0c6: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x19b1b2: You found Body Armor. It will lower the damage you take from gunfire.
0x19b205: It is designed to prevent bullets from penetrating, but you will still feel the impact from the bullets. Don't rely on it too much.
0x19b318: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x19b391: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x19b3da: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x19b445: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x19b4ca: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x19b52f: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x19b595: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x19b613: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x19b699: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x19b6e5: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x19b73a: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x19b784: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x19b7fe: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x19b887: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x19b92d: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x19b996: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x19b9df: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x19ba7d: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x19bb04: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x19bb7d: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x19bbfd: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x19bcb9: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x19bd32: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x19bd7b: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x19bde6: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x19be6b: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x19bed0: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x19bf36: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x19bfb4: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x19c03a: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x19c086: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x19c0ba: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x19c104: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x19c17e: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x19c207: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x19c28c: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x19c2f5: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x19c33e: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x19c3bb: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x19c442: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x19c4bb: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x19c53b: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x19c664: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x19c6ec: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19c739: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19c782: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x19c7d0: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x19c83a: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x19c8cb: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x19c984: You're a tough lady.
0x19c9a9: You're a tough lady.
0x19c9ca: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x19ca16: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x19ca74: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x19cafc: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19cb90: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19cc20: Same here, Snake.
0x19cc36: 7HNASTASHA
0x19cca4: Security cameras? Da.
0x19ccc4: That is the wireless type which transmits visual data to a central security area. If you use chaff,  you will be able to disable it.
0x19cdeb: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x19ce73: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19cec0: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19cf09: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x19cf57: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x19cfc1: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x19d052: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x19d10b: You're a tough lady.
0x19d130: You're a tough lady.
0x19d151: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x19d19d: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x19d1fb: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x19d283: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19d317: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19d3a7: Same here, Snake.
0x19d3bd: 7HNASTASHA
0x19d3fa: Snake, that room is set with infrared sensors. You should be able to see them if you had some smoke... cigarette smoke or something.
0x19d4b1: Sorry, but these are smokeless cigarettes.
0x19d4e9: You mean those cigarettes that are designed to cut down on second- hand smoke?
0x19d548: Oh well. Don't worry... If you blow the smoke in the direction of the infrared sensors, you should be able to see them.
0x19d5d3: That was a good idea bringing the cigarettes. But don't smoke too much. Cigarettes make you weak, in mind and body. They are bad for you.
0x19d711: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x19d799: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19d7e6: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19d82f: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.

0x19d978: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x19da31: You're a tough lady.
0x19da56: You're a tough lady.
0x19da77: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x19dac3: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x19db21: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x19dba9: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19dc3d: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19dccd: Same here, Snake.
0x19dce3: 7HNASTASHA
0x19dd20: Snake, there are Gun Cameras somewhere around there. They'll open fire automatically if they detect you. Be careful.
0x19dda8: You should be able to confuse their sensors briefly with your chaff. Get past them while they are disabled!
0x19de43: You could also destroy them with your Stinger missiles.
0x19df19: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x19dfa1: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19dfee: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19e037: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x19e085: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.

0x19e445: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19e4d5: Same here, Snake.
0x19e4eb: 7HNASTASHA
0x19e53b: He's using a Single Action Army? The first model of that gun was made in 1873...over 130 years ago.
0x19e5af: Today they're still being made in small numbers, but that's just for collectors and such. Nobody uses them in combat anymore...
0x19e660: The biggest drawback to revolver style handguns is the reload time. That's your chance.
0x19e757: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x19e7df: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x19e82c: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?

0x19ec83: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x19ed13: Same here, Snake.
0x19ed29: 7HNASTASHA
0x19ed72: As long as the strategy of nuclear deterrence continues, nuclear weapons may be reduced, but they will never be eliminated.
0x19ee01: If you think about it, nuclear reduction does not mean much without elimination as the ultimate goal.
0x19ee77: I used to work in the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). I figured the only way to achieve nuclear elimination...
0x19eefc: ...was to work from the inside to convince them of the ineffectiveness of the deterrence theory.
0x19ef6d: Seems like you're pretty focused on that issue.
0x19efaa: ...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad thing to see...and I have seen a lot of it.
0x19f010: ...I have seen more than enough of it...
0x19f04f: I was born and raised in Prypiat, Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that day...April 26, 1986.
0x19f0bb: You don't mean...
0x19f0d7: Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that changed my life and thousands of other lives. I lived just three kilometers north of there.
0x19f16b: ..........
0x19f180: 600,000-700,000 people were evacuated. Over 650,000 children suffered the effects of radiation poisoning.
0x19f1fd: Between 1986 and 1993, 12,000 children died...
0x19f239: My parents, and many others like them who helped in the cleanup, died a few years later from radiation sickness.
0x19f2bd: We must rid this world of all nuclear weapons...before they cause more misery.
0x19f31c: Before they destroy the delicate environment that keeps us alive.
0x19f36b: I will not allow this pain and anxiety to pass on to yet another generation.
0x19f3d8: Snake, radiation sickness is a horrible thing...
0x19f416: I watched my friends, family...all my loved ones die slowly from it.
0x19f468: It ate away at them like a living thing...they died wretched deaths. All I could do was watch.
0x19f4d7: I sat in my bed and cried for days, whimpering in fear.
0x19f51c: I thought it was my turn next...
0x19f547: ..........
0x19f55c: I was cursed...cursed by the sudden explosion at Chernobyl. Why did this terrible thing have to happen to us?! I cursed at God for what he did to us...
0x19f607: I went to America after my parents died, but the terrible curse followed me.
0x19f664: It was not until many years later that I decided to put all of my efforts into making this world free from nuclear weapons...
0x19f6f5: After I learned that I was unable to have children.
0x19f736: Nastasha...I'm sorry.
0x19f756: Since I was exposed at age 10, I suffered from problems with my thyroid gland.
0x19f7b5: ...It wasn't really a surprise, but when the reality of it hits you...it is quite a shock.
0x19f820: You became infertile from radiation poisoning?
0x19f85c: To be told that you cannot have a child...that you will never be able to pass on your genes to a new generation...
0x19f8e2: ...you cannot know what it is like.
0x19f910: ..........
0x19f925: It took a long time, and I hurt a lot of people along the way, but learning I was infertile allowed me to think clearly.
0x19f9b1: I decided that instead of having children, I would help to make the world a safe and better place for future generations.
0x19fa3e: I determined to work for the elimination of nuclear weapons, and so I joined the Pentagon.
0x19faa9: Nastasha....
0x19fac0: I'm sorry to go on and on about myself.
0x19faf2: Please forget I said anything.
0x19fb3f: The area is filled with gas. Probably an organophosphate nerve agent like Soman or something similar.
0x19fbb5: Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you some protection. Also, your nanomachines contain anti-BC neutralizing agents, so...
0x19fc3f: ...you should be okay for a short time. But what you really need is  a Gas Mask.
0x19fcbf: An organophosphate nerve agent is a gas which invades an animal's nerves.
0x19fd16: It was first used as a weapon in World War II, and the casualties resulting from it were tremendous.
0x19fd8b: In its pure form, it is a colorless, odorless gas. That gas was probably colored yellow to make it easier to detect in the case of a leak.
0x19fe59: It sounds like you have a bad cold. You had better try to shake it off.
0x19fed6: Harasho...good! You found a SOCOM. That's a Special Operations Command Pistol.
0x19ff35: It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of stopping power. It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
0x19ffcc: If you hold down the Weapon Button, you can train the laser sight on the enemy to help you aim.
0x1a003c: If you find a SOCOM suppressor, you can equip that, too.
0x1a0082: That pistol was designed specifically for use by special forces, so I think it will be useful.
0x1a00f1: Some people find it a little heavy and hard to use, but it shouldn't be a problem for you.
0x1a0194: Those are Stun Grenades. They are often used in sensitive operations such as freeing hostages and that sort of thing.
0x1a021d: Sometimes they are called "flash bangs" or  "sound and flash grenades."
0x1a0279: They make a big flash and lots of noise which will disorient and disable your opponents temporarily.
0x1a02ee: You have to understand that they won't kill the bad guys, but just stun them for a few seconds. Use them wisely.
0x1a03aa: That's a Chaff Grenade. It's a special grenade that disperses thin, narrow metallic strips of various lengths and frequency responses.
0x1a0444: It can confuse electronic equipment.
0x1a0473: It will be useful against machines which depend upon electronic sensors.
0x1a04cc: Naturally, for it to be effective, you must use it before you are attacked. If you are expecting an attack, spread the chaff beforehand.
0x1a05a0: You found some Grenades. Just pull the pin and it explodes after five seconds.
0x1a05ff: You can get a lot done during those five seconds, Snake. How you use them is up to you. 
0x1a06a3: That is C4 explosive. A plastic explosive with a texture similar to clay, so you can shape it in almost any way you want.
0x1a0730: Although it has 1.4 times the destructive power of dynamite,
0x1a077a: it is highly stable and won't explode without a detonating device, even if it is shot, burned or beaten.
0x1a07f3: You are using a wireless detonator, yes?
0x1a0829: The detonator is equipped with a scrambler so you don't have to worry about interference from any other radio source.
0x1a08b2: Make sure you are sufficiently far enough away when it goes off.
0x1a0900: Also, as you know, the sound of the explosive will alert your enemies,  so be careful.
0x1a099f: That is a FAMAS.
0x1a09ba: It is a bullpup style assault rifle.  It is durable and easy to use. Very resistant to overheating, it is a reliable weapon with smooth action.
0x1a0a5d: It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute. On full auto, you will empty a  25 round magazine in a few seconds.
0x1a0b14: Those are Claymore Mines.
0x1a0b38: Unlike other mines, which are planted underground,
0x1a0b78: claymores are set up above ground and are designed to produce maximum damage in a wide-fan shaped area.
0x1a0bf3: When they go off, they spray seven hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets in a 60 degree pattern much like an oversized shotgun.
0x1a0c85: Traditionally, claymores use a trip wire to set them off, but those claymores are a new type.
0x1a0cf3: They are camouflaged using the new stealth technology and are equipped with sophisticated motion detectors.
0x1a0da7: Those are remote-controlled miniature reconaissance missiles, sometimes called Nikita Missiles.
0x1a0e17: They've got CCD cameras in their nose cones.
0x1a0e51: After you fire them, they'll transmit their visual data to your monitor. You can control their flight freely in all directions.
0x1a0ee4: But the missiles have a limited amount of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.
0x1a0f3c: Press the First Person View Button to see the missile's visual data. Use them wisely.
0x1a0fda: Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of the best sniper rifles in the world.
0x1a102f: It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly through a 2.5 centimeter square from a distance of 100 meters.
0x1a10a5: Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic. Its best feature is that it allows for rapid fire.
0x1a113b: When you are shooting over long distances, the slightest tremble can make you miss your target by inches.
0x1a11b5: Try to keep your hands as still as possible.
0x1a1227: You found Stinger missiles. Great!
0x1a1254: They are equipped with a thermal homing device, so once they locked on they will automatically pursue the target.
0x1a12d9: To lock on, all you have to do is line up the crosshairs.
0x1a1320: Stingers are very potent, short-range, low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of Soviet aircraft with them.
0x1a13bd: In fact, they were forced to change their tactics.
0x1a13fd: One of my favorite horror books is called Stinger and my favorite cocktail is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've got a thing for Stingers.
0x1a14d6: Good. You found a Suppressor for the SOCOM pistol.
0x1a1519: If you equip that, you won't have to worry about being noticed by the enemy when you fire.
0x1a1584: It will greatly reduce the sound and flash from your muzzle.
0x1a15ce: It uses a multi-layered chamber to lower the velocity of the gas emissions and thus reduce the sound and flash when you fire your weapon.
0x1a166b: The Suppressor is narrow enough so that you can still use the gun's original sight even when it is equipped.
0x1a16e8: It shouldn't change the feel when you fire it.
0x1a1766: That is a Mine Detector. It works by searching for metal objects. It will even find Claymores that are hidden with optic stealth technology.
0x1a1806: It is set so that the position of the land mines will show up on your radar.
0x1a1860: All you have to do is equip the mine detector and keep an eye on your radar. Use it carefully.
0x1a191b: Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, hazardous waste...
0x1a195e: We're constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?
0x1a1a3a: A cardboard box.
0x1a1a55: A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. They are usually made of recycled paper.
0x1a1ae7: It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. It was originally used to absorb one's sweat when wearing hats.
0x1a1b74: With the same amount of wood to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes.
0x1a1be4: And since it's recyclable, it's highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That's why it's widely used for packing.
0x1a1c80: But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... 
0x1a1d19: wood or something.
0x1a1d36: Also, the crevices should be filled with Styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.
0x1a1d9d: ...So anyway, what's with the box?
0x1a1dca: ...Oh nothing...no big deal.
0x1a1e29: You got a Gas Mask. Good.
0x1a1e4d: That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision.
0x1a1ed5: It is equipped with a voice emitter, so do not worry about not being  heard.
0x1a1f32: The outside is made of reinforced  plastic and the inside is made from  an acetate weave. 
0x1a1fa0: Also the eye pieces are specially  treated so they won't fog up. 
0x1a1ff2: You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that mask. Use it wisely.
0x1a2097: A tranquilizer? Yes.
0x1a20b6: I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to prevent her hands from quivering.
0x1a210b: Maybe you should try the same thing.
0x1a2172: Thermal Goggles work by thermal imaging instead of by amplifying light like the Night-Vision Goggles.
0x1a21e8: They'll work just as well in complete darkness. Not only that, they can also penetrate optic stealth systems.
0x1a2266: You will be able to spot Claymores too.
0x1a2298: But they will tire your eyes out, so do not use them too much.
0x1a231c: Cold medicine? I don't know. It looks like regular old cold medicine to me.
0x1a23b0: Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters thick, lightweight and hard to cut you should be able to rappel with it as well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
0x1a2458: No. It looks like it's made of nylon fibers.
0x1a2492: Good. When hemp rope gets wet it loses its flexibility. It would not be good for rappelling. But that rope sounds like it will not be a problem.
0x1a256b: Snake, that is a nuclear warhead storage area.
0x1a25a7: Are all these filled with nuclear warheads?
0x1a25e0: Yes. But their detonation mechanisms have been removed.
0x1a2625: So I don't have to worry about this island turning into a pile of smoking rubble?
0x1a2687: No. But if the casing is damaged,  they may be leaking nuclear materials. Please make sure you do not use your gun around there.
0x1a2739: Naturally, nuclear weapons contain plutonium.
0x1a2774: Most of the radiation emitted by plutonium isotopes consists of alpha rays.
0x1a27d0: The ionization effects are strong, but if they are kept in containers there is no danger of exposure.
0x1a2846: But if plutonium enters the body through breathing or other contact,  it is quickly absorbed into the bones and internal organs.
0x1a28da: After that, there is no way to remove it. 
0x1a2912: Once that happens, the victim will be constantly exposed to it, and just one one-millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer.
0x1a29a9: That is why a plutonium leak is such a serious danger. Make sure you do not use your gun anywhere near there.
0x1a2a45: Scientists are currently using gene therapy to try to create a microorganism capable of breaking down plutonium, but...
0x1a2ad0: ...they have not yet had any success.
0x1a2b03: The plutonium version of bio-remediation, huh.
0x1a2b3f: Instead of processing, what about reusing it? I thought that they were working on using dismantled plutonium for civilian applications.
0x1a2bda: For a time, it looked like there was going to be international cooperation for that,
0x1a2c3f: ...but unfortunately there was too much mutual suspicion, and it all fell apart.
0x1a2cbb: The signing of START was a step in the right direction, but it created a flood of dismantled plutonium.
0x1a2d33: Disposing of that plutonium safely is now the biggest challenge facing the world.
0x1a2d95: Combustion in nuclear reactors, vitrification processing...lots of suggestions have been made, but in reality...
0x1a2e19: ...no effective solutions have been found.
0x1a2e6f: Naturally, nuclear weapons contain plutonium.
0x1a2eaa: Most of the radiation emitted by plutonium isotopes consists of alpha rays.
0x1a2f06: The ionization effects are strong, but if they are kept in containers there is no danger of exposure.
0x1a2f7c: But if plutonium enters the body through breathing or other contact,  it is quickly absorbed into the bones and internal organs.
0x1a3010: After that, there is no way to remove it. 
0x1a3048: Once that happens, the victim will be constantly exposed to it, and just one one-millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause cancer.
0x1a30df: That is why a plutonium leak is such a serious danger. Make sure you do not use your gun anywhere near there.
0x1a3170: Scientists are currently using gene therapy to try to create a microorganism capable of breaking down plutonium, but...

0x1a3539: ...no effective solutions have been found.
0x1a362f: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.
0x1a36b7: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1a3704: You're the nuclear specialist that the Colonel mentioned?
0x1a374d: That's me. You can ask me anything about nukes that you want.
0x1a379b: I am also a military analyst, so I have an extensive knowledge of weapon systems as well.
0x1a3805: They asked me to participate in this operation as a supervisor from the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. I was happy to accept.
0x1a3896: We must not allow terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons of any kind. I hope I can help you to stop them.
0x1a394f: You're a tough lady.
0x1a3974: You're a tough lady.
0x1a3995: Those terrorists are serious about launching a nuclear weapon?
0x1a39e1: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x1a3a3f: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x1a3ac7: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1a3b5b: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1a3beb: Same here, Snake.
0x1a3c01: 7HNASTASHA
0x1a3c5f: That area is mined?
0x1a3c9e: If you only had a Mine Detector...
0x1a3cd9: After you locate the mines on your radar, crawl forward and retrieve them.
0x1a3d50: Anti-personnel mines have killed over 20,000 non-combatants in the past thirty years.
0x1a3db6: In countries like Cambodia and Nicaragua, the killing and maiming of innocent victims continues long after the wars have ended.
0x1a3e49: It is easy to plant the mines, you see, but removing them is a different matter.
0x1a3eaa: It requires more time and manpower than anyone is willing to invest.
0x1a3efc: The superpowers need to donate more mine detectors and other equipment to remove them. It is the least we could do after laying them.
0x1a3fcc: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x1a4045: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x1a408e: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?
0x1a40f9: They cannot do that. You see, when you dismantle a warhead, you still have nuclear materials that must be stored.
0x1a417e: At this point, all of the nuclear material storage facilities are way past capacity.
0x1a41e3: But they could not stop dismantling weapons while at the same time pushing START-2...
0x1a4249: So you're telling me that this base was built so they could temporarily avoid being in conflict with START-2?
0x1a42c7: Most people think that we live in a safer world now. But with all the dismantled nuclear weapons and waste around,
0x1a434d: ...the threat of nuclear terrorism has increased tremendously.
0x1a4399: It's ironic, isn't it?
0x1a43ee: After the START-2 accord was signed on January 3, 1993...
0x1a4438: Russia and the U.S. reduced their strategic nuclear warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each.
0x1a44b2: They completely dismantled all of the ICBMs which contained MIRVs (multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles).
0x1a453b: As a result of that, there are over 15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads waiting to be disposed of.
0x1a45e1: The warheads are supposed to be dismantled at Pantex or some other dismantling facility,
0x1a464a: but there are limits to how many warheads they can process.
0x1a4693: We just do not have the capabilities to dismantle all the warheads that are out there.
0x1a4731: Over 200 tons of plutonium and over 1,000 tons of high grade uranium have been removed from nuclear weapons so far.
0x1a47b8: And on top of that, nuclear reactors all over the world continue to produce and leak spent nuclear fuel.
0x1a4831: According to one estimate, as of the year 2005, America alone was storing over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
0x1a48b1: There is no room left in our nuclear material storage sites. That is why we need nuclear weapon disposal facilities.
0x1a496d: The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was built at the beginning of this century.
0x1a49e6: It was made only to temporarily store the nuclear warheads.
0x1a4a2f: Why? If they wanted to dispose of them, why wouldn't they just dismantle  them right away?

0x1a58e6: 7HNASTASHA
0x1a5954: Snake, that is a woman's bathroom. You should not be in there!
0x1a59bf: But I saw Meryl go in here.
0x1a59e5: Even so, Snake!
0x1a59ff: This is our only chance to talk alone together. I was sure she was in here...
0x1a5afb: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.

0x1a60cd: 7HNASTASHA
0x1a6120: Meryl is definitely not herself. Could she be dragged?
0x1a6195: A psychic soldier...yes. Although they won't admit it, many countries have paranormal programs and use psychics in their special-ops.
0x1a622e: Psychics range in power from those who can bend spoons to those who can cause natural disasters.
0x1a62bd: But Psycho Mantis is one of the most powerful. Be careful.
0x1a6394: This is Nastasha Romanenko. A pleasure to work with you, Solid Snake.

0x1a6950: Same here, Snake.

0x1a69c8: Snake, do you like the atmosphere there or something? Hurry up and escape!
0x1a6a35: Just because you are locked up does not mean there is no chance of escape.
0x1a6a90: Keep your eyes and ears open and when you see a chance, take it.
0x1a6afd: You should call Campbell and wait for his instructions.

0x1a6b60: Snake, do you like the atmosphere there or something? Hurry up and escape!

0x1a732a: That was a close one. I didn't think they would go so far as to booby trap your equipment. ...sneaky bastards.
0x1a73e6: Snake, it is just you and Liquid now. There's no advice I can give you.
0x1a743b: Trust yourself! You have got to win!!
0x1a74a4: What about your equipment? You're not going to leave behind everything you've collected are you? Hurry! Grab your stuff.
0x1a7542: Snake, hurry to the Communications Tower.

0x1a89c1: Same here, Snake.

0x1a8a45: Snake, I am detecting high levels of radiation coming from that waterfall. If you get too close you could be exposed.
0x1a8ace: Besides the dismantled warheads, Shadow Moses Island must also be storing some other kind of nuclear materials.
0x1a8b51: Whatever it is, it must be leaking...
0x1a8b81: You have probably heard it before, but I will tell you again. Most nuclear storage facilities aren't in much better shape than this one.
0x1a8c1d: They're causing immeasurable damage to the environment.

0x1a988c: The world cannot stand by idly and allow that to happen. And neither can I...
0x1a98ea: Unfortunately, all I can do from here is provide you with information...
0x1a9972: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1a9a06: Hopefully that'll be enough. Another soldier here wouldn't make a difference anyway. It's good to work with you, Nastasha.
0x1a9a96: Same here, Snake.

0x1a9af5: Snake, you cannot win without a sniper rifle...you cannot save the girl either.
0x1a9b52: Find a sniper rifle. It is the only way to save Meryl.
0x1a9bc8: Sniper Wolf....It is pretty unusual for a sniper to announce their presence before they shoot. She must have a real thing for you.
0x1a9c5e: Anyway, I do not think it is going to be as easy as before.
0x1a9cfb: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x1a9d58: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.
0x1a9df0: There was some talk about both sides reducing their nuclear stockpiles to a "core deterrent force" of less than 500 missiles each,
0x1a9e88: and declaring that there would be no nuclear counterstrike in the event of the use of conventional or chemical weapons. But talks fell through.
0x1a9f2b: It seems that America is unwilling to relinquish its position as the most powerful country in the world.
0x1a9fc2: There is no doubt about it. After the Cold War ended, the chance of a full-scale world-wide nuclear conflagration was diminished.
0x1aa057: But on the other hand, the chances of local, tactical use of nuclear weapons greatly increased.
0x1aa0c7: Civil wars, revolutions, regional disputes...it seems like there is a new war popping up somewhere every day,
0x1aa148: and many of them are the result of centuries-old hatred between different ethnic or religious groups.
0x1aa1be: These people do not think rationally or logically.
0x1aa1fe: In such conflicts, there is no concern for the high civilian casualty rate and international criticism means little.
0x1aa283: A nuclear deterrent is meaningless because emotions run so hot.
0x1aa2d0: Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear missiles, the decision to use tactical nuclear missiles is in some cases left up to battlefield commanders.
0x1aa375: It is pretty scary.
0x1aa393: As long as nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the chances that someone is going to use them will also continue to grow...
0x1aa444: Ironically, the policy of nuclear deterrence has prevented  the elimination of nuclear weapons.
0x1aa4b4: The entire basis for determining them to be illegal has been undermined by this military policy.
0x1aa525: In other words, nuclear weapons cannot be declared illegal because we have an entrenched policy which makes them legal ipso facto.
0x1aa5d9: America and Russia are not the only countries with nuclear weapons.
0x1aa62a: During the Cold War, the UK, France and China publicly declared the existence of their own nuclear arsenals.
0x1aa6aa: Since we entered the 21st century,
0x1aa6d7: we have confirmed the existence of nuclear weapons programs in countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia.
0x1aa76f: Nukes are steadily proliferating.  The 21st century is paying for the 20th century's failure to plug the holes in the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)
0x1aa817: and for the IAEA's failure to tighten nuclear control measures.
0x1aa882: The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) was established in 1957 to oversee peaceful as well as military applications of atomic power.
0x1aa921: But the IAEA can only investigate those countries which request an investigation.
0x1aa983: Furthermore, the timing of the inspection must be approved by  the country in question. They are not allowed to do sneak inspections.
0x1aaa1c: The country that is being investigated can even dictate the nationality of  the inspectors that they will allow in.
0x1aaaa0: In the late 1970's, Iraq would only allow inspectors from Bulgaria and Russia to enter the country.
0x1aab14: The IAEA does not even have the authority to level fines against countries who have committed infractions.
0x1aab92: After the Gulf War, they discovered that Iraq had been developing nuclear weapons in secret right under the investigators' noses!
0x1aac27: Unfortunately, as an organization,  the IAEA just did not have the teeth to effectively stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
0x1aacea: In 1970, all five nuclear powers, America, the Soviet Union, France, England and China, signed the NPT.
0x1aad62: The treaty provided that the non-nuclear equipped countries could receive assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear power.
0x1aadf6: But military applications of nuclear power were strictly prohibited,
0x1aae48: and the IAEA was given the responsibility of investigating countries who were suspected of being in non-compliance with the NPT.
0x1aaedc: But the IAEA could not stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons either.
0x1aaf32: Not only could not the IAEA levy any penalties against violating nations, but it became impossible to distinguish between...
0x1aafc2: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x1ab063: If we do not drastically reduce the number of stockpiled nuclear weapons,...
0x1ab0c0: it is going to become easier and easier for terrorists to get their hands on them...that means more terrorist attacks like this one.

0x1ac2f3: ...technologies which would lead to military development and technologies which were for civilian applications.
0x1ac3d6: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!
0x1ac49c: In the 20th century, in order to be a military superpower, you had to first be an economic superpower.
0x1ac513: But things changed toward the end of the century, after the collapse of Communism.
0x1ac576: With all the surplus weapons and technology floating around, even economically weak countries could have a powerful military.
0x1ac625: According to the military doctrine which is the basis for NATO expansion,
0x1ac67f: ...a preemptive nuclear strike may be undertaken if there is a sufficient threat of a regional conflict spreading to a large-scale war.
0x1ac71a: In the face of all this NATO expansion, Russia might feel the need to flex their nuclear muscles...
0x1ac78e: ...if only to show NATO that, even with their aging arsenal and diminished army, they are still a major power.
0x1ac82b: Russia could no longer pay enough money to its leading scientists, so they sold their weapons and weapons technology to the highest bidders.
0x1ac8cb: NBC weapons flowed into the hands of dictators and terrorists. The military balance of the world crumbled.
0x1ac946: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x1ac9c6: It is so ironic. People are working as slaves to pay for weapons that must never be used...weapons that target the people themselves. It is madness!

0x1b01e6: The world has never seen the balance of power shift so quickly and  dramatically.
0x1b02cb: Get on your stomach. Fire from the prone position. It would be good if you had a tri pod or something stable to balance your weapon on.
0x1b0366: If you don't have that, hold the weapon firmly under your armpit and keep it still with your chin. Line up your target in your scope's crosshairs.
0x1b042a: Most soldiers can hit a target at 300 meters. I have a friend who can hit one at 520 meters.
0x1b04b5: To be a good sniper, you must have nerves of steel and lots of patience. Sometimes you have to sit in position for days, barely moving a muscle.
0x1b0559: The most important thing is to wait for your opportunity and then take it.
0x1b05cf: A slight tremor in your hand can cause you to miss a target 60 meters away by a half foot or more.
0x1b0642: Concentrate, hold your breath and  try to stop your hand from moving.
0x1b06b3: The most important thing is to zero your rifle scope.
0x1b06f6: If you do not zero your sight correctly, you will never be able to hit your target.
0x1b075a: Your sight might be slightly off, so it would be a good idea to try a test shot. If it is off, you will have to take some lead for that when you shoot.
0x1b0805: Don't worry. This was Sniper Wolf's rifle.
0x1b083d: Da. In that case, you had better not  mess with it.
0x1b089c: At a distance of 400 meters, a one degree difference in air temperature will take you about 1 centimeter off your target.
0x1b0929: Atmospheric pressure will affect your shot in the same way. That is why you have to aim differently depending on the conditions.
0x1b09db: Have you ever heard of the Magnus Effect? Normally, a rifle bullet rotates and curves slightly to the right. That is called the Magnus Effect.
0x1b0a7d: Think about comrade Magnus when you are lining up your crosshairs.
0x1b0aeb: Get on your stomach. Fire from the prone position. It would be good if you had a tri pod or something stable to balance your weapon on.
0x1b0b86: If you don't have that, hold the weapon firmly under your armpit and keep it still with your chin. Line up your target in your scope's crosshairs.

0x1b0f4e: Your sight might be slightly off, so it would be a good idea to try a test shot. If it is off, you will have to take some lead for that when you shoot.
0x1b0ff9: Don't worry. This was Sniper Wolf's rifle.
0x1b1031: Da. In that case, you had better not  mess with it.
0x1b10a4: Stay out of his way. You have got to hide and attack. Try a Remote Controlled Missile or your C4 explosives.
0x1b1146: Snake, be careful!
0x1b1163: There are Claymore mines around there.
0x1b1197: Use a Mine Detector!
0x1b11e5: Who are you?
0x1b11fc: Just call me "Deepthroat".
0x1b1223: Deepthroat?
0x1b1239: The informant from the Watergate scandal?
0x1b1270: Never mind about that.
0x1b1291: You're not using burst transmission.
0x1b12c0: Are you nearby?
0x1b12da: Listen. There's a tank in front of your position waiting to ambush you.
0x1b132f: Who are you anyway?
0x1b134d: One of your fans.
0x1b1366: DEEPTHROAT
0x1b1389: DEEPTHROAT
0x1b13bf: Snake, watch out!
0x1b13db: That place is filled with gas.
0x1b1404: Also, the floor is electrified.
0x1b142e: First destroy the high-voltage switch.
0x1b145f: It's the switchboard on the northwest wall.
0x1b1498: But how? I can't reach it.
0x1b14bd: Use a Remote-Controlled Missile.
0x1b1517: Who are you?
0x1b152e: Just call me "Deepthroat".
0x1b1555: Deepthroat?
0x1b156b: The informant from the Watergate scandal?
0x1b15a2: Never mind about that.
0x1b15c3: You're not using burst transmission.
0x1b15f2: Are you nearby?
0x1b160c: Who are you anyway?
0x1b162a: One of your fans.
0x1b1655: DEEPTHROAT
0x1b168b: Snake, there's a bomb planted in your items!
