                                 Text dumped by
                             TheRewster, a.k.a. Rew
                             Updated March 21, 2016
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Note: This text dump is extracted from the North American version of the game, 
released February 5, 2001 for the Nintendo 64.

What follows is a cleaned-up presentation of all the text in the entire game--
not only dialogue but also menu text, item and monster lists, etc. Text was 
extracted from the ROM using WindHex, but because the text is encrypted, I 
needed to compose a table to convert the text from its identifiers in the ROM 
to ASCII format. At some points, it was necessary to take minor liberties with 
the spacing and formatting of the text's presentation.

I am also indebted to the work of Justin Aquadro, who wrote this very handy
guide: http://hocuspocus.taloncrossing.com/rii/pm1docs.txt
Additionally, a short while after I began work on this text dump, an editor for
Paper Mario was released, called Origami 64 (as of this writing, only
available in ver. 0.1). This software likewise proved instrumental in
improving the accuracy of this document.

There is a "raw" version of this text dump--showing all the extra bits of 
control code in the text--available at Romhacking.net. (Just go to "Documents" 
and search for "paper mario text dump," which should bring it up as one of the 
search results.) However, all such codes have been removed from this version to
give it a cleaner presentation.

This is the order in which the text is found in the game's ROM, and thus the 
order it will be presented in this document:
• File menu text
• Prologue + Epilogue (including NPC dialogue)
• NPC dialogue in Toad Town (including Toad Town Tunnels and the Playroom)
• NPC dialogue in Shooting Star Summit and Star Haven
• NPC dialogue in the Prologue areas: Goomba Village, Goomba Road
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 1 areas: Koopa Village, Koopa Bros. Fortress, 
  Pleasant Path
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 2 areas: Mt. Rugged, Dry Dry Desert, 
  Dry Dry Outpost, Dry Dry Ruins
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 3 areas: Forever Forest, Boo's Mansion, 
  Gusty Gulch, Windy Mill, Tubba Blubba's Castle
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 4 area: Shy Guy's Toy Box
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 5 areas: Yoshi's Village, Jade Jungle, 
  Mt. Lavalava
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 6 areas: Flower Fields, Cloudy Climb
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 7 areas: Shiver City, Shiver Snowfield, 
  Starborn Valley, Shiver Mountain, Crystal Palace
• NPC dialogue in the Chapter 8 areas: Bowser's Castle, Princess Peach's Castle
• Peach's events
• Koopa Koot's favors
• Russ T.'s hints
• Toad Town News + Toad Town Underground News
• Goombario's Tattles
• Miscellaneous and menu text
• Letters
• Merlon's messages
• Merluvlee's messages
• Badge and item descriptions
• Item names
• Shop text
• Partner ability descriptions
• Enemy names
• Badge names
• Partner abilities
• Chuck Quizmo's questions + answers

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Today...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm going to tell the story of
"Star Spirits and Good Wishes."
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Far, far away, beyond the sky,
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
way above the clouds,
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
it's been said that there's
a haven where the Stars live.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In the sanctuary of Star Haven
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
there rests a fabled treasure
called the Star Rod,
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
which has the power to grant
all wishes.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Using this wondrous Star Rod,
the seven revered Star Spirits
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
watched over our peaceful world
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
carefully...very carefully.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And then...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh dear... What the...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who stuck that weird thing
into this story?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha ha ha! Yeah! I did!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So I can, at long last, beat my
archenemy, Mario,
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll take this Star Rod!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do it, Kammy Koopa!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No, you mustn't do that!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah! Now let's try using it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stop it! Cut it out, Bowser!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're changing the story!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bwa ha ha ha ha... We did it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That was a piece o' cake!!
Gwaa ha ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now Star Kids may rise to the
Haven to deliver people's wishes...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...but those wishes will not come
true.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whatever can they do...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mail call!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario!
We got a letter from Princess
Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll read it to you, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, let's see...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm throwing a party at my
castle today!
Mario and Luigi, I would be
honored if you both could attend.


Many guests from distant towns 
are hoping to meet you.


There will be tasty sweets and
all kinds of entertainment!
I hope to see you here soon!
  Sincerely, Peach

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a magnificent castle!
I never get used to this place.
It looks like lots of guests are
already here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Say, Mario, why don't you go see
Princess Peach?
I'll go later. I'm thinking I'll
mingle for now.

If you press {A} in front of the
door up there, you can open it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Where are you going?

The princess is expecting us!
You'd better at least say hello!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! Salutations, Mario! 
Do you know Frost T. here?

He's come all the way from the
Shiver region, which lies far to
the north of here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach is such a 
generous and wonderful lady,
just as I was told. 
It was worth coming to visit.

Mario, please come visit us in
the Shiver region someday!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you're looking well!
Please enjoy the party, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! I've never seen so many
guests from different parts of
the world in one place!

I'll bet you could hear some
stories about places you've
never been to, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey...urp...Mario!
I hope you brought an appetite!
There's so much good food here!

I already ate way too much...
I'm taking a little breather.

Well, that's enough of a rest!
I'm hungry again! Let's eat!
To the buffet table!!! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think Princess Peach has been
looking forward to seeing you
since this morning, Mario.

She's been restless...
hee hee hee... How cute...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Welcome, Mario!
The last party was lovely,
wasn't it?

Oh! By the way,
Princess Peach has been waiting
for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome to Peach's Castle!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach went into her
private chambers just now.

She must be a bit tired.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow...
This castle is absolutely
breathtaking, don't you think?

I wish I could stay here at
Peach's Castle forever!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hello there, Mario!
I'm Tayce T.
I really love to cook!♥

You may not know this, but I
cooked all the food for this big
party. I made all of my most
delicious dishes!♥

But... Oh dear...
I got so into my cooking that I
used up all of my ingredients!

Now I have to go shopping!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've been practicing cooking.

I hope that someday I get good
enough to cook food as delicious
as Tayce T.'s.

Do you know how to cook, Mario?
You really ought to learn!
Personally, I think cooking is
exceptionally fun!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Greetings, Mario!
I am the Minister of Princess
Peach's Castle.

It's good to see you here. When
you're around, I feel like our
kingdom is secure.
Yep, our future looks bright!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I come from a desert town called
Dry Dry Outpost. 

This castle is really lovely, isn't
it? Truly gorgeous. So cool and
comfortable...

I even got a chance to talk to
the beautiful Princess Peach.

What an honor! When I return to
Dry Dry Outpost, I'm going to
tell everyone about it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm a Nomadimouse, and I come
from Dry Dry Desert.

Everyone I've met in this town
seems incredibly nice.
I think I'll make this place my
home away from home.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm here on behalf of lovely
Shiver City. I'm the Mayor there,
you know!

My goodness, look at the time!
I have to go shopping for
souvenirs with Frost T.!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I come from Koopa Village, which
is just down the road from here.

Ohhh... I just had the honor of
talking with Princess Peach!
What a wonderful lady she is!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well... Today, we have guests
from Dry Dry Outpost, the
Shiver region, Koopa Village...

There're so many folks here,
I can't keep track of them all.

And where might you be from?
Oh... You're Mario!?
I... I'm sorry! Excuse me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Does Princess Peach have a
special man in her life?

She's such a lovely lady...
Whoever she loves must be very
special indeed...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you know of a place called
Shooting Star Summit?
It's near this castle. It's such
a romantic place...

It's definitely the best place
for a date. Trust me. 
Maybe you ought to, you know,
ask the princess to go there...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, Mario.
I am always on the cutting edge
of fashion, and I must say...

...your outfit is just fabulous. 
It really suits you!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I... I'm just a trainee, sir.

So many guests... My heart's
been beating like a bass drum
ever since this morning...

Thump thump thump thump...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Princess Peach's room,
but I'm afraid she isn't in here 
at the moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
Oh no! Absolutely not!

I don't think it's very polite to
go into her room without asking
her first, Mario! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I said NO, and that means NO.
You are simply not allowed to go
in there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, you're persistent!
I guess I have no choice...

Hurry up in there, though--
and don't touch anything!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I envy you, Mario...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How was it?
To tell you the truth, I've never
seen the inside of her room...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a big fireplace!
And what a cozy fire!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Her dresses are beautiful, but
they all look the same!
This must be her favorite style
of dress.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These are cosmetics.
Mario looks fine without them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A framed photo of Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Quite a fluffy bed.
It looks like this bed was
designed for sweet dreams.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A vase full of lovely flowers.
They smell heavenly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's nice and quiet here with
no guests around.
Ahh...so pleasant.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach went into her
private chambers just now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
You came to the party to see
me! You're so sweet!
Thank you!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was just resting a bit. It
gets tiring, greeting all those
guests out there!

Nobody will bother us here.
Shall we relax and chat, just the
two of us? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It was a lovely day today, so I'm
sure it's comfortable out on the
balcony right now.
Would you accompany me, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Are you all right, Mario?
What in the world was that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh my! Look, Mario!
It's still daytime, isn't it?
... But I can see stars outside!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaa ha ha ha ha ha!
Long time no see, Princess
Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... Bowser!
But this can't be!
It was you who made the ground
shake just now, wasn't it!

Whatever did you do?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwa ha ha ha!

Yeah, that was me! I've lifted
your castle up into the sky!
It's sitting on my castle now!
Weren't expecting that, huh?

Ha! This castle's under my
control now, my dear!
Now you will obey ME!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh!? What?
It's...Mario!! What a shock!

Ha! Not really! I expected you
to turn up, right on cue.
You're just as annoying as ever.

Unfortunately for you, there's
nothing you can do this time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Haven't you learned your lesson
by now, Bowser?

You can never defeat Mario!
Why don't you give up already?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
True, true, I have had my
problems in the past...
But this time is different!

This time I'm gonna win!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, tough guy!
Let's go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you can do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good old Mario...always fighting.
You're a thorn in my side.

But today, your pathetic little
attacks won't beat me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Take a look at this!
Look what I stole from Star
Haven! It's the Star Rod!

This fine piece of work has the
power to grant any wish in the
whole wide world!

And when I use the Star Rod to
increase my strength, even you
can't beat me, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwa ha ha ha ha ha!
How do you like that, Mario?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwa ha ha ha ha ha!
Is that all you've got? How sad!
You'd best take some vitamins,
'cause that didn't hurt at all!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yup, just as I expected. Mario's
no match for the new me.

It's not even worth my time to
toy with you anymore, Mario.
It's time to end this!

Here we go, Mario!
Good night!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no! Mario! Get up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! Oh, yeah! I did it!

I finally did it! I beat my old
rival Mario! Yessss!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Congratulations on your victory,
Your Viciousness!
That's why you're the King!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
As long as I have this Star Rod,
everything I wish will come true!
No one can stop me now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well, well...
I guess I might as well get rid
of Mario. He's no good to anyone
now, that's for sure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! Mario------!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario! Thank you!

You did it! You brought back our
precious Star Rod! I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

We will use it to bring peace
back to this world. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now we'll be able to grant
everyone's wishes again!♥

All of this is thanks to you,
Mario!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When you look at the night sky,
you'll know that the glittering
stars are praising you for your
courage.  

Look upon their bright light and
remember our thanks!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You really took it to Bowser,
Mario! Really socked it to him!
What impressive strength!

I knew you could do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
Don't think we don't know how
hard you worked for all of us.  

It must have been difficult.
We won't forget your efforts.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I hope Bowser learned something
from all this. Maybe he'll behave
himself now...

Although I'd say the chances of
that are pretty slim.
Tsk tsk... Ah well...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No words can express completely
how thankful we are for all that
you've done.

Hope has returned, both to Star
Haven and to all of the Mushroom
Kingdom.
We're in your debt, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And Twink, may I say...
you really rose to the occasion!

You've proven yourself to be a
grown-up Star!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tee hee hee... Aw, go on...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well...
I think it's time we returned to
Star Haven.

All of the stars are waiting for
us there, no doubt.

It's time to say good-bye for
now, Mario!
May the stars forever shine
brightly upon you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
I'd like to thank you, too.

And Princess Peach...
It was an honor to help you in
your time of need.

I hope...maybe...to see you again
sometime...

For now I'm going to become a
respectable Star and make
people's wishes come true!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you so much for helping me,
Twink.
You've always been a stellar
friend to me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach...

I... I...

Well, no, never mind!
I have to go, too!

Thank you very much, Mario.
I'll always remember you, 
Princess Peach!

Good-bye...!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... Ohhh. So that's it, huh?
That's how you took the Star
Rod back from Bowser. 

It seems like another wild
adventure's in the books, bro.

The castle's back in its normal
place and everyone's returned
home safely...

You came through in the end,
just like you always do!

... I know you've been back for
days now, but I'll bet you still
kind of feel like you're on an
adventure. Don't you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That reminds me... The pals who
traveled with you...
I wonder what they're up to
now...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey Parakarry, what's up?

I thought you were back at work
delivering letters.  
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha ha ha! I sure am!
This isn't a social call!

I dropped by to bring a letter
to you, Goombario!
It's from Princess Peach.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh? From Princess Peach!?
Whoa!
What's she writing to me for?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Read it and find out! I've got
to deliver more letters!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks, Parakarry! See ya!
Keep working hard, buddy!
Take care!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Goombario!
What did Princess Peach write in
her letter? Lemme see!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hang on, Goombaria...

Jeepers!
This is an invitation to a party!
At the castle!

It says the princess is having
a party and I'm invited to go
have fun!
Whoa! Whoa! WHOOAAAAA!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now then, gentlemen...
It's time to scale the frosty
heights to the Crystal Palace!

Kooper, old boy,
you're in charge of guiding us.

Your prior experience is terribly
important to the success of our
expedition!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah! Leave it to me!
I know the place front to back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kooper!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
Parakarry?
What brings you here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew! ...I finally made it.

I have a letter for you from
Princess Peach.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Oh, wow!
This is an invitation to a huge
party at Princess Peach's
Castle!

It's directly from the princess
herself! It's got her signature
on it and everything! Cool!

Oh, there's no way I can miss a
bash this big! But...

...but I can't just turn my back
on this expedition after I
promised Prof. Kolorado...

I should stay here and...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, poppycock! Balderdash!
Don't be daft, dear boy!

Turning down such an invitation
would be terribly impolite.
This is a golden opportunity!

Go to the party this instant!
Don't spare me another thought!

It would ruin the party if the
hero of Koopa Village...
nay, the hero of the Mushroom
Kingdom wasn't even there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...
I knew you'd say that, Prof.
Kolorado!
You're so kind and generous!

I'll do it! I hope you guys will be
all right without me!
I'm gonna party!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Kolorado, I have a message
for you as well...,

Don't bother coming back home,
you wandering buffoon!!!
What a no-good husband!

...That...
was a message from your wife.

Kolorado... You set out on this
expedition without telling your
wife again, didn't you?

Boy, she was sooo furious.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh good gracious...

Pa puh puh puh...
Parakarry!
Why in the world didn't you tell
me this first!

This is a crisis, old boy!
I must away back home with all
due speed! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
Did you hear something outside?
I think I did.
I'll go take a quick look.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, bro, guess what?
Parakarry stopped by to drop
off a party invitation from
Princess Peach.

He said that he's also invited to
the party, so he took off and
said he'd see us at the castle
when we arrived.

Now, we'd better go, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK... Listen, Mario.
I'm just gonna run ahead.
There's something important
that I have to do. 

What is it?
Sorry, bro... It's top secret!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The kids went ahead with their
dear old Goompa.

Goombaria's jumping for joy!
Dear, dear... Ha ha ha!
Kids are bundles of energy,
aren't they?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hello, Mario!
I've never been to a party at a
castle before! I'm petrified!

It's really... Oh, dear!
I'm so nervous! Do I look OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I just arrived at Toad Town.
What a long walk! I've been
taking a little rest.

Goompa must be feeling spry!
He went ahead with the
grandkids already!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kaaaawiiiiiizzz!!
It's your old pal, Chuck Quizmo!

How'd you like to take part in
the quiz game?

Nah... Just kidding!
Let's just enjoy the party!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Mario, isn't it?
Cough hack cough...

You did a brilliant job of
defeating Bowser.

The whole town is celebrating
your masterful battle...
But even glad news shouldn't be
cause for missing training!

Lee and Chan want to take a
day off from their training to
go to the party...
Truly an outrageous notion!!

...But still...
Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh.
Well, a LITTLE fun can't hurt...
cough cough cough...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's go to the party!

I've heard there'll be a parade!
Let's find a good spot to see
the princess from!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, today we shall forget
about training and celebrate!

Yahoo!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Sorry, Mario!
The shop's closed today.
Nobody would buy anything on
a day like today anyway.

The shopkeepers want to hang
out and enjoy the festival, too,
you know!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I love it when Toad Town is full
of party-goers!

I'm going to talk to as many of
them as I can!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, where are you going?
I'm sure that Princess Peach is
waiting for you in the castle!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The castle has come back!
Everything's back to normal,
thanks to you, Mario!

Look at this place! Toad Town
is hopping 'cause so many people
are here to celebrate!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Big news, everyone, huge news!
Mario, who defeated the vile
Bowser, has just arrived!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!!
Let's hear it for Mario!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Peach's Castle has come back
at last, and peace has been 
restored to Toad Town.

Now we can spend our days
together without fear!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, I'm so happy!♥
But I work at the castle...
so I must return there.

Such is the sweet sadness of
love, my darling!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! I am just SO relieved that
Princess Peach and everybody
else came back safe and sound!
Really!

Oh, and those three young maids
who work at the castle...the ones
who went traveling? Well, they're
totally back, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, I heard that, too!

They had to go right back to
work this morning. They've been
working all day setting up for
the party!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's really great that things
worked out OK for everybody!

And those three maids brought
back lots of souvenirs for me
to look at, so I, Felissa T., am
so happy!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wish we Toads could have done
more than just wish for you.

But we followed your progress
the whole time. Your efforts
really gave us hope.

All of Toad Town thanks you!
It must have been grueling...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, back to work, I guess...
I'm not all that excited to get
back to the grind, but it is
somehow a relief. 

After all, having a routine is
probably for the best.
At least for me it is...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm so happy that Princess
Peach's Castle is back, but...

my darling must return to work.
It's going to be lonely here...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Dad!
You have to go back to work
starting tomorrow? 

Aw, lame! Now we won't be able
to play together every day!
What a bummer...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Next time something happens to
Princess Peach, I'm gonna be
the one to protect her!

I'm gonna be a guard in the
castle and I'm gonna punch the
bad guys in the nose and I'm
gonna tell them to GET OUT!

I'm gonna do it all by myself!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Hey, Mario!
Taking your time on the way to
the party, huh?

Don't dally too long! It's going
to be quite an exciting day!
I can hardly wait!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
  ♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Greetings, old boy!
Here for the festivities at the
castle, eh?

I can't say I'm terribly excited
about it, myself.
My heart yearns to go to the
Crystal Palace! Yearns, I say!

So many mysteries await me and
my dizzying intellect...

Oh, the pain of it all...
You understand my yearning,
don't you, old boy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I swear, Kolorado, you are the
living end!
You're always darting here and
there instead of settling down...

Mario, would you believe I had
to send Parakarry to get him?

I'm at the end of my rope!
Please talk some sense into him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who's that? Is it Mario?
Why, it's me, Koopa Koot.

By the way, where's the castle?

I haven't been there for a while,
and I'm having the darnedest
time even finding the front
door!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

  Merlon isn't here now! Go away!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, bud,
long time no see!

I made some serious dough here
selling Badges, so I'm gonna
clear out and head for a
different town.

I'm kinda itching to get on the
road right now, but...
This festival is a big deal...

and my kid really wants to check
it out. So I guess we'll stay for
a while longer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a festival! Yeah!!
A festival!
What fun!! Wheeeee!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm making a bouquet for
Princess Peach.

It seems as though extra-
beautiful flowers have bloomed
just for this special day.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, hello. I'm awfully sorry, but
the post office will be closed
for the festivities.

Oh, is that you, Mario?
I haven't thanked you for looking
out for Parakarry.

What I don't understand...
is how such an addle-brained
character could make himself
useful on your adventure...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good afternoon, Mario.
Toad House is closed today.

We deserve a day off to
celebrate, don't we?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
On behalf of all of Flower Fields,
I came here to say thank you.

This is all thanks to you, Mario.
Thank you, Mario!
Thank you so very much!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You made it, Mario!
You're truly our hero!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I hope you got your rest, Mario.
There's no time to sleep today!
After all, it's a celebration.

It's time to party into the wee
hours of the morning with all of
our friends! Yeeeeeah!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, where are you going?
Princess Peach is waiting for you
up at the castle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach has returned.

Oh I'm so happy,...
I feared she was lost forever!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bowser'll be better behaved now,
won't he, Mario?

I hope so, because I'd just lose
it if something terrible happened
again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, where are you going?
I'm sure the princess is waiting
for you up at the castle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've been watching Minh T.'s
flower garden, you know.
Everyday, it gets more and more
happy and beautiful.

And now that the castle's back,
Minh T. looks happy as well.

Just looking at Minh T. makes
me feel so...happy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach has come back
safely. Oh joy.
I'm so happy. I'm ecstatic.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bombette!! Oh, Bombette!
Where have you been, Bombette?

I followed you, but in vain!!
What a coldhearted, cruel girl
you are...

You left me behind...!
How could you!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, Mario, I hear you defeated
Bowser at last.

It must have been quite an
adventure for you.
Sounds tiring to me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!?
Wow! Hello!
I'm so pleased to meet you!

Now when I get back to Dry Dry
Outpost I can brag to my
friends that I met you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've never seen a house with a
spinning roof before.

Wow....
This Toad Town is a really
amazing place, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tra la la la♪
Mi mi mi miiiii♪

Oh, I'm so very nervous! What
if I don't sing well for the
princess?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Pop Diva's nerves are shot.
Stage fright is what she's got.
Will she sing well or not?

Why the worry? Why the frown?
Everyone's happy! Party down!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, I'm feeling goooood!♪

I never realized that this Toad
Town was such a hip, happening
place! 

Sing! Dance!! Party!!!
Life is so beautiful!♪
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! It's Mario.
I thank you again for everything
you did for our village.

Hmmm?
You wonder how I got here?

I befriended a strange whale.
It ferried me over here.

Next time, I'd like to bring the
whole village with me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like today's party'll be
even better than the last one!
Lots of singing and dancing
instead of an earthquake...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
How are you? Still dangerous?
Ho ho ho ho ho...aaaanyway.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If it isn't the nice guy!
You made it after all, yes?

I, Moustafa, knew all along that
you would defeat the evil Bowser.
Yes, I did.

But you know what?
You are an even greater hero
than I imagined.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
Our wishes were granted! The
castle has come back and things
are as they were before!

I'm so glad that the princess
and all the other people who got
kidnapped are safe!
What a miracle!

You know, this is all thanks to
you, Mario.

How can we ever thank you...
We're all in your debt.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wel... Wel... Welco...
Welcome to Peach's Castle!

To... to... to...
Today we have many special
guests, so I'm very nervous...
My heart's pounding...

Thump thump thump thump...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome, Mario.

Thank you for waiting,
everybody!
Please proceed to the castle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where are you going, Mario?
Princess Peach awaits you in the
castle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I came here so I could see Lady
Bow dressed up in all her finery.

I know Princess Peach is
beautiful, but...
Lady Bow is even prettier!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi! I've come here as an
attendant to Mr. Moustafa.

The rumors of your great
accomplishments have spread
even to Dry Dry Outpost.

You're truly amazing.
Well done!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
After this splendid party, we're
going to have a wedding ceremony
at Gusty Gulch.

It's going to be the most
Boo-tiful wedding ever! We'll
scare everybody!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow... everything on this shore is
so new to me.

I wish the other guys could've
come along, as well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's Mario!
Hello again!

You've gotta come back to visit
Lavalava Island again!
Everybody's been wanting to see
you, Mario!

I guess maybe everybody on
Lavalava Island oughtta come
over here, huh?

There's a lot of crazy stuff
around here! We could sure have
some fun exploring!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've heard all about...
the story of your adventure!

It's a spectacular story full of
romance, courage and thrills!

Herringway said he definitely
wants to write your story.

He even came up with a title...
What was it again? Let's see...
Well...

"Paper Mario"!!
What do you think!!??
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Being locked in that prison cell
just seems like a bad dream to
me now.

Everything worked out fine!
It's so great!!
Thank you, Mario!

Now all I want to do is sit down
and eat shaved ice treats all
day and all night...
until I'm completely stuffed!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
welcome to the castle.

Princess Peach should be here 
very shortly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And now... Princess Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Greetings to all of you!
I'm so glad everyone could be
here on this special day.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Star Rod stolen by Bowser
has been returned to its
rightful place in Star Haven.

Peace has once again returned
to the Mushroom Kingdom.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Above us, the stars shine with
more beauty and power than
ever before. It seems that
they're sending us their thanks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario, Kooper,
Bombette, Parakarry,...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bow, Watt,
Sushie, Lakilester,
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
and everybody across the lands
of the Mushroom Kingdom,
we've regained peace because of
all your efforts.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you very much, indeed.
I appreciate it from the bottom
of my heart.

I hope that the Mushroom Kingdom
will enjoy peace and prosperity
for a long time to come.
Perhaps forever!

This is my heartfelt wish.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So, let's celebrate!

Enjoy the festivities, everyone!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Shy Guy took over my shop!
My precious shop...

Please, Mr. Mario!
Get the Shy Guy out of my shop!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tee hee hee hee!
Welcome to Shy Guy's Shop.

Too bad I'm not gonna sell
anything to you, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no...  Poor me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!!
Way to show that little hooligan
a thing or two!

Hooray! Thank you so much!
I'm still giving great deals at
rock-bottom prices, so don't be
a stranger around here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, salutations.
You are Mario, are you not?

Of course I know who you are.
I'm the wise Toad, Russ T.
Pleasure meeting you.

As you can probably tell, I love
books and read all the time.
Because I'm so well read, I know
all sorts of interesting facts.

Whenever you visit with me,
I'll be happy to share all of
my knowledge with you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you talking to me because
you crave knowledge that only 
my intellect can provide?
Then, how about this...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Seeking information again,
are we, Mario?
I once told you about this,
but perhaps you've forgotten.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

If there's anything else you
wish to know, please feel free
to ask me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... Yes... Well...
It seems I've told you all I
know right now...

I used to know a lot more, but I
suppose I've forgotten some.

I'll try my best to recall more,
so come see me in a little while.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aargh! Words are mocking me!
I need that Dictionary!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Curses!  Mario...

A Shy Guy stole my Dictionary.

Please get it back from him!
I'm... I'm losing IQ points!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To think of my lovely Dictionary
in that Shy Guy's hands...
Please get it back for me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No?
Mario, how could you?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My Dictionary!
Oh, wonderful words!
Many thanks, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You'd like me to translate this
note for you?

Let's see...
Ah ha! It seems to be written in
the language of the Shy Guys.

Let's see here...yes...accents...
...mmm...silent "d", hmmm...

Yes. It says, "Hit yellow,
green, red, and then blue."

What an odd thing to write down.
Any idea what it's about?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You'd like me to translate this
note for you?

Let's see...
Ah ha! It seems to be written in
the language of the Shy Guys.

Well, this would be an easy task
if I still had my Dictionary,
but the Shy Guys stole it.

I'll tell you what: I'll take
care of the note for now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
"Hit yellow, green, red, and
then blue."

Hmm... That's what the Shy Guy's
note says.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You are Mr. Russ T., correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now what could this be about...
Hm! How exceedingly strange.
It's from Lavalava Island.

...Yes, yes.  It's a question
from a curious kid there.

My mind is quite in demand.
Thank you, Parakarry. I thank
you for your quick delivery.

I don't usually accept
questions, but oh, well...

It's from a kid, and we must
educate the younger generation.
When I was a child, I had a
curious mind as well. Still do!

I'll get right on the answer.

Thanks again for bringing this
letter such a long way.
Please take this as thanks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Above us, on the top floor,
there is a Dojo.
We are here! Always!
Training at the Dojo!

Unless our Master isn't here,
in which case the Dojo's closed.

A letter just arrived saying
The Master will return soon.
We will train again soon!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Our Master is wandering 
the world to purify his mind
and train his body.

Our Master was a strong man.
He is going to come back
a very, very strong man.

We will wait here, right here,
until our Master returns.
Waiting is part of our training.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you must be...Mario.
Welcome to my Dojo.

I am The Master.
I am the head of this Dojo.

...cough hack cough...

wheeze...
Please pardon me.
My health is rather delicate...

Every day we train in this Dojo
to improve body and mind.

If you have the purpose and the
desire, you may challenge us.

Tell me, what business have you
here today?
...cough...hack...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Cough...hack...
Ah, Mario,
welcome to our Dojo.

For what purpose did you
come here today?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Very well. Please feel free to
observe our training.
Wheeze...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Our doors are always open
to you, so come anytime.
Cough cough...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When fighting, you must try
many tactics. A good fighter
does not use the same simple
attack each time.

Each enemy has its own 
character and weak points.

Sometimes you use your body...
Sometimes you use your items...
but always, ALWAYS you must 
use your mind.

Sometimes you will be surprised
by what's effective.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A wise fighter knows that
sometimes the best tactic is
not to fight at all.

There is no cowardice in
choosing to run away from a
superior foe.

Of course, you will find some 
enemies that are impossible to
escape, once in battle.
Face them with bravery.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Very well.
Then Chan will fight you.

Now, Chan.
It is time for you to fight Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
As you say, Master!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
Here comes Chan the man!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow...
How dishonorable!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm...
You have some skills.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
prepare to be finished!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Enough!
The winner is Mario.

Chan, you must train harder.

Very well.
I give you this, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Very well.
This time, Lee will fight you.

Now, Lee...
Let me see how you handle Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Certainly, sir!
I will defeat him, Master!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have at you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I bet you've never seen a move
like this before!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh... You are strong, 
I'll give you that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
now I will finish you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Enough!
Mario is the winner.

Lee,
you have much training to do.

Very well.
I give you this, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Very well!
It's time you fought The Master.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Very well!  Mario...
I will fight you again.

I will not go easy on you
this time, however.
You must concentrate fully if
you hope to compete.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Very well!
I will fight you once more.

This time, I will hold nothing
back at all.
Do you believe you're ready?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To battle!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Foolish! That won't work on me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm!
Excellent move.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You have natural talent.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
I'm afraid I must finish you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you will fall!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can't defeat me like that!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm!
Nice maneuver.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't lose your concentration.
I have yet to truly begin
fighting back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
Is this your best?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kwaaaaa!
Behold my fury, Mario!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You foolish novice!
Do you think you can beat me
with sloppy technique like that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm!
You have great hidden strength
for one clothed like a plumber.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now...it is time I stopped
being so merciful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hyaaahhhh!!!
Mario!
Survive this if you can!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You underestimate me, Mario!
Did you really think you'd win?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm...
I see why you are so famous, 
Mario. You are truly a 
masterful fighter.

Very well, worthy adversary.
I give you this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm...
That was a solid fight.

Very well.
I give you this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm!
Noble Mario!

You have bested me, The Master,
the strongest of fighters!

Since you have beaten me at
my full strength, I give you
this with respect.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You are welcome to train here
with us anytime.
Cough...wheeze...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm...
You lack strength.

You have skill, though.
Please return here after you
have trained some more.
Cough...hack...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Cough cough...
Mario, you have already proven
yourself stronger than me.

You should train by yourself 
out in the wide world.

I also need to...
keep on training. Wheeze...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The earthquake when the castle
flew away was terrifying!

Everything was shaking...
the ground...the houses...
I fell right over!

It was so horrifying...
that I'd just like to forget
it ever happened.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Toad Town without a castle...
It just doesn't seem right.
Less castle-filled, somehow.

Do you think it'll ever be 
like the old days around here?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Since I worked at the castle,
I have nothing to do for a while.

You'd think that'd be relaxing.
But this house isn't exactly
restful during the day.

My wife doesn't even have any
spare time to spend with me.

She works all day cleaning
stuff up and dealing with
the kids. It must be tough,
doing all that work.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think it's time I stopped
moping around about the castle
being stolen.

My wife is busy working, so...
I guess I'll go on a walk with
my children.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Take off, you lousy Shy Guy!
I don't care how convincing
your Mario disguise is!

You aren't getting in!
Stay away from my family!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We've been cooped up too long
for fear of those dastardly
Shy Guy troublemakers.
We need some exercise.

It's high time we went on a
family walk, I think. The kids
should stretch their legs.

There's nothing like a bit
of fresh air and exercise to
revitalize the spirit!

I've begun helping my wife with
the chores.

...I'm thinking that the work
I did at the castle was much
easier than this.

I have to get down on my knees

I've begun helping my wife with
the chores.

...I'm thinking that the work
I did at the castle was much
easier than this.

I've been playing this strange
game with my children.
It's pretty difficult.

The kids say I stink at it, too!
Those rascals...

They have a surprise coming...
I've been practicing at night!

Don't tell! I can't wait to
show them all up!

Mario...
My family means more to me than
anything in the world.

I can't be a hero like you,
but as a father and husband,
I'm doing my best.

Good luck to you, Mario.
My entire family is cheering
for your success!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, busy, busy!
The room doesn't get tidied
up when my darling's at home.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, how busy, busy!
My sweetheart might have
some time off from work,
but I never have a day off.

It's a lot of work!

Aw... Look at my poor dear.
I know he's sad that the castle
is gone, but grieving forever
won't do anything.

He should try to find something
that brings him joy.
If you could, please say
something to him, Mario.

I used to love the annual
cooking contest at the castle,
but it looks like we won't have
one this year...

I was sure this was the year
I'd beat Tayce T.!

My darling's spirits seem to
have improved lately.

Maybe he realized there was
no sense in staying home and
grieving all the time.

My darling is a bit timid,
but he is such a good-natured
person at heart.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like the Shy Guys
won't be pestering the town
anymore, will they?

I know they're just pranksters,
but I still feared for the
children while they were loose.

But... My sweetie-pie protected
the family! And he looked
so cute being brave!♥

Oh, sorry! How embarrassing!
Don't tell my darling that
I said that, all right?

You're in my way, sugar!
Scoot over!

Oh, gracious! Mario?
Tee hee... How embarrassing!
I'm awfully sorry.

I thought you were my darling.
That's why I shouted.

Even with all that's going on
in the world, you can't stop
cleaning your house.
It sure is tiresome, though...

My dumpling's always playing
games with the children.

When he used to go to the
castle every day for work,

I would sometimes wish to the
Stars that the family could
be together more often.

I didn't think it would be
like this!
It's like I have three children
instead of two!

Her Highness would be worried!

My dad works at the castle,
so he's not at home usually.

But now the castle's gone,
so he's at home.

When I said I'm glad 'cause
Dad's at home, I got scolded.

...What's up with that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When the castle was still here,
I used to climb the trees
and look off into the distance.

But those trees all fell down...
Now there's nothing to do.

Since the castle is gone,

You never realize how much work

Mario!
I'm so glad you're OK!

The town is in an uproar!

Please, Mario!
Save Her Highness!

The road in front of the Toad
House connects to scenic
Pleasant Path.

But I heard that there are
weird Toads blocking the way.

Who could they be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The weird Toads were actually
guys called Koopa Bros.?

Is that bad?

I guess these Koopa Bros. are
loyal to Bowser?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that the train
can't move.
Folks are saying that a giant
boulder is blocking the tracks.

If only there were some way
of destroying it, we could
travel by rail again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
People are saying that the
train started moving again.
Now folks can go to Mt. Rugged!

I'll tell you, it's tough to travel
if the train won't move.

Mario!
Grr...rrrr...
Just a second ago, a Shy Guy
ran into Russ T.'s house!

Eek... What should we do...
Um...er...
Do something, please!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, that wily Shy Guy!
He stole Russ T.'s Dictionary!

Russ T. really loved that
Dictionary, too. LOVED it.
Poor Russ T....

You're his only hope, Mario!
Get it back for him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You were able to get Russ T.'s
Dictionary back?
Whoa! Way to go, Mario!

Russ T. must be overjoyed.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lavalava Island?
It's an island in the sea way
south of Toad Town, isn't it?

Folks say there's a volcano
on the island that could erupt
any time now. If it does,
you'll sure see some lavalava!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're going to go to
Lavalava Island?

You have heard about the 
volcano, right? The one that
people say could blow at
any moment?

Do you really think it's safe
to go there?
OK...but travel carefully.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario, Minh T. would
like you to lend her a hand.
She runs the flower garden.

Flower Fields, a land covered
in flowers, is supposedly in
grave danger.

I told her I'd send you over
to her to learn more.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's going on in Flower Fields?
Bad trouble?

I guess we're not the only 
folks who have problems.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder how Princess Peach
and the others in the castle
are doing?
You think they're...suffering?

I wish things would go back to 
normal again so that we could 
all live in peace.

Mario...
you're the only one we can
truly rely on.

I know there's not much we can
do to help, but we'll be rooting
for you always.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario,
did you know you can
carry up to 10 items?

When you can't carry any more
items, it's a good idea to
go to a shop like this and 
ask them to hold items for you.

You can even claim the items
at any other shop.
Pretty convenient, huh?

Pleasant Path, there are many
loyal Koopa Bros. followers.

The Mushrooms and Fire Flowers
you can buy at a shop will help
you survive.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey... I bet you didn't know
that there's another shop
here in Toad Town.

The merchandise they carry
is slightly different.
You might want to check it out
sometime.

would have ghosts in it.
How scary...

Of course, I'd heard there were
lots of them deep within
Forever Forest, but not here!

I'd never go wandering in there,
not for a million coins.
Brrrrrr...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I just saw some Shy Guys go by.
I'd bet anything that they're
up to no good again.

Who knows where they went,
but wherever they are, I'm sure
they're causing trouble.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Russ T.'s Dictionary was stolen!
Can you believe it?

Somebody ought to stop those
guys before they strike again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You got Russ T.'s Dictionary
back? Wow!

Mario, you're the best!
He must have been really happy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you keep using one favorite
item all the time?

It's fine to have favorites,
but you really should experiment
with other items. You might just
find one that's even cooler.

Oh, no! Doom! Danger!
Princess Peach's Castle has
flown away, up into the sky!

No castle! Horrors!
Only a hole remains!
Our beloved castle! Where is it?

Spread the word! Outrage!

Oh, no! Danger!
Strange Toads are about in
front of the Toad House!

They don't look trustworthy!
Beware, people, beware!

Big news, people!
The Koopa Bros. are running
rampant at the end of our
Pleasant Path!

They fight for Bowser!
There's even word that they
work poor, innocent Bob-ombs
like slave drivers.

Mario's going to kick their
shells in! Just wait!
Attention, people! Listen up!

Oh, ill news!
Dry Dry Railroad is not running!

Oh, no. Oh, ruin!
Big problem, people!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen up, people!

Dry Dry Railroad started
working again!

Mario got rid of the rock
that blocked the way!

We can go to Mt. Rugged now!
Good news! Fortune! Joy!

Oh, fright! Spooky news!
A Boo has been sighted in town
near Forever Forest!

I didn't actually see it

Someone must gather special
seeds to help Flower Fields!

A door has appeared in

The castle was taken away, and
Princess Peach was kidnapped.
These are dark days.

Everyone in town is suffering,

nothing but you, my sweet.

Does that make me wicked?

My heart is the same, my love.
It cares for you, none other.

Hey, have you heard?
Some Toads I've never seen
before are blocking the road!

They're keeping Mario from
going on his adventure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?  What?  Really?

Why are they bothering Mario?
Are they nuts?

There's something weird 
going on here--I know it.

I, Felissa T., don't understand
what's going on!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, have you heard?

Those weird Toads who were
blocking the road were actually
disguised Koopa Bros.

Merlon saw right through them.
He figured it out instantly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow!♥ That's super!
Merlon is so super. Really!
He knows everything.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He knows everything?

So... You think Merlon can
find out about the secret place
where I hide candy?

Oh, no!
What should I do!

I heard that the three maid
girls of Princess Peach's Castle
are going to go on a trip.

I guess they don't have work,
but really! The princess was
kidnapped, and times are bad!

What on earth are those maids
thinking?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, I agree with you.
Going on a trip during a
situation like this?
Have they lost it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Totally, girls.
I, Felissa T., agree.

I think they should think
especially hard about
which souvenirs to buy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

are going to go on a trip.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, don't you think
there have been fewer
stars in the sky lately?

You know, with so few stars,
everybody's wishes aren't
going to come true.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, totally.
You think that Bowser found a
way to steal our stars?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no. I hope not!
I have soooo many wishes.

Mostly I want some cool boots!

Please give me cool boots.
Please give me cool boots.
Please give me cool boots!

I won't wish for anything else!
Tee hee!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaagh!  I've had it!
Why do Shy Guys have to be
such pains?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah! Really! I used to think
their tricks were cute...
but this is too much.

I sense something fishy.
Something weird is definitely
going on around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?!
Something fishy?!

Sniff-sniff-sniff!
I don't smell any fish.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that someone saw a
huge monster at the port.

I think it's some kind of
giant, scary fish that rose
from the deep sea.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kris T., you're priceless.
I bet you're right.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you think?

I, Felissa T., thought it was
just a poor troubled whale.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Can you believe that the monster
at the port really turned out
to be a whale?

I bet that thing would've
caused big problems if Mario
hadn't helped it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario's so super!
He notices things other people
totally miss.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, it was a whale!
I'd like to take a ride on
a whale sometime.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, girls, something's
been bothering me...

Why was I born so beautiful?
Ooh, beauty is a sin!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nice ego, Kris T.! Really!
Way to be in love with yourself!
Sometimes you make absolutely
no sense at all!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, people like me
because I'm always cheerful!♥
Who cares about looks?♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that Mario went to
Flower Fields.

I guess he's going to save some
flowers or something.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You go, Mario! Woo-hoo!
Beat up that stupid Bowser!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm rooting for you too, Mario.
I put together a little dance
number to cheer you on!

Umm...
Sorry. I can't dance when
people are looking.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's been quite a while since
Princess Peach and the others
in the castle were abducted.

I wonder how they're doing?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I hope they're treating
Princess Peach OK.

Do you think Her Highness
has enough to eat?
I'm really worried.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I want to take something for 
those people to eat.

If I could somehow float up to
the sky and...
...no, it's impossible!

Waaaaah!! 
I, Felissa T., am so useless!

Let's cheer him on!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, Mario! You rock! 
Good luck!!

The stars are now in reach,
so save our Princess Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm cheering you on, too.
M-a-a-r-r-i-o-o-o!
Gooood luck! Woo!

I'm rooting for you!
I, Felissa T., will cheer for you
without rest!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You are Miss T., correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly received.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who is this from?
I don't think I recognize the
return address.

Oh, well. I'm always getting 
love letters from strangers.  
I'm super popular.

But enough about me. 
It's so lucky you came just now,
Mr. Postman!

Will you do me a favor?
I want you to deliver this
letter to the shop owner at
Dry Dry Outpost.♥

I order lots of things from
the desert.
They have so much good stuff!

It's not easy staying this
beautiful. It takes work!
Will you please deliver this?

Thanks!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, have you gone back
to your house yet?
Luigi was wondering how you
were doing.

You can go home through that
pipe in front of the main gate
over there.

You can enter the pipe by
standing on the edge and
pushing down on the Control Stick.

Say, why don't you give me
a tour of your house someday?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Master of the Dojo came
back from his training.

Before he left, he said he
wouldn't return until he was
incredibly strong.
He must be pretty tough by now.

Two Shy Guys just ran by!

One seems to have invaded the
shop over there.
The owner was not happy!

I have no idea where the other
one went.
Those guys can disappear in the
blink of an eye.

I bet they're still around here...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, I'm getting pretty
fed up with these Shy Guys.

They didn't use to be such a
big nuisance to the town.

Little pranks are one thing,
but when you start stealing
people's precious treasures,
that's just wrong.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you're really showing
those Shy Guys a thing or two!

Things just seem to work out
when you're around.

You'll be able to beat Bowser
and save the princess soon,
don't you think?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you heard about the
monster at the port?

Everyone is pretty shook up.

But I'm not.
I know you'll take care of it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
People's wishes haven't been
coming true lately.

It seems like right now,
only the bad guys' wishes are
coming true.

Is it all in my head?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
May I ask you something, Mario?
Why don't you just go save the
princess right now?

I thought you had a long history
of beating up Bowser...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
May I ask you something, Mario?
Why don't you just go save the
princess right now?

I thought you had a long history
of beating up Bowser...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario... Is it...
Is it tougher this time to
take on Bowser? Is he somehow
stronger than before?

Is that why you're having to
work so hard?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I heard you're going
to the far north.
Bring a sweater or something.

And be careful! It's dangerous!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I heard you're going
to storm Bowser's Castle.
There's not much that I can do,
but I'll be cheering you on.

I wish I were a hero like you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh?...Ha ha ha!
You don't have it?

The Degree, Mario.
The Degree shows how strong
you are.
Ha ha ha... I have it.

I fought at the Dojo over there
and got it from The Master.
I am one bad Toad!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, that's...
a First-Degree Card!

I have one, too. See?
A First-Degree Card!!

That means I'm as strong 
as you! Cool! I'm bad! Yeah!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, that's...
a Second-Degree Card?

Whoa! Cool!
You fought your way to
a Second-Degree Card?
Mario, you're awesome!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, that's...
a Third-Degree Card?

Whoa! Wow! Whoop!
I knew you were strong!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, that's...
a Fourth-Degree Card!

Whoa! Amazing!
You rule, Mario!
You must be crazy strong!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! Can it be? That's...
a Diploma???

Whooooopeee!  
It's real, isn't it?

You defeated The Master! Wow!
You're the best, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aargh!
No more time!

Too bad!!
Please try again next time.

See you at the next
trading event, all right?
So long!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello!
I'm the Toad of the
trading event. How are you?
Did you bring the item?

No?
You don't have anything?

Look, I can't trade with you
unless you bring the item
I told you to bring.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello!
I'm the Toad of the
trading event. How are you?
Did you bring the item?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Congratulations!

This is the item for today!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Use it wisely!

See you again at the next
trading event!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wrong! Sorry.
That's not the right item.

As a penalty, I'm afraid I'll
have to confiscate this item.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello?
You don't want the item?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, what's up?
Good to meet ya, bud.

Rowf's the name.
I'm starting me up a little
business in Toad Town.

I'm still setting up, though.

I wanna see you back in here
when we open, all right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stop by again after we open,
OK, buddy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sorry, bud.
Still a few things to set up.

Come by later, all right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Welcome, buddy!
Well, we got it open!
What do you think?
Pretty spectacular shop, huh?

How about buying something?

Just press {A} in front of a
Badge you want to buy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, bud! How ya been?
Take a look around.
I wanna see you walk out
of here with something.

Just press {A} in front of a
Badge you want to buy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sorry, bud...nothing new...
This is all I have today.

I'm expecting another shipment,
so come on back later.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, buddy...
I'm cleaned out!
I've got nothing more to sell!

You were one serious repeat
customer, bud! 
I can practically retire now!

This town was real nice...
but I think I'll take a trip.
Thanks, bud! You're the man!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! You! You little scamp!
Get your hands off...
Give me back my Calculator!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sorry, bud.
I had to close up shop.

Some idiot Shy Guy stole
my Calculator. You believe that?

I need that thing to calculate
sales, bud! I'm not a genius!
When I find that little punk...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, buddy!
Isn't that my Calculator?!

You're telling me...you got
it back from the Shy Guys?

Yeah! In your face, Shy Guy!
I can open my shop again!

Oh, man, how can I repay you?
I know! Take this!
This is a special Badge, bud,
so use it with care.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks to you I can finally
open my shop again.

I'll be up and running in
no time flat.
Come back soon, bud.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey!
That wasn't my Calculator?

It looked just like mine...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, mister.
You're a customer, aren't you?

Dad's preparing to open the
shop soon, so I guess you
gotta wait a little while.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome, mister.
Press {A} in front of a Badge
you want, if there is one.
It's easy!

You should buy a lot and
spend a lot of coins because
Badges are really neat.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm a good boy because I
help my dad every day.

Like my dad says, business is
a lot of work, but it pays off
in the end.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dad says we're closing and
moving to another town.

See ya, mister.
Thanks for shopping so much.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Shy Guy just stole
Dad's Calculator.

You should've heard what my
dad said! We can't open now!

Stupid Shy Guy!
Give back Dad's Calculator!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dad says we would've gone
out of business if we hadn't
gotten that Calculator back.

We can open the shop again!
All because of you!
Thank you, mister!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We can open the shop again!
Back in business!
Thank you, mister!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, mister!

My dad's opened his shop.
Don't you wanna take a look?
It's really cool.

It's a Badge shop. For Badges.
Come on, check it out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We have lots of rare Badges,
so take a verrrry close look.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, Mario!

The Toad House's slogan is...
"Refresh your Body and Soul!"

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Really?
You seem to be in fine shape.
Are you sure you want to take
a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Sleep well!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Now that your body and soul
are refreshed, your travels
will seem much easier.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Toad House's slogan is...
"Refresh your Body and
Soul!"... But...

it's impossible to get refreshed
with this Shy Guy jumping all
over the place. Sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now that the Shy Guys are
gone, you can stay here.
Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Merlon is out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I said Merlon is out, so he
must be out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm telling you,
Merlon is out!!! Ouuut!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Merlon is out!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why do you keep on knocking?
I'm telling you he's out!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What the...?
Why is someone sleeping in
front of my house?

Wait a minute...
That face seems verrry
familiar to me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Maybe...
No... Yes! It must be!
You're Mario!

I've been waiting for you!

You should've come earlier!
Well, you're here now. Come in.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where to begin...?
My name...is Merlon.
I am a wizard.

When I was reading the stars
the other day, an oracle
came to me.

What I discovered is very
important, and it concerns you.

But, before I tell you about it,
there are other things of which
I must speak.

It is a very long story, but
I'll try to shorten it.
Where should I start...?

It was in the old days.
One of my ancestors was up
on Shooting Star Summit
and as usual.....

......but one day it happened.
...suddenly...a great...
...appeared and I...
...standing face to face...

Then, the faraway....
the pious...
was....raised me up...
.....was amazing..

..I was still so young then...
I believed in .........
But....our hearts were.....

...........
and...........
.....then....
...........so......

........
...................
.....  ..........
...  ..........

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

...........................
.................
.........................
...................

......................
.............
.........................
..and that is all that matters.

Huh?! Hey, 
Mario!
Were you listening to me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...all right.

...So, anyway, that is why
I am able to help you.

If you get lost during
your adventure, you
can come to me.

I can predict the path
you should take for
a small price.

Right now, your main goal
must be to save Princess Peach
as quickly as is humanly
possible, but...

according to my second sight,
your path must first take you
to the great fortress of the
Koopa Bros.

To reach the Koopa Bros.
Fortress, head east on the road
in front of the Toad House.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Make haste to the east.

You must go to the
Koopa Bros. Fortress.

Go east on the road in front
of Toad House.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come again?
Strange Toads blocking the
east side of Toad Town?
That shouldn't be...

That's ridiculous!
Such a thing has never been
heard of! Never!

I'll get to the bottom of this.
Follow me over there.
I'll see what's going on.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are these the strange Toads
you were talking about?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I told you that you can't pass!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Take off!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmmm!
You aren't Toads, are you?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Um...we don't know what
you're talking about.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, what gives?
Ask anyone! We're just cute,
ordinary Toads hanging out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Reveal your true selves!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmph! Just as I thought.
You're the Koopa Bros.!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How... How'd you guess
it was us?
We were perfectly disguised!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shucks!
Black! Yellow! Green!
We retreat!! ...for now...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, those imposters were
none other than the Koopa Bros.

You must pursue them to
their hideout, the Koopa
Bros. Fortress.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario,
there's one part of your
fortune I haven't revealed.

To get to the Koopa Bros.
Fortress, you'll need help from
a blue-shelled Koopa.

This is a strange portent. In
Koopa Village, you might find
something that will clear it up.

I must return home now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To get to Koopa Bros.
Fortress, you first need to
find a blue-shelled Koopa.

My fortune-telling never lies,
Mario, so heed my words.
Trust me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah, Mario.
Do you want me to predict
the path you should take?

It will cost 5 coins.
Is that acceptable?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Excellent.
Now relax while I read
what your future holds.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooooo---------!
Crystal eye!
Open wide!

Aiiii----------!
Aiiii-----------cha!!
Ai, ai, ai------ching!!!

Ah haaaa!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You don't want me to
predict your future?
All right. Whenever you
lose your way, come to me.

If you require something other
than fortune-telling, stand
beside me to talk to me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

How tragic.
You do not have enough coins.

As my familial code states,
I can't predict your future
if you lack the funds.
I'm very sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you want me to predict
your future, talk to me
from across the table.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Merlon is here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's you, Mario.
What fortunate timing.

Hmm...? The town seems to be
pretty active today, but
it's none of my concern.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's you, Mario.
What fortunate timing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I had a dream last night, and
another oracle spoke to me.

Its voice was heavenly...

"If you keep going around
and around the red palm tree
in the distant desert town
-- Dry Dry Outpost --

something good will happen."
So said the voice in my dream.

It doesn't seem to make any
sense at all to me.

In fact, thinking about it
makes me so uneasy that I can't
sleep at night.

If you find out what it means, 
please tell me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm...

"Desert town, red palm tree,
go around and around,
something good will happen."

What does the dream mean?
I can't get it out of my mind.
I can't sleep. I can't eat.
I'm obsessed!

Anyway, if you want me to
predict your future, talk to
me from across the table.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...?

Oh, this Badge is Quick Change!

I had no idea such a useful
Badge was in my attic...

Mario,
you are a very lucky man.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You should put that Badge on.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You are Merlon, correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm? Who's it from?

Hmmmmm...
Oh, my granddaughter, Merlee!
She recently entered the
family business.

Umph... Is that so?
Oh, I see. Interesting...

She opened up her business
at Dry Dry Outpost, deep in
the desert.

It's located somewhere
quiet off the main drag.

She seems to be keeping busy.
That's good to hear.

Thanks so much for bringing
this letter.
I'll give you this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's you!
You came at such a good time.

There's a guest waiting
for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nice to meet you.
I come from Starborn Valley.

Starborn Valley is in the
Shiver region, a chill place
far to the north, at the very
end of the earth.

Merle, who hails from there,
said that he had something
important to tell you, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Merle of Starborn Valley is
my son, Mario.

It seems he's calling for you.

If he is searching for you,
you can be sure something
important is afoot.

You must go to Starborn Valley!
Do not delay!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, please hurry!

I will run ahead and take
tidings of you to Merle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think somewhere deep below
Toad Town is a pipe connected
to Shiver City.

Starborn Valley is located
quite near Shiver City.

Mario...
hurry to meet my son.
He waits in Starborn Valley.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
you must hurry and find my son
in Starborn Valley.

You must enter the tunnels
beneath Toad Town and find
the pipe that connects to
Shiver City.

Starborn Valley is near
Shiver City.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's dangerous out there.
I wouldn't go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, you shouldn't go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nope, no go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sorry, but no.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You don't wanna go out there.
It's way too dangerous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Going to Koopa Bros. Fortress
would be a huge mistake.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Definitely. Definitely don't go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Most of all, though, you shouldn't
go ask old man Merlon for help.

That would be really bad news
for us...I mean, for you!
Don't even think about it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, hello...
This is the post office.

You can read any letters that
arrive for you or for your
other party members.

Please drop by now and then
to check and see if you've
received any mail.

Well...

Oh! You seem to have some mail.
Which one would you like to read?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah yes, Mario.
Yes, hello.

Well...

It seems that you have
received some mail.
Which letter would you like
to read?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah yes, Mario.
Yes, hello.
Well...

It seems that there are no
new letters. Sorry.
We do still have all of your old
letters lying around...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whose letter would you like
to read?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh?
Shall I put the letters away?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Would you like to read more
letters?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...
You aren't going to read it?

Come on by anytime you want
to read some letters.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here you go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We'll keep the letters for you.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stop, thief!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Shy Guy just stole a bag
full of undelivered letters!

I'm sure there were tons of
important letters in that bag!
Bills, cards, packages... 
What are we going to do?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shy Guys stole a full bag
of mail from us.
We've failed in our duty...

"Come rain or sleet or snow
or Shy Guys..." We're supposed
to deliver no matter what!
Whatever can we do?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, that's it, that's it!

The bag! Thank you, Mario!
You'll never know how many
people will be happy to get mail.

Let me give you a small 
thank-you gift.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Was that the stolen mailbag?
Oh, I guess I'm mistaken.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Greetings.
The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

Water and dirt, sunshine power,
beautiful blooms,
beautiful flowers.

Hello! My name is Minh T.
Please enjoy the beauty
of this flower garden.

I've heard there's a lovely
flower we don't have here.
Supposedly, Bub-ulbs have
the only known seeds.

{Bub-ulb}
 This is what a Bub-ulb
 looks like.

If you find a Bub-ulb,
could you get seeds for me?

I'll plant them in this flower
garden and raise them lovingly.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! You'll give me this seed?
Thank you!
I really appreciate it.

I'll plant it right away.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These seeds relate to an
age-old story.

If you plant all four of the
different-colored Bub-ulb
flowers, a miracle will occur.

I wonder what will happen?
I can hardly wait for that
day to come!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You've got a seed for me?
Thank you! I'm really happy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If all four colors of Bub-ulb's
flowers bloom, this garden will
become magical.

I still need two more colors.
Please bring me the seeds
when you find them!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You brought me a seed?
Thanks! I'm so pleased!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Bub-ulb's flowers bloom,

Shy Guys are trampling all over
my flower garden!

Oh! The poor flowers...
They were so beautiful...

It was my dream to fill Toad
Town with beautiful flowers...

I'm so sad...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No-----!!!
Don't step on the flowers!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank you!

The flowers give you their
thanks as well, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kyaaaaaaaah!!♥♥♥

At first it just looked like
the flowers were blooming,
but suddenly a door appeared!

It must be... You must be able
to go to Flower Fields from here.

Mario,
Flower Fields needs your aid!
Please help!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can just imagine the drooping 
flowers in Flower Fields...

Mario,
Flower Fields needs your aid!
Please help!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can imagine all those flowers!
So colorful and happy, turning
their faces to the sun.

Mario,
you saved them! Flower power!
You're a true hero!♥

Bub-ulbs come from a
flower-filled land called
Flower Fields.

They say the flowers in
Flower Fields are in trouble!

To get to Flower Fields, you
need four kinds of seeds that
only Bub-ulbs possess.
But where are the Bub-ulbs?

Please, Mario,
you must look for Bub-ulbs
and get the seeds from them!

Maybe Merlon's fortune-telling
could help you look...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please, Mario,
we need seeds from the Bub-ulbs.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow!
You brought me the seed!
Thank you so much!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Flower Fields is in a state
of despair because of
Bowser's minions. 

Please!
Save us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Minh T., correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's work is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To me? Who's it from?
The Wise Wisterwood?
Who's Wise Wisterwood...?

"Thank you for making the
flowers bloom so beautifully"?
...Oh!
It's a thank-you note!♥

It says, "Please drop by
Flower Fields sometime."

Wow!
How delightful!♥

But how does Wise Wisterwood 
know about me...???

Oh, excuse me. I'm rambling.
This is a small gift to say
thank you for delivering the
letter. Please take it!♥

The building with the spinning
roof is Merlon's house.

He's weird. He also happens
to be as stubborn as a mule.
He rarely comes out.

As weird as he is, though,
his talent is no joke.
He can read the stars.

He even predicted that you'd
come back safe and sound!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Mario!

Merlon was looking for you.
He lives in that house with
the spinning roof.

He asked me to tell you to go
meet him at his house.

I was just about to go look
for you, but here you are!

It's rare for Merlon to call
somebody over to his house...

He's a bit eccentric.
Even when he has visitors,
it's rare for him to come out
of the house at all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Koopa Village is to the east
of Toad Town.

You know that famous explorer
by the name of Kolorado?
He has a house there.

He's probably not there now.
I heard that he's in the field
exploring Dry Dry Desert.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Some guy named Rowf started
a Badge Shop in the square
over there.

I haven't been, but it looks like
he's selling rare Badges.
You been there yet?

Have you been there recently?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shy... Shy Guy... Shy Guys
just stormed the...
post office...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I tried my best to catch that
Shy Guy when he bolted from
the post office, but he was
way too fast.

Maybe I need to work out more
on my "Toadinator."
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard you got back the
letters those Shy Guys stole
from the post office.

You're so smooth, Mario.
You always get the job done!

I asked Minh T. to make a
bouquet so I could give it
to my mother.

Minh T.'s the absolute best
at growing flowers.
She senses flowers' feelings.

My mother was so pleased
to get pretty flowers that
she made me a pie. Yum!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bub-ulbs can speak the same
language that we do.

They're pretty easy
to understand, I guess.

But I definitely don't get how
Minh T. communicates with
other flowers...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
Great timing.

Somebody was looking for you.
He's over at Merlon's house.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
do you collect Badges?

I've heard that there are
Badges for almost everything!

I bet adventuring is a whole
lot easier if you have lots
of Badges, huh?

Up on Shooting Star Summit,
there are these two siblings
named Merluvlee and Merlow.

Merluvlee tells fortunes.
She's really good at finding
Badges or Star Pieces.

When you take Star Pieces
to Merlow, he'll trade them
for Badges.

These two could help you, no?
You ought to go meet them.

If you want to go to
Koopa Village, head east
on the road in front of
the Toad House.

There's a fork in the road,
so watch the signs and be
careful not to get lost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you taking a trip to
Dry Dry Desert?
Take the train.
There's a station south of town.

After getting to the station
at Mt. Rugged, you'll have to
hike over the mountain.

Dry Dry Desert is just on the
other side of the mountain.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard there are old ruins
somewhere in Dry Dry Desert.

Some team of researchers is
looking for them, excavating
in the sand. Must be hot.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you met the wise Toad?

He lives over by the
western gate. The big one.
That guy seems to know
something about everything.

He's really popular at parties,
what with his knowledge and
everything. You'd be surprised.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you see that?
Shy Guys just went into the
post office!

Wha... What should we do?!
You think they're causing
trouble in there?

Maybe they can still be
stopped...if we act quickly.

Mario!
Can you go check in there?
I'd go, but I have a bum leg...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shy Guys stole the mailbag
from the post office!

It all happened so fast that
I didn't have time to react!
They were gone in an instant!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You got the letters back!

Mario, you rock!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have this friend who really
loves to fish.

Every time I go to the port,
there he is, fishing.

Ever met him?

Do you see that blue pole
in front of the post office?
That's a road sign.

You can find out what's where
in Toad Town by checking out
the signs.

What am I telling you this for?
I'm sure you know it's smart
to read all the signs you see.

How about going to the post
office from time to time?

The mail doesn't stop
just because you're out
gallivanting around.

Everybody in your party might
get letters...
Isn't getting mail the greatest?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shy Guys can be so aggravating!
Grr!

They think stealing people's
stuff is funny! It's not!
People are really upset!!

If we don't do something,
they'll make off with all
the valuables in town!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now Shy Guys stole a mailbag
from the post office. A mailbag!
What's the world coming to?

What could they possibly want
with a mailbag?

Think about how many important
things travel through the mail!
Those Shy Guys have really
done it this time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Heyyyy... You got that stolen
mailbag back, didn't you?

I heard. Way to go!
The mail is safe once again!

The postmaster must be feeling
deep relief right about now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody was just saying 
there's a monster at the port.

I could almost believe it.
Lots of weird stuff's been
going on since Peach was taken.

I wonder where Her Highness 
is now?

I hope she's OK...
I worry about her constantly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that the monster at
the port was really a whale.

Big surprise. Everyone's so
on edge, though, that it was
easy to believe at first.

If people just kept their heads,
we wouldn't have all this panic.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach...

Oh..., If only I could see her
smile once again...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach...

Oh..., If only I could see her

return to us soon.

And all because of you.
You...sniffle...work so hard...

Mario...
...you're the greatest, man!
Only you can save her, so get
up there and do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Mario!
Word is you're needed on
Shooting Star Summit.

You never been? Just go through
that blue gate there and
bear right at Peach's Castle.

...Oops! I forgot...
Peach's Castle is... gone......
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I thought I knew everybody in
this town, but I've never seen
those dark Toads before.

Seen 'em? Over by the
Toad House? They look nasty.
I hope they don't pick a fight.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those dark Toads were actually
the Koopa Bros.! "Nash T."...
I should have known!

Those no-good scheming...
Dressing up as Toads to cause
trouble is just plain rude.

I'm lodging a formal complaint!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, by the way, if you were
to go across Dry Dry Desert,
you'd reach Dry Dry Outpost.

It's a small town. But they do
have a shop and a Toad House.

Never been there, myself.
I'd like to, but that heat...

He's crazy about Star Pieces.
Trades Badges for 'em.

Hey, hold up! Shy Guys just
ran into the post office!

You know that isn't good.

Mario, check it out, will you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, drag, some mail was stolen?

Maybe we should've warned you
earlier about the Shy Guys...

They've always been a problem.
I guess I just tuned 'em out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hold up, now! You got back all
that stolen mail?!

Oh, yeah! Way to go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm keeping my eyes open for

Shy Guy front.
They won't catch me off guard.

You're gonna take him on.

That monster's pretty huge!

Of course, maybe you're afraid
but are going anyway...
That's even more courageous!

the flowers...
She's as pretty as a rose.

there's a lot of cleaning up
to do. Is this my chance?

I... Maybe I should go help
Minh T. fix the garden...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, Mario! I'm bursting!

I helped Minh T. fix up
the flower garden!

She thanked me! And smiled!
I've never been so happy!♥

OK... I should calm down!
I shouldn't get so worked up
when everyone in town is having
such a hard time.

it comes to growing flowers.

Flowers grow more lovely in
her lovely hands.
Their blooms... Their petals...

Oh,...
how beautiful... Minh T. is!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've always been content just
to watch Minh T. at work.

...At least, that's how I
used to feel, but lately I've
grown restless...

What good is looking at her?
If I never get up the nerve
to talk to her, she'll never
know my true feelings...

Oh... Minh T....
Maybe I could talk to her up
on Shooting Star Summit.

The theft of our castle caused
great destruction here.

The worst of it happened
in the center of town.
It seemed to rain wood.

As a result, we can't get to
the southern part of town.

The train station, the port...
many important things lie south.

Not being able to get there is
a great inconvenience to me
and to everyone.

now we can. Excellent.

We can once again reach the
port and the train station.

The trains are up and running
again, but I'm told they were
stuck for a while because of
a large boulder.

Local opinion holds that you
broke it for us, Mario.
Thank you. I'm ecstatic.

The Toad who guards the
entrance to Forever Forest 
is a timid lad named Fice T.

Word is that Fice T. had
grown tired of being timid,
so he requested and got the
job of guard of the forest.

Still... His fear remains.
He is terrified of ghosts, 
and looks not into the forest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario. Bad things are afoot.
Shy Guys just ran to the west,
toward the Main Gate. They're
no doubt up to something.

There is a shop over that way.
Perhaps it is there that they
have set their sights.
No good can come of this.

I witnessed a Shy Guy fleeing
with a book of some sort.

I ran and ran, but he was too
fleet of foot.

He headed south, toward the
house of Tayce T. I must
recover from this excitement.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario.
If the Shy Guys aren't stopped,
I may have to raise my voice.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The town has grown peaceful
once more. The Shy Guy menace
is at last halted.

We owe you a debt.

Those Shy Guys...
I'm not usually this emotional.
I must calm down.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario. Calm my nerves.
Princess Peach will return
safely to us, is it not so?
She must, or I may faint.

This town was once peaceful
and carefree. My wish is to
see it peaceful once more.

Shiver City is far from here,
in the northern lands.
There is snow there always.

If I ever had to live in such
a place, I'd never go outside.

The people up there should
wish for warmer weather.
Maybe it's none of my business.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have a wish... A simple wish
that Toad Town would return
to its peaceful ways.

Perhaps this time it is you,
and not the Stars, that will
grant my earnest wish.

I am filled with excitement.
Go forth. And good luck.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Mario!
It's me, Twink.
Remember me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard you saved the honorable
Star Spirit who was captured
by the Koopa Bros.!

Bowser and his gang are so
angry about it!

I knew you could do it, Mario!
You're on your way!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But enough celebration for now.
I come bearing important
information for you.

It seems that one of the Star
Spirits is being held captive
somewhere in Dry Dry Desert.

Bowser wrote it in his diary.
Some place called Dry Dry Ruins.

The princess braved the dangers
of the castle to get you this
clue, Mario!

If we find out anything else,
I'll hurry back to tell you.

I have to go back to Her
Highness now. She's so brave!
I hope this news helps!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What-ho, old boy! Ahead is
Pleasant Path, but...Kent C.
Koopa is blocking it.

It appears he's quite strong.
I say, a strong brute indeed!
This is a bit of a sticky wicket!

There's naught I can do...
The only course of action is
for me to search for a secret
passage to Koopa Village.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Kolorado, correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good gracious!
A letter from the missus!

But when did she send this?

Well, in any event,
cheers for delivering it.
Take this, old boy.

I came upon it during my
incredibly important research
on Lavalava Island.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Dry Dry Ruins dig grew
tiresome for me. I left it
in the hands of my assistants.

I say...?

Mario, that artifact of yours...

That looks like... The subtle
craftsmanship...indeed!
It's a clue to Dry Dry Ruins!

A careful study of this by my
learned eyes could well solve
the mystery of the ruins!

Mario! Old boy! Be a chum!
Could you part with it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I'm a grown Koopa here, 
begging you on my knees
for your generosity.

I must have that artifact!
I can't stop thinking of it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, dear...
Won't you change your mind?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, bother!
I suppose nothing I can say
will sway you.
I guess I'll just suffer...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Cheers, Mario!
Smashing, really, old boy!

I'm refilled with vim and vigor!
Soon now, the mystery of
Dry Dry Ruins will rise from
the sands that conceal it!

As a brilliant archaeologist,
I say it must be so!

Hm, yes, of course, well.
I suppose a thank-you gift
is in order, eh, old boy?
Here you go then!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll start examining this
the moment I get home.

Yes, well, here's to you,
old chap. Safe travels!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh my goodness, it's Mario!
My name is Tayce T.
I looooove to cook!♥

If you bring me ingredients,
I'd be happy to fix you one
of my energy-giving dishes!♥

Would you like me to cook
you something?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's Mario! Hi there!
Would you like me to cook
you something?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, honey?
Would you like me to cook
you something?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh my.
You don't have any ingredients
for me.

I can't cook without ingredients,
silly!
Bring some next time!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, that's too bad.
I was so excited to show you my
cooking skills. You don't know
what you're missing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Which ingredient would
you like me to use?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You don't want me to cook?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Would you like me to use
another ingredient?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's the matter, honey?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the same kind as the
first ingredient.
Please choose a different
ingredient, all right, hon?♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Then I shall cook with
{x}.♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Then I shall cook with
{x} and {x}.♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh my.
You don't want me to cook now?
Well, come back soon, hon!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I'll whip something special
up just for you, honey.
It'll be fabulous!
Just a moment!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tra-la-la-la-la!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All done!
It smells delicious!♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, sweet success!
This dish is one of my
specialties!♥♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here you are!♥
This recipe's not too bad.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... I'm so sorry.
This recipe didn't work out.
Oh well! Tee hee!♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, all finished!
...I don't exactly know what
it is, but sometimes experiments
turn out to be great!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Here, please!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come back anytime, hon.
I look forward to it!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... NO!
My favorite Frying Pan!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...hello there, hon.

Thank you for coming to visit,
but I'm afraid I can't cook now.
I'm so sorry.

My dear old Frying Pan was
stolen by a Shy Guy.
It really burns me up...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But...you aren't going to give me
back my Frying Pan?

Mario, how could you...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
My dear, dear Frying Pan!♥

You saved it from the Shy Guys!
Thank you so much, Mario!♥

For that, I'm going to make you
something extra-special!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's the Cake!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is my most delicious Cake.

One taste of it won my late
darling's heart...♥

I swore I would never make it
again, but you're very special,
Mario.♥

Just one bite will make
anybody go ga-ga!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, my...
You're carrying too much.
You can't possibly take this
Cake with you right now.

Come back when you have
fewer things, OK, hon?♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, my! Oh, good heavens!!
That book you have!
It looks like a Cookbook!♥

I could increase my repertoire
in an instant with that book.

Mario,
if it's okay with you...
may I have it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hello, hon.
You know, I still wouldn't mind
having that Cookbook...

I could increase my repertoire
in an instant with that book.

Mario,
if it's okay with you...
may I have it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...OK.
Why'd I get my hopes up...?

It's your book, after all.
You can do what you want.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh! I can have it?♥
Oh, how delightful!♥♥♥

With this Cookbook, I can
use two kinds of ingredients
at once and make even more
fabulous dishes for you!

Please bring me different
ingredients so I can try out
some new recipes!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Beyond here lies dark and
gloomy Forever Forest.
You'll get lost for sure,
so I'd advise you not to enter.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aaaaaaaagh!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brrrrrrrr...
Juh...Just now, a ghost passed
right in front of me...

Uhhh...You saw it, didn't you?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I...I'm not the only one!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

No...You must have!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Over there----!!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No, no, the other way---!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It went into the forest!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario,
this madness has to end.
Will you go into the forest
and see what's going on?

I'm ashamed to say it's my job,
but I just can't go.
I'm too frightened of ghosts!

Puh... Please, I'm begging you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Forever Forest is dangerous.
Children are strictly prohibited.
There are...ghosts...in there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario, behind you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!

G... Gho...... Ghost------!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shy Guys have been raising
a ruckus all over town.

But compared to ghosts,
Shy Guys are nothing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario, behind you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!

G...... Gho...... Ghost------!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ever since I was a child,
I've been easily frightened.

My wish, above all else,
is to become a brave Toad.

That's why I took this job
as guard of Forever Forest.
I must not be afraid!

Only by facing our greatest
fears can we grow courageous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario, behind you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!

G...... Gho...... Ghost------!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've been thinking about
courage recently. I don't think
fearing nothing is courage.

In fact, standing up to a thing
you're scared of is what true
bravery is all about, right?

I've run from my last ghost!
I am the brave Fice T.!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario, behind you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!

G...... Gho...... Ghost------!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I got really into reading
scary novels recently.
They're good, but...

I wish I could forget some
of the things in those books!
When I think of them, I get
scared just standing here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario, behind you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!

G...... Gho...... Ghost------!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I hear that you're
finally going to take on Bowser!

You're so brave.
I wish I could find courage
as deep as yours...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario, behind you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!

G...... Gho...... Ghost------!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Fice T., the guard of
Forever Forest, correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's work is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder who "Bootler" is.
...

Ugh... Oh, no...
No--------!!

This is from that ghost!
It says, "I'll creep up on you
while you're sleeping... Boo!"

He loves scaring me!

You think...he'll really...?
Creeping...darkness...
Oh, woe is me! I'll never sleep...

Get a hold of yourself, Fice T.!
Stand tall! Fear not!
I'll be OK. Here, take this.

These building materials used
to be stacked by the road,
but they all came down when
that earthquake hit.

Unfortunately, it's impossible
to go to the south side of town
with all this scattered wood.

Don't worry. We're restacking
it as quickly as possible.

I know it's inconvenient,
but please bear with us while
we get everything in order.

Toad Town Station is just
south of here.

The train there is the only
way to reach Dry Dry Desert.

You aren't thinking of going
to the desert, are you, Mario?
Be careful if you do...

People around here think that
there's a huge ghost mansion
deep within Forever Forest.
Full of Boos, people say.

And get this: according to
the rumors, there's even a cute
princess-like ghost in there!

People will say anything!
How would they know if this
ghost princess was cute?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yow! A big group of Shy Guys
just ran off to the north!

There's all sorts of trouble
they could get into up there...
At the post office...the shop...

Look, Mario, would you mind
going to check out the scene?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So! The post office was robbed
after all. Just as I expected!

Ooh... Those rabble-rousers!
There's a limit to how much
mischief we'll put up with!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario, good work getting
that mailbag back.

I'm sure glad you're on
our team, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aaaah... Nothing like a day
without hordes of galloping
Shy Guys running about!

Thanks for dealing with those
mischief-makers, Mario.

Doesn't something smell good?

Tayce T. lives in this house.
She's an incredibly good cook.

She just taught me the recipe
for delicious Fried Shroom.
You make it with a Mushroom.

Someday, if I keep practicing,
maybe I'll become a master chef.

Tayce T. just taught me how
to make Spicy Soup! Hot stuff!

Have you ever tried it?
A fresh Fire Flower is the
key to a good Spicy Soup.

I just made it at home, but it
nearly fried my taste buds off!
Tayce T.'s is much yummier.

I've got to keep practicing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you hear? Tayce T.'s best
Frying Pan was stolen!

It was the work of Shy Guys!
I'm a huge fan of Tayce T.'s.
It really gets me steamed that
they'd do such a thing!

Please, Mario! Try to get her
Frying Pan back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh... Oh, my! Smells like
Tayce T.'s baking a Cake!
What a tantalizing aroma!

The Cakes Tayce T. makes
are beyond belief.
I'd love to make one sometime.

But you need Cake Mix to
make a Cake, and it's really
hard to find.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Maybe you know, Mario.
People say that somewhere
in the world is an ultimate
Cookbook for master chefs.

Supposedly, if you believe
the rumors, it has recipes
for unheard-of delicacies.

Tayce T.'s been looking for
that book for quite a while,
but she hasn't found it.

I don't know how you'd find it,
but if you do, give it to her.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard Tayce T. increased
her repertoire of recipes!
I wish I had her skills!

Of course, even she doesn't
always know how a dish will
turn out.

When she uses a Mystery?
ingredient, it's anybody's
guess as to what will appear.

Sometimes the result is good.
And sometimes not...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How many times has Bowser
kidnapped Peach, anyway?
It seems like every time you
turn around, he's done it again!

Maybe Bowser just wants to eat
the cakes the princess bakes.

Yeah, that must be it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My wish was to become a good
cook and to work as a chef
at Princess Peach's Castle...

Right now it doesn't look
very likely...but I believe
the castle will return one day,
and everything will be fine.

So I'm going to keep on
practicing cooking!
You have to chase your dreams!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I tried to make Maple Super
the other day, but it didn't
go well at all.

To make Maple Super, you need
Maple Syrup and...
Well, let's see... What was it?

It's really a delicious dessert.
I want to make it for my love!

I guess I'll have to remember
the recipe exactly.

Either that or just guess...
I'm not going to give up!
I'm going to keep trying!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was just trying to bake
a batch of Kooky Cookies.
I'm going to give them to the
object of my affection.

One ingredient is Cake Mix.
And the other is...
You find out!♥

I'm going to bewitch my love
with these cookies.
He'll fall head over heels!

Because I've been practicing,
I'm well on my way to becoming

I heard that Princess Peach
is a good cook, too.
I hope the princess will be
back soon.

Of course she will!
You're saving her, right?
Then it's settled. The princess
will definitely return soon.

I'll be supporting you.
Good luck!

Have you ever met Merluvlee
of Shooting Star Summit?

That lady... She's so lovely...
and mysterious...
Oh, I'm crazy for her!♥

I heard that her hobby is
cultivating bonsai trees.
Maybe I should try that, too...

By the way, did you know that
Merluvlee has a twin sister?
Her sister must be really
gorgeous and charming, too.

She lives in a house just
over there.

She always cooks great dishes
for the townspeople.

I heard that when Tayce T.
used to live in the Dojo,
a powerful Goomba teacher was
training The Master.

Tayce T. learned to cook from
the Goomba teacher's wife.

What? You don't know why
Tayce T. lived in the Dojo?

The Master and Tayce T. are
brother and sister.
Everybody knows that!

Have you ever met the wise
Toad, Russ T.?

He has more books than you
could shake a shroom at!

People say that some books
are very old and rare.

I also heard that Kolorado,
that explorer, sometimes uses
those books to do research.

But, I heard that Kolorado
doesn't treat the books with
care, and Russ T. is secretly
pretty mad about it.

Have you ever met the
postmaster?

I just had lunch with him at
the restaurant at the port.

He told me that the postman
who just started working for
them is always making mistakes.
He said he's pretty worried.

But do you know what?
He didn't look worried.
He was smiling when he said it!

He must be happy that he's
finally found a successor to
take over his job.
Maybe he can retire soon.

when I grow up, but..

I decided not to 'cause...
I decided I wanna be a hero
like you instead.

I'm going to beat up the bad
guys, then I'm going to save
Princess Peach.
Is it hard to do?

Let's get 'em!

...Oh! Mario!
Sorry, I was just practicing
beating up pretend Shy Guys.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now I've decided to become
a ship captain.

Because trains have to stay
on the tracks, y'know.

You can go anywhere on the sea!
Ahoy! Full steam ahead!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hi, Mario. Do you know...
what do archaeologists do?

I heard they travel around the
world and look for treasures.

Doesn't that sound like fun?
Maybe I want to become an
archaeologist now.

Will the Stars make my wish
come true, you think?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
I'm thinking of becoming a
detective when I grow up.

There's this really cool detective
in this novel my mom's reading
right now.

I wanna be like him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hi, Mario.
Y'know, I've thought I wanted
to be a lot of different things
when I grow up.

But I decided that I'm just
gonna be myself.

Although maybe I'll imitate you
a little, if that's OK...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dry Dry Desert is huge.

Wherever you go, all you can
see is sand. Many a wanderer
has gotten lost, so travelers
should use extreme caution.

Oh, and you should avoid
any whirlwinds you see.

According to my sources,
if you get close to a whirlwind,
it'll blow you far away.
Chances are, you'll get lost.

I just saw an odd thing:
a gray Boo with a mustache.

He seemed to be looking for
someone. He was wandering
all around here.

According to my sources,
there's a Boo Mansion deep
within Forever Forest.
Perhaps he came from there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The recent invasion by these
Shy Guys has everyone reeling.
There's no end to their mischief.

I just saw Shy Guys run over
toward the station.
What could they be up to now?

Unless I miss my guess,
it's bound to be something bad.
Wouldn't you agree?

You may be the only one with
the strength to repel them.

According to my sources,
Shy Guys come from the west.

It looks like it's up to you
to find their hideout and
teach them a lesson.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, the Shy Guys are gone.

Strangely enough, I feel kind
of lonely when it's so quiet.

Minh T. was looking for you
in the flower garden, Mario.

Reports are sketchy, but I've
heard that a flower-filled place
called Flower Fields is in
a world of trouble.

Mario,
you'd better go talk to Minh T.!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
According to my sources, a door
leading to Flower Fields has
appeared in Minh T.'s garden.

I suppose Bowser's not content
just spreading trouble in our
fair kingdom.
He's moved on to other worlds!

Mario,
is there nothing to be done?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My sources tell me that deep
inside that pipe over there,
lie many hidden treasures.

What kind of treasures?
Inquiring Toads want to know!

I have a hunch that very
soon now, Princess Peach will
come back to us.

The castle and our friends
will all come back safely and
everything will be just like it
used to be...

I never ignore a hunch.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
People say that there's a big,
dangerous creature living deep
inside that pipe over there.

But when people tell you not
to go in, it kind of makes you
want to even more!

Of course, you'll be all right
if you carry lots of items.

Probably...

When you get lost in Forever
Forest, you find yourself back
at the beginning in an instant.

I guess that's why they say
it's almost impossible to find
your way through there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems like all the Shy Guys
come from just west of here.

I wish we could find out where
they come from and get rid
of them! Rapscallions!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sick of these Shy Guys
stirring up so much trouble.
Can you beat them up? Please?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are lots of rumors about
that pipe over there. One is
that huge monsters live there.

Another one claims that the
pipe somehow connects to many
distant towns.

They're only rumors, though.
Who knows if they're true?

Mario, you're really good at

You roll up like paper

That's so cool!

P...
Pppppppppppppppppppp...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
PUFFFFF!
Well, hello there.

My name is Bub-ulb.
I came from Flower Fields,
the wonderful land of flowers.

I'd love to spread the wondrous
flowers of Flower Fields all
over your land!

You like flowers, don't you?
Of course you do. Who doesn't?
For that reason I'll entrust
this to your care.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That is a flower seed.
If it's well cared for,
a beautiful flower will bloom.

These flowers are delicate...
Only one with a loving heart
can make them bloom in beauty.

Please take good care of it,
for beauty is fragile.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Most flowers don't speak, but
they all listen.

When you grow flowers, be sure
to speak kindly to them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a beautiful day, today.
The sunshine is pouring down
on us from the sky...
It feels ever so nice.

Now that I think about it,
yesterday and the day before
were also fine...

Is it just my imagination,
or does the weather never
change in this town?
Nah, I must be imagining things.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Either there's not enough sun, 
the people here are too loud, or
it's boring because the place is
too quiet.

You may not know this,
but it's natural for some
flowers to complain all the
time or flip-flop on issues.

Who's to say that's wrong?
There's a saying:
"The soil is always browner
on the other side."
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
At times, I feel homesick for
my home, lovely Flower Fields.

Back there, there are beautiful
and unique flowers as far as
the eye can see.

You really should journey there
someday to enrich yourself.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The wonderful flowers of
Flower Fields are grown in
rich earth with pure spring
water and warm sunshine.

There are so many of them
that when they all talk at once,
it gets rather loud.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard you beat up the evil
Huff N. Puff, who had brought
darkness to Flower Fields.

Thanks for saving my hometown,
from the bottom of my roots.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The people in the town say
that you are going to save a
person called Princess Peach.

I don't even know who she is,
but best of luck anyway.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Mario!
Good to see you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We found out that you defeated
Tubba Blubba!

I knew you could do it!
I just knew it!

When we heard the news, the
princess was very relieved.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yes...
I've got new information about
the honorable Star Spirits
who are still imprisoned.

Have you ever heard of
Shy Guy's Toy Box?

It seems that one of the
honorable Star Spirits is
being held there.

...But
where on earth is Shy Guy's
Toy Box? I have no idea...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Oh, time is short! I have to
go back to the princess now.

Good luck, Mario!

Princess Peach and I are
always cheering you on.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm ruined... Done for!
A huge rock is blocking
the train tracks!

When Peach's Castle was
uprooted, one of the boulders
from that stack rolled off and
landed here. What bad luck!

If we can't do something
about that boulder, I can't
make my run to Mt. Rugged!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank you, Mario!!
The train's back on track!

All aboard!!
This train is bound for
Mt. Rugged.

Are you coming, Mario?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Howdy, Mario.
This train is bound for
Mt. Rugged.

Are you getting on?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

The train is about to depart.
Please board quickly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

We hope to see you again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Toad Town!
Toad Town!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's still some time before
the next departure.
Come back in a bit.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What'll I do... I'm ruined!
There's no hope for me!

We can't get the train moving
because of the pesky Shy Guy on
the tracks.

I told him to scram,
but he won't listen to me,
and he won't move at all.

What am I gonna do?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank you, Mario!!
We're rolling now!

All aboard!!
Are you coming along?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Sit tight, folks.
Now departing for Mt. Rugged.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I love trains, don't you?
I love to come here and watch
it come and go, but it doesn't
seem to move at all now.

It's really a lot more fun to
watch when it's moving.
The problem must be that
gigantic rock on the tracks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're the best, Mario!
It's nice to see the train
up and running once again.

It really wasn't a whole lot of
fun watching it just sit there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I overheard someone saying that
there's been a Boo sighting
at the edge of Forever Forest.

Boos never come to Toad Town.
Most unusual...

By the way, Mario,
did you know that this here
blue pole is a road sign?

There are signs all over
Toad Town, so check them well.

Road signs could even lead you
to Forever Forest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
(No need to translate)
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Shy Guy on the tracks
has stopped the train schedule
again.

This is no good.
Can you scare him off?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The sound of the wheels when
the train is running...
Psshhh! The loud hissing...
And the WHOOO-WHOOOOOOO!

Just listening to trains
makes me feel at peace.

I want the train to keep on
running today, tomorrow, the
next day...
That's my wish, all right.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I guess it's sort of odd that
this train only goes between
Toad Town and Mt. Rugged.

Maybe they ought to expand
to some other areas.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I like watching the train from
here rather than actually
getting on it.

If I get on it, I won't be able
to see the train.

watch the smoke puffing.

I wish that someday, in a far-
away land, I'll find someone who
loves trains as much as I do.

So! I hear you're off to
fight Bowser.

Princess Peach and everyone
in the castle will finally
come back, won't they?

Mario...
when peace returns here, I want
to tell you something, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
you do keep a good supply
of items on hand, don't you?

If you get attacked when you
have nothing, you'll be in a
pretty tight fix, huh?

My advice is, whenever you're
going on a long journey,
you should stop by a shop and
load up with supplies.

That's just great.
The train can't move because
a Shy Guy is on the track.

Say, Mario...
Any chance you could do
something about that guy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, thanks, Mario!
The train's back in business!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Say, Mario,
you do always carry items
when you travel, don't you?

Don't be overconfident.
You never know when you might
get caught off guard.

there may not be a shop around.

You should always be prepared

Ever been to Dry Dry Desert?
It's a really scary place.

I've seen packs of cactus
monsters, thieves who prey on
travelers' coins, and even
whirlwinds!

It's a lot safer to stick to
the path so you don't get lost.
It goes in a direct line from
Mt. Rugged to Dry Dry Outpost.

Playing on the train tracks?
How dumb are these Shy Guys?
What a nuisance...

I mean, Shy Guys are known
for being aggravating,
but this is ridiculous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shy Guys always play pranks,
but they never seemed so wicked
before this.

You don't think that Bowser
could have something to do
with this, do you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A lot of people claim that
hidden treasure is spread
all over Dry Dry Desert.

If you get to know the area
pretty well, it might not be
a bad idea to check around
a bit and try to find some.

As for me, I'm too scared of
getting lost out in that heat.
I just stick to the path and
go right to Dry Dry Outpost.

all the time if the desert
weren't so dangerous.

You can do it!
Here we go, Mari-o, woo woo!

What up, Mario?
Like slides? The slides on
Mt. Rugged are the coolest!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

that launch you way out!
I wanna go there again!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, let's go beat him up!

...No, maybe he's too tough.

Hey! Hey! Mario!
How about you go beat him up
instead of us?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yippee!
See you later, Shy Guy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're so tough, Mario!!

I'm going to get stronger 'til
I can beat up Shy Guys, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know what? There are 
whirlwinds in the desert.

They swallow you up, then
spit you out somewhere else.
I know 'cause I heard it's true.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah! Whirlwinds always happen
in the same places, too.

My friend says that where you
end up depends on where you
meet up with the whirlwind.

Nature's a mystery, huh?

a whirlwind on purpose?

My pal says there's a guy 
in Shiver City who writes 
really interesting mysteries.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I guess mysteries are all right,
but I think that funny and
exciting stories are better.

I'd rather read a story about

That'd be the best!

You're Dane T., correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks, Mister!

Wow! I mean, wow!
It's an invitation to the 
haunted mansion!

I didn't think it would really
come...

All the kids in Toad Town
have been talking about this
invitation, wondering if it was
for real.

But... now that it's come,
I guess I have to go...
Mini T., are you brave enough
to go with me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uhhhh... You know, I'm really
kind of busy and...
Oh! Yeah! 
I just had the greatest idea!

Let's ask that Yoshi Kid from 
Yoshi's Village to come.

You just got a letter from that
kid last week, didn't you?
You know! That letter you got
from the island?

Let's send a letter back to him
and tell him about the scary
adventure we're gonna have.

Hey! Mr. Postman!
Take this letter to the red
Yoshi Kid in Yoshi's Village!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Dane T., correct?

The name's Parakarry.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! Thanks a lot!

You're much faster than the
old postman, that's for sure.
That Yoshi Kid is a really
good pen pal, huh?

He writes really long letters.
It sounds like there's always
something fun going on over
where he is. Lucky Yoshi...

We should write back again.
Hmmmm... What do you think
we ought to write about?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmmm... I don't know.
Let's think about it later.

By the way, I wanna ask you
for a favor, Mr. Parakarry.
Can you deliver this?

It's a letter for Uncle Frost T.
of Starborn Valley.

He's my uncle.
He's up there taking care
of lots of Star Kids.

It sounds like a hard job.
He has to chase 'em around
all the time.

At least that's what he says
in the letters he sends.
Anyway, I wrote him a letter
to take his mind off work.

I know it's far from here,
but I'd really appreciate it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I love Li'l-Oinks!
Love 'em! You... You want
to learn about 'em?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha... Li'l-Oinks are so cute!
Aren't they the most adorable
things you've ever seen?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, OK... If you want to hear 
about the different types of
Li'l Oinks, just ask, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Li'l-Oinks are timid and 
mysterious creatures that 
hatch from eggs.

They spook easily, and will
run away if you approach them.
Observe them from out here.

There are many breeds of 
Li'l-Oinks. They're very easy
to tell apart.

White ones, black ones...
even gold and silver ones!

If you're curious about the
breed of a newborn Li'l-Oink,
come over to talk to me.

I wish the world were full
of Li'l-Oinks!
That would be grand!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, wow!
It's a Silver Li'l-Oink!

Look at its silver hide!
Glittering in the sunshine...
What a gorgeous creature!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoopee!!
It's a Gold Li'l-Oink!

Look at its golden hide!
It glows like a treasure
of ancient times!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a Black Li'l-Oink!
They're known to be wild!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a White Li'l-Oink!
So pale and dainty!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a Pink Li'l-Oink!
Such coloring!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a Tiger Li'l-Oink!
Look at those stripes!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a Shroom Li'l-Oink!
They're the cutest!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a Flower Li'l-Oink!
Nice floral design!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a Star Li'l-Oink!
The stars...so mystical!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's a Question Mark
Li'l-Oink!
How weird... Uh, I mean
how int... interesting.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We can't work because 
Peach's Castle flew away.
Oh, well! I guess there's
nothing to be done!

The girls and I always wanted
to go on a long trip.
How lucky for us!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
At first, I said let's not go
because there's so much trouble
going on.
But...

Eventually I came around!♥
We're ready to roll! But now
the train can't move. Great. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Our first stop was going to 
be the desert town.
I wish we could go! Right now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're finally departing.
On the train, girls!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you girls have all your bags
and everything?
I hope I didn't forget anything.
I bet I did, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Okay, okay. Let's go to 
Mt. Rugged! Except...

Let me just check my bags
one more time real quick.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you!
Thief!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario. It's you.
A Shy Guy stole my Storeroom
Key!

I can't stay in business if I
can't get into my storeroom!

What in the world will I do?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why, Mario!
Is... Isn't that...
my Storeroom Key?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, Mario!
You did it! You got back my
Storeroom Key!

Thank you so much!
You saved my livelihood!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ahem... Uh, Mario?
Please don't open the storeroom
without my permission, all right?

Huh?!
Hey! You got back my
Storeroom Key!

Oh, thank you, thank you!
You saved my business!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tell you what. Take anything you
like from the storeroom.

It's just a little thank-you for
getting my Storeroom Key back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi! I'm new to the neighborhood.
I never expected it to be so nice
and quiet in the big city.

It cost me a small fortune in
coins to get this place, but I
think it was worth it.

It's such a lovely house, isn't it?
It sure is!

Thanks for coming to visit me!

It's so quiet around here. I've
been really bored...

I know I just moved here, but I
kind of wish I'd moved somewhere
more...happening.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi, Mario! Hey, by the way...
Did you know the house next door
is supposed to be vacant?

...But you know what? I hear lots
of noises coming from there. 

Maybe it's a thief's hideout...
Oh, how scary! Right next door!

What!? You're kidding me!
Shy Guys are living in the vacant
house right next to us?!

I would never have bought this
house if I had known...
I'm calling my realtor!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those Shy Guys really seem to
have quieted down recently.

Too quiet... I get really lonely
when it's so dull.

I wish those Shy Guys weren't so
bad. I bet we could be really
good friends if they shaped up.

My wish was to live a peaceful,

quiet house.

But recently, I've been feeling
very blue inside.

My wish may have come true, but
the princess was kidnapped and
all...

It's tough to feel happy when
everyone around you seems to be
suffering.

Hey, Mario. Are you good at
saving up your coins?

I still have tons of coins in my
savings. I have no idea how to
spend them all!

You don't know of any smart
investments, do you?

Hi, Mario! Are you ready?
I heard you're off to take on
the evil Bowser!

If you can beat him, I'm going to
spend all my coins on one huge
celebration.

Just to show how much you mean
to this town, I'm going to fill the
sky with booms and pops and
bangs and zings! All for you!

I won't tell you more...
It'll ruin the surprise!
Hee hee hee hee...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you're Mario, right?
We just moved in! We've only just
unpacked!

It's like a dream come true. A
quiet and gorgeous home all to
ourselves!♥
Ah, I'm so happy!

Of course, happy as I am, I know
these are sad times. I try not
to act too jolly when I'm out and
about.

It's actually kind of unsettling.

I miss all the hustle and bustle
that was here when we first
moved in.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody's really been raising a
racket in the house next door,
that's for sure!

It sounds like a bunch of kids
bouncing off the walls.

And I thought that house was
vacant...
How creepy!

You mean Shy Guys were staying

No wonder it was so noisy...
I knew something was weird.
Empty houses don't make noise.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Toad Town's back to being quiet
now that the Shy Guys are gone.

Yup... Reeeeal quiet. Nothing
going on at all.
Ugh... I need some excitement.

I can kinda understand why the
Shy Guys were running wild. This
town is sort of stifling.

When we first moved in here,
Toad Town was hopping! Now it's

Even when I wish to the Stars,
my wishes don't come true any-

getting me down.

By the by, Mario,
if you can't hold any more items,
you should leave them at the
shop.

You can pick the items up again
at any shop in the world, so it's
a useful system.

Eek! Mario!
Some Shy Guys just ran into the
shop over there!

There's no way they're gonna do
anything good in there!
Get 'em! Please!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I tried to chase the Shy Guys,
but I fell and lost their trail.

I was real busy holding my toe
and shrieking, but I think maybe
they went to the port.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you get tired, you really
ought to rest at a Toad House.
A good nap is the best medicine.

Maybe you should hit the Save
Block after you rest, too. Just
to be safe.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you're going to travel far,
you really should get healthy at
a Toad House first. 

Oh, and you should stop by a
shop and get some items.

And brush your teeth.
Maybe comb your mustache.
Don't forget to save, too.

Hey there, Mario!
Did you recently go some place
tropical or something?

You look like you came back with
a little tan.
I didn't think you could possibly
look any cooler, but you do.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
aren't you tired at all?

Adventuring must take its toll.

Try to relax while you're here in
Toad Town, OK?

The Stars used to make wishes
come true for the citizens of
Mushroom Kingdom.

Supposedly, they only grant good
wishes, but who's to say which
wishes are good?

great big hidden ruin somewhere
in Dry Dry Desert, but

I've heard a rumor that Shy
Guys are hiding in somebody's
house in Toad Town. Here! Shy
Guys in Toad Town!?

What rubbish!

I think that people would notice
a huge group of Shy Guys living
in one of the houses in the
neighborhood.

There's no way that's true.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...?
Mario, you're trying to go to 
Lavalava Island?

Good luck. You're completely
wasting your time, though.

Lavalava Island only exists in
rumors spread by idiots.
It's a figment of imagination.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're going to Lavalava Island
on a whale?!

Mario, there's no such island!
And furthermore, there's no way
you can ride a whale.

I'm shocked that you would make
up such lies, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You went to Lavalava Island?
Yoshis? Ravens? Erupting
volcanoes?

Wow, that's amazing!

...You know something, Mario?
It's also a big, fat lie!
I don't believe it for a second!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've heard a rumor that the door
in the flower garden leads to a
region that's full of flowers.
It's called Flower Fields.

Oh, come on. No more of this.
Another world? Unbelievable. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A lot of people around here say 
that there's something inside
that pipe in the town, but...

I don't believe one word of it!

It was about you going to fight

Well, for one thing, it's scary.
You could get hurt, you know.

I can't believe a sane man would
willingly do such a thing.
I won't believe it! No! I don't

I'll never believe you! Neveeeer!

She doesn't play much anymore.

named Herringway.

Mom says it's a real page-

children. I tried to sneak a

This neighborhood is the

Shy Guys just went into that
empty house right there.

Do you suppose... Could that be

Our pleasant local shopkeeper
has been hit by Shy Guys! They
stole his Storeroom Key.

Oh, this is simply awful! How will
he ever get it back?

Our local scholar, Russ T., has
met with an ill fate. It seems
that Shy Guys have made off
with his beloved dictionary.

My heart aches for that poor
man. He loved that dictionary
like a son!

Dearest Mario, is there any
chance you can retrieve it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My dear Mario,
what an odd note you have!

Others say it's a monster.

there for some time.

was a whale?

Oh, silly me! I shouldn't have

hiding around here?

Unless I miss my guess, they
must be in a house. Dig me?

Hey, Mario.
About Rowf's Badge Shop...

I've heard it said that there
are lots of Badges there.
Might be a good idea to go there
often, you dig me?

Do you know postman Parakarry?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He delivers letters to many
towns in the Mushroom Kingdom.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But he's easily distracted, so
more often than not, the mail
runs a little slow.

The guard of Forever Forest is
really chicken. He's especially
afraid of ghosts.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I know, I know. He's a riot.
Sometimes even I scare him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That guy will run for the hills if
he ever sees a real ghost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My keen intuition tells me that
Shy Guys must be hiding in a
house somewhere.

What do you guys think about
finding their hideout and taking
them on ourselves?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, there's a plan! But have
you ever seen those guys run?
They're way too fast. If they
see us, they'll bolt.

...Wait! I know!
Why don't we turn invisible?

If we do, the Shy Guys will be
off guard and reveal themselves
to us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh... One problem, guys. How do
we become invisible?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Y'know, it's great having pals
like you around.

When you've got friends, you've
got people who can lend a hand
with stuff you can't manage.

There's no obstacle too great
when you're with friends!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, man. You're the greatest!
Stop getting all mushy on us!
You're making me bashful.

And you know, it's really
important to know what kind of
unique abilities your friends
have.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What in the world does that have
to do with being bashful?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's that, Mario? You want to
go to Lavalava Island?

Yeah, Lavalava Island...
I'm pretty sure that's an island
way south of here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There aren't any ships that go 
there from Toad Town...

You'd better have strong arms,
'cause you'll have to swim there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's impossible.
If there's a person who can swim
there, I'll eat a Fuzzy.

You know, guys. There's a girl I
kind of have a crush on.

But I'm terrible at expressing
my feelings. Know what I mean?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Really, I never knew!
Way to go, man! Just lemme know
if you need any advice. I'm the
master!

To start with, you can never go
wrong with flowers.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah right, flowers! Flowers!
Girls love getting flowers like
nobody's business!

Mario, you're really rolling on
this adventure of yours, aren't
you? Kickin' Koopa!

We read all about it on the town
bulletin board.
You make headlines all the time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But... Well...

Are you gonna save the princess
soon or what?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, that's not cool!
Don't be rude to the man!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Even when you're out of town,
Luigi is still around, so we feel
safe.

With two local heroes, we have
nothing to worry about.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I noticed that Luigi looked a
little down in the mouth, though,
since you've been out.

You should go visit him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sure I know what his problem
is. He probably just wants to go
on adventures, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
Good luck, big guy!

I know you can beat Bowser!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're behind you 100 percent,
Mario, old pal!

With you on the job, Peach is as
good as saved!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We all believe in you, my man!

Good luck!
Give it up for Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yo, little man.
Name's Chet Rippo.
Pleasure meeting you.

Say, man, don't you want to
upgrade your status?
Heh heh... Yeah, I know you do.

It's usually 390 coins, but for
you and only you, I'll do it for
just 39 coins.

If you gimme 39 coins, I'll
upgrade your HP, FP or BP.

I'm not lying or cheating you.
Come on... You know you want it.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yo, little man.
It's your old friend, Chet Rippo.
Good to see you again.

Usually this costs 390 coins, but
for you and only you, I'll do it
for just 39 coins.

If you gimme 39 coins, I'll
upgrade your HP, FP, or BP.

Trust ol' Chet Rippo... Come on!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Too bad... Your loss.
Another time, maybe.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

What are you trying to pull?
You don't have 39 coins!

Too bad for you...
Try coming back when you have a
few coins in your pocket.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

There you go! Good call!

Here's your current status.
Maximum HP is "{#},"
FP is "{#}," and BP is "{#}."

Choose the one you want to
upgrade.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Aw, man. You're backing out...?
Oh, well. Your loss.
See ya.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

All right.
So you want {x} to 
be upgraded.
Here goes!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, now your {x} 
have been upgraded.

Oh, yeah... Another status might
have dropped a bit, but I can't
do anything about that.

Heh heh... See ya!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, now your {x} 
has been upgraded.

Oh, yeah... Another status might
have dropped a bit, but I can't
do anything about that.

Oh, and the Badges you had on
are now off. So don't forget to
put them back on.

See ya later.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, too bad, man.
That one can't be upgraded any
more.

It's a bummer, but there's
nothing you can do.
See ya.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! It's Mario!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well. If it isn't Mario!
How wonderful to see you!

I came to go shopping today.
It was a long walk to get here
from Goomba Village...

but it was worth it to see you!
I was hoping to see Goombario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario, you're looking just
fine, aren't you?
You be careful not to be a
burden on Mario's adventure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! No way I'm a burden!

I help out all the time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well!
Our dear little Goombario is
helping out the great Mario!

I'm so proud!♥
I'm going to tell Dad and
Goompa!

Mario, you must come over to our
house again someday!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come on, stop it, Mom!
You're embarrassing me.

I'm not a kid anymore.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, don't be silly, punkin!
I'm not saying anything 
embarrassing at all.

I just love you, that's all.
Can't a mother be proud of her
children?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, Mommmmm...
You always treat me like a kid.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyeah, nyeah!
Goombario's getting scolded!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shut up, Goombaria!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waaah! Mom!
Goombario's being mean!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario. Good luck and take
care of yourself.

Don't forget to visit us.

The whole family worries about
you, so you should be sure to
stop by our home every once in
a while.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!♥
Nice to see you again!

How's my brother doing?
I really worry about him. After
all, I'm his sister.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...♥
Please take good care of my
brother, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come on, we're in a hurry, 
Goombaria! Seriously!
You're so obnoxious sometimes.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Be quiet!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bye, Mario! Good luck!
Take care, Goombario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew!
Ahhh, fresh air!

After being cooped up in there
for so long, I could really use
some outdoor exercise.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My name is Muskular.
Mario,
I must thank you for saving me.

Now it's my turn to help you.

Behold!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Call on me whenever you find
yourself in trouble.

I'll always come quickly to aid
you in battle.

Now...
I'm going back to my dear old
Star Haven...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Mario!
I have news...
News from the castle...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gasp!
Honorable Star Spirit!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi!

Hmmmmmmmmmm...

I believe you are...
Twink, no?

You're that youngster who
recently ascended from
Starborn Valley up to Star
Haven.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!?
You remember my name?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha ha ha! Why, of course!
We're like family!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I... I...
I'm so touched!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ho ho ho!
Don't make such a fuss, lad.
I'm sure you'll go on to do great
things!

I must take my leave now.
Good-bye!
Twink, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow!
I talked with Muskular, the
honorable Star Spirit!

I rarely have such a chance,
even at Star Haven.
I'm shaking!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oops, I'm sorry!
I have some important news
from the castle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
According to the information 
Princess Peach and I got...

It seems that one of the
honorable Star Spirits is being
held at Mt. Lavalava on
Lavalava Island.

You wouldn't believe what the
princess went through to get
this information.

I hope it will be of help...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm going back to rejoin
Princess Peach now.

Mario, as always, good luck.

The princess and I will keep
looking for useful information.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yep. We lost a whole mess of
glasses around here when the
earthquake hit.
Been cleaning ever since.

It's a shame. Lots of fond
memories in those glasses.

Ever since Bowser skedaddled
with the castle, we haven't
had near as many customers.

Well, people try their best
to act like everything's
still normal, but deep down
they're all real worried.

Who can have a good time
partying when they're sad?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good thing for us none of those
Shy Guys come here.
'Course, neither do customers.

Most likely folks don't feel up
to a night on the town in such
troubling times.

I tell you, I'm tired of polishing
glasses no one uses.

Word is, something strange is
floating at the port.

Well, that's even more bad news.
Now people just have another
reason to stay away from here.
What a fine how-do-you-do!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A whale? You don't say?
A whale right off the dock!?

Well, that's sure a relief.
Pretty peculiar, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tell you what, son. That whale
turned out to be a blessing.

It's an attraction, if you catch
my drift. People are finally
starting to come back here for
entertainment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those dark days when we had no
customers seem far off.
That whale really gave us a shot
in the arm!

I'll tell ya, I'm happiest when
I can work hard and spread a
little joy around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I may not be one of those
mystical Stars, but I know
people's wishes, all right.

Seems like every customer I
have bends my ear a while.

I've been hearing people's
wishes ever since I first opened
this place up.

Welcome to Club 64!

How do you like the club, dude?

fixed up in no time.

People need a reason to grin!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no way! For real?
A whale, huh?

I thought it was some kinda

like that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

It's huuuuge! Huuuge, dude!

Oh, Mario, Mario.
Don't push yourself so hard.

Relax and just go at your own
pace, like the sea does.
Good luck turning the tide!

When I behold the ocean,
I feel peace and serenity.

When you feel sick in body or

And on a whale, no less!
It sounds like a dream...

Living a peaceful life on an
island with no rules and no
schedules to keep...
Oh! How I envy you, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey Mario,
the woman who tends flowers,
Minh T., is looking for you.

Lavalava Island...

Hello, Mario.
I heard that you went over to
Koopa Village recently.

A long time ago, I went to Koopa
Village, too.

I remember it like it was just
yesterday. There were all sorts
of people...uh, that is Koopa
Troopas, there.

One Koopa loved the radio,
I recall...those four rowdy
brothers...that giant Kent C....

Oh yes, there was also that
world-renowned explorer and
archaeologist, Kolorado.

If I recall correctly, his wife
was always worrying about him.
I suppose she wanted him to
stay home a bit more.

I often wonder how all those
Koopas are holding up...

Hello, Mario.
I heard you hiked over to
Dry Dry Desert recently.

A long time ago, I went to
Dry Dry Desert, too.

Sadly, I got lost in the desert.
A noble soul by the name of
Moustafa saved me.

The way the locals referred
to him, I assumed at first that
he was a fierce, stern person.

But once I spoke with him, it
became clear to me that he was
quite a nice guy.

A secret surrounded this
Moustafa...
I was let in on it.

Moustafa is actually...
No, I can't tell you!

Well, Mario,
because it's a secret.
That's that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, Mario.
I heard you braved Forever
Forest recently.

I got lost in Forever Forest
a long time ago.

I wandered around and around
in circles for a good while,
utterly lost, then at last I
came to a mysterious mansion.

It was there I met a Boo by
the name of Bootler.

This Bootler used to travel
the world having adventures
with a pair of his friends,
a Goomba and a Koopa Troopa.

We spoke of many things,
he and I. He even told me
of his undying love for the
mistress of the mansion.

There was a little girl Boo
there then, the granddaughter
of the mansion's mistress.

She was headstrong and very
spoiled. Still, she was cute.

I wonder how she's doing now.
She must be beautiful.

Hello, Mario.
I heard you braved Forever
Forest recently.

I got lost in Forever Forest
a long time ago.

I wandered around and around
in circles for a good while,
utterly lost, then at last I
came to a mysterious mansion.

It was there I met a Boo by
the name of Bootler.

This Bootler used to travel
the world having adventures
with a pair of his friends,
a Goomba and a Koopa Troopa. 

We spoke of many things,
he and I. He even told me
of his undying love for the
mistress of the mansion.

There was a little girl Boo
there then, the granddaughter
of the mansion's mistress.

She was headstrong and very
spoiled. Still, she was cute.

I wonder how she's doing now.
She must be beautiful.

Hello, Mario.
Do you happen to know the owner
of the Badge Shop that recently
opened? Rowf?

I met that Rowf in a different
town a long, long time ago.

Back then, he was selling rare
foods, not Badges.

I recall that he had a beautiful
wife at the time.

They worked so hard together to
build a business up from nothing
in that town.

His wife doesn't seem to be here
in Toad Town, though.
I wonder what happened...

Hey, Mario,
I heard you went over the sea
to Lavalava Island recently.

I went to Lavalava Island a
long time ago, too.

The folks in Yoshi's Village took
really good care of me.

What a wonderful place it was!
Such a mild climate, and some
of the tastiest foods!

I remember eating picnic lunches
on the beach, sea breezes...  
It was just fantastic.

Oh, it's been too long!
I must go again sometime.

Hello, Mario.
I heard you went over to
Flower Fields recently.

I've never been there myself,
but the elder at Koopa Village,
the esteemed Koopa Koot,

told me once about the time he
journeyed to Flower Fields
in the days of his youth.

According to his tale, he
valiantly saved a big tree
called Wise Wisterwood.

Old Koopa Koot...
He's told me a million stories
about his travels.

He was a famous explorer when
he was younger, probably the
most famous Koopa in the land.

Perhaps it was Koopa Koot's
influence that led Kolorado
into the adventuring life.

Hello, Mario.
In all your travels, have you
ever been to Star Haven?

As far as I know, nobody has
ever been there. It's too far
off, way beyond the clouds.

If I could have one wish, it
would be to open a Toad House
in Star Haven.

Don't you think it would be
amazing to live with the stars
surrounding you?

You could stay for free,
of course, whenever you came.

Heyyy... Do you see something
floating over there?

See what I'm talking about?
Well, if you go straight and
walk onto the pier, you'll be
able to see it.

It bothers me for some reason.
I think I just saw it move!

That thing that looks like an
island has been floating in the
port for days.

But just recently, it moved
right next to the pier.

Brr... I wonder if one day soon
it'll come ashore...

Ma... Mario,
could you possibly go see if it's
dangerous?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh? Oh!
It was only a whale, after all.
Who'd be scared of a whale?

M... Me?
I... I don't remember that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where'd you go on the whale?
Lavalava Island?

Sweet!
Of course, I've heard of it,

It makes me want to write a

Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!

Everyone's got the fishin' bug!

Ye should come along, Mario.

Yar, that reminds me...

Yar, and take good care, fer

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmm...hi. I'm Chanterelle. 
I'm known around here as the
Pop Diva of Toad Town.

Oh, I used to be able to sing
any song perfectly, each note
a masterpiece.

Those times are behind me
now...perhaps forever.

The sight of Peach's Castle
flying high into the sky was
such a shock...I haven't
been able to sing since then.

And now... Now I am a Pop Diva
who cannot sing...
Cruel irony, isn't it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now I am a Pop Diva who cannot
sing...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My sweet voice! I long to sing!
Please help me, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My sweet voice! I long to sing!
Please help me, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thanks to you, I have found
my voice once more!

Please let me sing to express my
deepest thanks!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
May I sing for you?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
♪♪♪
OK. Perhaps another time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You've made me so happy!♥
Let me begin...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm Simon. I'm rhymin'. To folks
who know it, I'm the Master Poet.
Poor Pop Diva cannot sing, but
my Lyrics are just the thing.

If my Lyrics really rock, our
Pop Diva will be cured of shock.

I'm tragically stuck, though.
'cause my last line's a no-show.
Later, plumbinator!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...
That final "right" line just
jumped into my mind!

Sit tight...O plumbing knight.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The race is won, now I'm done!
I'm not really one to boast,
but talent? I've got the most.
Now to my Lyrics, raise a toast!

Cha-ching!
Pop Diva now will sing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... But...
I'm afraid I just can't sing
without any Music.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
!? Ooooh! Drat and drear!
My mind wasn't clear!

Lyrics aren't the only thing
Pop Diva needs again to sing.
Without Music, it's quite clear,
the Diva's voice, none will hear.

Hmmm, what shall I do...
...what shall I do...

Who can pair my Lyrics and
Music, too?
...I know who!!

I heard a rumor that somewhere
is a Composer beyond compare.

Special power his Music brings.
Can it help the Diva sing?

Mario, I'm on my knees!
Won't you help, pretty please?
Here, take this and go!
Find the Music, save our show!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
That's the Music!
Please do show!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please! It's time to sing.
Come on, now, don't be so mean!
You don't want to cause a
scene!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... Hmmm...
Oh yes, yes, yes! It's the best!!

With this Music, we rejoice, for
it will give Pop Diva voice!

Now, Chanterelle.
Please do tell.
Will you sing this new song?
Come now, we can't wait long!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!
It's perfect! So beautiful!

... But...
What if I can't sing it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, hey, it'll be OK.
You can do it. Nothing to it.
Be courageous! Sing it loud!
Warble on, sweet and proud!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... Yes...
I will try to sing.

Aaaaa aaaaaaaa
OK...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bravo! Hear, hear!
This sweet song has brought me
tears!

To Mario, our greatest thanks!
Because of you, Pop Diva
cranks!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can sing! Laaa-diiiii!
I'm overjoyed!

Thank you!
You saved me, Mario!

I wish I could do more...
but here's a small gift.
Please treasure it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmmmm...
Chanterelle's voice is even more
sweet and tender than before.

Her trials of these past days
most likely helped her, in a way.

Why, my dear chap, I am none
other than Kolorado, famed
adventurer and archaeologist.
I'm touring the world!

And you're Mario, yes?
What are you doing here?

Well, I for one am traveling
bravely to Lavalava Island in
the southern sea to solve a
diabolical mystery.

It would seem that there are
ancient treasures waiting in
a volcanic cave.

I'm in a bit of a fix, though.
No way to get there, you see.

Hmmm...
Think now, Kolorado! How to
cross the sea...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, good show!
It's a letter from my wife.

Thank you ever so, old chap.
This is just what I needed to
give me strength for the trip.

...I know!
I'll pass this along as my most
sincere thanks.

I came across it while I was
researching my latest project
in Dry Dry Desert.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Dry Dry Ruins dig grew
tiresome for me. I left it in
the hands of my assistants.

I say...?

Mario,
That artifact of yours...

That looks like... The subtle
craftsmanship...indeed!
It's a clue to Dry Dry Ruins!

A careful study of this by an
experienced archaeologist like
me could well solve the mystery
of the ruins!

Mario! Old boy! Be a chum!
Could you part with it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sadly, the excavation at
Dry Dry Ruins is not all
it could be...

I was reluctantly forced to
leave it to my assistants.


Mario, old boy!

I beg you to reconsider and give
me that artifact!

Dear man, have mercy!
It is absolutely vital to my
important research!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...old chum...

I must have that artifact!
I can't stop thinking of it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh dear...
Won't you change your mind?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, bother!
I suppose nothing I can say will
sway you. How tragic.
How very sad.

I guess I'll just suffer...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Cheers, Mario!
Smashing, really, old boy!

Soon now, the mystery of
Dry Dry Ruins will rise from
the sands that conceal it!

As a brilliant archaeologist,
I say it must be so!

Hmm, yes, of course, well. I
suppose a thank-you gift is in
order, eh, old boy?
Here you go then!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I found it in Dry Dry Desert.
I have no use for it.

Now then! Let's get down to
brass tacks, eh? Let's solve
this mystery in front of us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch! Yeeowch!
What are you doing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, good heavens!
I was wondering what this was.
It seems to be a huge tuna!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooooog...
I'm not a tuna. I'm a whale.

...And I have problems!
It feels like something's jumping
around in my belly!

Ow ow ow... Help me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm... I say...
Old boy, this great tuna seems
to have a bit of a bellyache.

Mario, what say you lend the fish
a hand, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh...
I told you I'm not a tuna...
I'm not even a fish...

And I have a headache from your
jumping around on me, too! Do
you think you could check my
belly?

I'm begging you, please...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now, now, you really should help
out, dear boy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Me...? In there? Poppycock!

My grandmother's last words,
and I quote, were: "Do not go
inside a giant tuna."

I wouldn't hesitate, of course,
being a fearless explorer,
but dear boy, one simply can't
ignore one's grandmother.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...something bouncing around in
my stomach...I feel queasy...
Please help me....
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you see what's going on in my
stomach? What is it?

Do something--fast!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw! My tongue!
What are you doing!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch! That hurt!
What are you doing!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waaaah!
Who dat!!

What d'you think you're doin'
with that light?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, fella!
You wanna piece o' this?

You got it!
I'm ornery as all get out!
Prepare for some pain!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Awwwww...

Shucks!
First I think I get away from
that ol' fishin' man...

and then I get all swallowed up
by some huge fish...
and then this fella with the
mustache goes upside my head.

I've just been fallin' outta
fryin' pans into fires since
I was just a grub. Talk about
a lousy lot in life.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, it's me!
You know, the whale?
Can you hear me?

That stomachache seems to have
cleared right up!

I feel fantastic!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whooooosh!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, it's you, boy!
You're that dumb ol' fish that
ate me all up and such!

You plumb idiot!
You know, I thought I was a
goner for sure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm awfully sorry.
I was just having a nap with my
mouth open.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well,
I suppose I can see my way to
forgivin' you this time, but
you just watch it.

Er... I reckon I owe you some
thanks, after all, Mr. Mustache.
Y'all take care, now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whew!
I feel so much better now!
They should call you Dr. Mario!

There must be some way I can
express my gratitude!

I've got it!
I, the tuna, am... I mean...
I, the whale, am quite good at
swimming.

To express my thanks, I'll take
you anywhere you want to go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pardon the eavesdropping, but
did you just say "anywhere"?

Mario! You old tuna tamer!
Accompany me to the shores of
Lavalava Island!

What a trip it'll be!
The island will be wonderful!
You must trust my instincts!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey Mario,
didn't Twink say one of the Star
Spirits was on Lavalava Island?

This is just what we needed.
Let's hop on this whale and go!

But this Kolorado character...

He'll probably be really
disappointed if we don't take
him along with us. I think the
whale can carry us all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,

I think Twink said one of the
Star Spirits was being held on
Lavalava Island.

This is quite timely.
We'd better get on the whale.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well now, Mario,

wasn't Lavalava Island the
place where one of the Star
Spirits was being held?

You remember what Twink said,
don't you? I do, anyway.

This is our chance.
Let's get on the whale.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!

I just remembered what Twink
said. He said one of the Star
Spirits was being held on
Lavalava Island...

This could be our chance.
We'll get there on this whale.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,

I believe Twink said one of the
Star Spirits was being held on
Lavalava Island.

Perfect timing.
Let's ride the whale.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, um...

I think the Star Kid said a Star
Spirit was...um, caught on the
big Lavalava Island.

We...um, we should go.
Big whale give us a ride. Whee!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh? Lavalava Island?
Yes, of course I know where it
is, but...

There's a big volcano on the
island and it's on the verge of
erupting. Very dangerous.
Do you still want to go?

Well... OK, then. It's your call.
Just let me know when you're
ready to go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, old boy, you must
remember to take me to Lava-
lava Island with you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ulp. Sure this is safe, then?
Make some room, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK!
We're off to Lavalava Island!
The sea is calling!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can't believe we're on a tuna.
Mario,
do you ever think about how
strange life can be? I do.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you want to go to
Lavalava Island?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Just come speak to me when you
want to go, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank heavens we've arrived!
Now, tuna-ferrying is one
experience I shan't do again.

Cheers for the ride, though!
I'm in your debt.

For now, I'm heading back to
Koopa Village to relax.
My wife must be waiting for me.

Perhaps our paths will cross
again in the future, old boy!
Cheerio!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Woooooooooooooooooooh!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wheeze wheeze wheeze...

I...will never...swim again...
for the rest...of...my life!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now, Mario!
You're mine this time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ayaaaaaaaaah!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wheeze wheeze wheeze...

Here it comes!
You... you'd better be ready!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gasp! Oh, no!!
All that swimming! My HP is
almost gone!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, I'll make up for my low HP
by using my new skills!

Check this out!
More power!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I know all of your fighting
patterns now, Mario.

See my gear?
The spike, the wings... You
can't attack me now!
I'm the smartest fighter alive!

I can't be defeated! Wa ha ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yow! What in the...?
I didn't think you'd do that!
Is that even legal?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aaaaaaaaaaaugh---
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you know what?
Now that I think about it...

I have wings... If I had just
flown to the island, I wouldn't
have wasted my HP.

Then I probably would have
beaten Mario in no time!

Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Sigh.........
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aargh!
No more time!

Too bad!!
Please try again next time.

See you at the next trading
event, all right?
So long!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello!
I'm the Toad from the trading
event. How are you?
Did you bring the item?

No?
You don't have anything?

Look, I can't trade with you
unless you bring the item I
told you to bring.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello!
I'm the Toad from the trading
event. How are you?
Did you bring the item?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Congratulations!

This is the item for today!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Use it wisely!

See you again at the next 
trading event!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wrong! Sorry.
That's not the right item.

As a penalty, I'm afraid I'll
have to take this item away.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello?
You don't want the item?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
BLOOPER!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well. Looky here.
Hello, hello, hello!
Rip Cheato at your service.

You're quite an enterprising
fellow, finding this place.

What am I doing here?
Just doing a little business...
and minding my own.

You, my friend, have just
stumbled into great fortune,
for I have a deal for you.

I have something special, and
it costs only 64 coins. Deal?
Trust me... It's a bargain.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My good sir,
you can't do without this one.

It's worlds better than the
last one, but for you, the
price is the same: 64 coins.

I, the eminent Rip Cheato,
will sleep better knowing
you've bought it, for you are
a man of great taste.

How about it?
Do we have a deal or not?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah ha...
So you cannot resist the
temptation of my goods!
I knew you would return!

If you miss this chance, you'll
never again find this item at
such a low, low price.

Right now--just for you--I'll
let it go for a mere 64 coins.
Do we have a deal or not?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well done, my good man!
I thank you deeply.

Now, if you thought that item
was good...

I have something even better
at the same price: 64 coins.

But I warn you, this offer's
only good right now.
You'll be kicking yourself if
you miss this opportunity!

So how about it?
Do we have a deal or not?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Okay...pinch your pennies.
It's a shame, really.
This item's so amazing...

And, well...it could be gone
when you come back...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, this is no good...
I'm afraid I can't sell anything
on credit.

Try coming back when you have
enough coins.

You'd better hurry, though!
Items as good as this one
don't stay around forever!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, this is unfortunate...
You have too much stuff!

Try coming back after selling
or checking some of your items
in a shop.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

He'd blame it on everyone but

Hey, are you having a good time
here at the Playroom, Mario?

I heard the 9-Blocks Option in 
Jump Attack is really hard to
clear successfully.

Maybe I'll have better odds
playing the 5-Blocks Option.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario! So you come here,
too. Having a good time?

Smash Attack is pretty hard.

I've never cleared it before.
Have you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm winning big, baby!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrr... I was so close today!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I won a little today.
Good luck, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh. Double ugh.
Talk about rotten luck...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Greetings, my good man!
This is the floor for Jump
Attack.

Gimme a second, and I'll explain
the rules for you.

Eleven blocks will appear in
the air. When you hit one, a
panel will come out of it.

There are four kinds of panels.
The number of coins you get
depends on the order you hit
the panels in.

{1-Coin Panel}
 This is a 1-Coin Panel.
 It will give you 1 coin.

{5-Coin Panel}
 This is a 5-Coin Panel.
 It will give you 5 coins.

{5-Times Panel}
 This is a 5-Times Panel.
 Your coins will be multiplied
 5 times.

 If you find this panel,
 unfortunately, it's
 Game Over.

If you clear the 9-Blocks
Option, as a special bonus,
your coins will be doubled.

The rules are written on that
board over there.

I think you'll catch on quickly
once you start playing.
Anyway, you might as well try
it at least once.

You need ten coins to play.
How about it? Wanna try?

I can't believe that Princess
Peach's Castle was here just a 
little while ago. Wow!

I was in the castle when it 
started to shake, but my 
lightning-quick feet got me out.

I know Luigi made it out along
with maybe a few others...

But everyone else was taken.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You don't know how happy I am
that you made it, Mario!

If you weren't in the mix, I
don't know what kind of chance
we'd have.

I'm rooting for you, Mario!
You've got to save the princess
and everyone else!

How depressing... Nothing but a
big hole where there was once a
beautiful castle.
The garden... Ruined.

Why do I torture myself by
coming here all the time?
I just can't help it.

Now no one walks here...

Sometimes I feel confident that

and that these days will seem
like a dark dream.

Pure fantasy, perhaps.
But that doesn't stop me from
wishing from the bottom of my
heart that it'll happen someday.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I beg of you, Mario!
Save all those poor captives
in the castle!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Muss T., correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly received.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's from Mr. Goompapa.
That old codger!
We think alike, he and I.

It's been ages since I saw him.
Too long, indeed!

This reminds me... I was just
thinking about sending a letter
to one of my other friends.

Your timing is perfect.
This letter is to my friend.

His name is Koover, and he lives
in Koopa Village. I'd like you
to deliver this to him.

I'll bet he's near the entrance
to the village.

He usually hangs out in front
of the Toad House that's right
on the edge of town.

No big rush, but it would be
nice if he got it soon.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome Mario...
We've been waiting for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're the 7 Star Spirits.

Our job is to grant the wishes
of good people from our home
in Star Haven, a place high
beyond the sky.

We're going to tell you something
incredibly important.
Please listen carefully.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The other day,

Bowser and his followers invaded
our peaceful Star Haven.

They stole our prized treasure,
the Star Rod, which we've cared
for since the beginning of time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Star Rod...
...is powerful beyond belief.
It can grant any wish.

For as long as we can remember,
Bowser has been making wishes
like, for instance...

"I'd like to trounce Mario" or
"I want Princess Peach to like
me."

Of course, Stars ignore such
selfish wishes.

As a result, his wishes were
never granted.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bowser...that fiend...

When he found out that we were
ignoring his wishes, he came and
stole the Star Rod so he could
grant his own wishes.

He seems content right now,
mainly because he defeated you
and captured the princess.

Soon enough, though, I fear he
will wish for more...and then
terrible things will happen.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It is the responsibility of the
7 Star Spirits to keep the Star
Rod safe and use it properly.

We must get the Star Rod back
from Bowser and return it to
its rightful place!

In order to do this, Mario,
we need your help!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sadly...

...right now you are not strong
enough to challenge Bowser...

...he has made himself all-
powerful by making wishes with
the Star Rod.
He is terrible to behold!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Once we 7 Star Spirits are
reunited in Star Haven,

we can give you the power to
fight Bowser even with his
newfound strength.
With our help, you can prevail!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...we are...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Alas...
We've nearly exhausted our
power to talk to you.

Although it looks like we're
there beside you, it is only an
illusion.

We're using all of our strength
to communicate with you over a
great distance. But even now,
our strength is fading...

We've been caught and are being
held by Bowser's followers in
different places throughout the
Mushroom Kingdom.

Please, Mario,
first of all, you must rescue us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In order to take the Star Rod
back from Bowser...
and save Princess Peach...

we need your help...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please, Mario...

you are our last hope...
and we will...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
It looks like things are a lot
more serious than I thought...

Do you think the princess is
going to be all right?
I'm really worried about her.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, sorry, sorry, so sorry!
I'm in a huge hurry!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...it's...!?
You're Mario, aren't you!?

Thank the Stars I found you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How do you do?
I'm Twink.
Princess Peach asked me to
bring something to you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ahhh... Yes, here it is!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Here, this is it!
Take it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's the "Lucky Star" from
Princess Peach.

Now that it's yours, you can use
the "action command."

May I take a moment to explain
what the action command is?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

This is important, Mario.
I think you'll want to know about
this.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh! OK! Great!
I don't even have to explain.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK.
Let me explain.

Let me see...

Hang on. You! Behind Mario!
Would you mind helping me
demonstrate something?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Me?
The name's Goombario.
Of course I'll help!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, Mario and Goombario.
Let's begin!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
First, Mario,

choose the Jump command and
then decide which enemy you
want to attack.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Once you decide on the enemy,
the explanation of the action
command will appear.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Right now!
Just before stomping the enemy.

Press {A} at exactly this moment.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Press {A} at exactly this moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When you see "Nice" appear,
it means you've successfully
used the action command!

When you do, you'll increase
the amount of damage you do.
OK, now this time, Goombario,
you try to attack Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK!
Here it comes, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Right now!

Press {A} just before the attack
strikes you.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! You successfully used the
action command.
This will reduce the amount of
damage you receive.

Often you'll have to use 
different techniques to make
use of the action command.
It depends on the attack.

Try attacking by Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Often you'll have to use

Try attacking by Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Once you choose an enemy to
attack, move the Control Stick
to the left.

OK. Move the Control Stick.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Move the Control Stick to the
left and keep it there.
Don't let it go.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
☆ flashes as soon as your power
reaches its maximum.
That's when you let go!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right! You successfully used
the action command!

Well, Mario,
do you understand the ins and
outs of the action command?

Let's practice a bit to make
sure you've mastered how to use
it properly.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, Mario,
do you understand the ins and
outs of the action command?

Let's practice a bit to make
sure you've mastered how to use
it properly.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You don't need to practice
anymore...?
That's our Mario!
You're a quick learner.

Well, I guess that's about all I
can teach you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The action command will serve
you well, so practice it.

If you're done with this training
session, choose the End Training
command.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well done, Mario!!
You successfully used the
action command.
You have great timing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Almost!!
That was a little bit too early.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Almost!!
That was a little bit too late.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, I guess that's about all I
can teach you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Once you understand how to use
the action command properly,
you'll be even more powerful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Terrific!
You'll be much tougher in battle
now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here you are!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!? It can't be...
Were you following me!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a foolish Star Kid!!

I knew that if I followed you,
I'd find Mario!

If I defeat Mario right now,
I'll be famous!

I'll tell Kammy Koopa!
She'll shower me with praise!
She'll give me a raise!

Here I come!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well done, Mario!
You're as strong as they say.

I know that you'll be able to
defeat Bowser!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm going to return to Princess
Peach's side.

I'm not strong enough to really
help her, but at least I can tell
her you're OK.

Well, Mario...
...see you later!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh dear!
I almost forgot to tell you the
message from Princess Peach.

"I'm all right, so don't worry
about me..."
...that's exactly what she said.

I get the feeling, though... 
...that she's very lonely.

Anyway, I'll do my best to help
the both of you!

But please be brave!
You must save Princess Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There he goes...
back to Bowser's Castle.
What a brave little guy...

OK, Mario,
let's get down to business!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... My, my...♥
I foresaw your arrival, Mario.

My name is Merluvlee.
I'm a stunning fortune-teller.

My noble calling is to read
fortunes while looking absolutely
ravishing. I can help you find
what you seek.

My twinkle star here will show
me all that's hidden.
My, my...♥

Tell me...
Shall I read your fortune?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... My, my...♥
We meet again, Mario!

My noble calling is to read
fortunes while looking absolutely
ravishing. I can help you find
what you seek.

Tell me...
Shall I read your fortune?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... My, my...♥

Shall I read something else?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It appears you have found all
that I can show you.

Don't be a stranger.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

My, my...♥ Are you sure?
If ever you seek something,
please call upon me again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

My, my...♥
How unfortunate!
You don't have enough coins.

Alas, I can't read your fortune.
Please call upon me again once
you've saved up some coins.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Star Piece, is it?
My, my...♥ OK♥
I'll now read your fortune with
grace and unrivaled good looks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Badge, is it?
My, my...♥ OK♥
I'll now read your fortune with
grace and unrivaled good looks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Super Block, is it?
My, my...♥ OK♥
I'll now read your fortune with
grace and unrivaled good looks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waaaa--------!!

Twinkle light!
Twinkle bright!!

Waaa------pang!!
Woooo-----poy!!
Wa, waa, waaaaa...!!!

Uh huh...!
Oh yeah...! ♥ Master Star!
Fill my eyes with the light of
that which I seek!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Alas...
At the moment, there are no
Star Pieces within your reach.

Do not give up hope, though.
There are some beyond my vision.

Trust in your lucky star and
you'll find people who possess
Star Pieces.

I must give you a full refund
for such a poor reading...
Please return to me again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Alas...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... My, my...♥
Hello there, Mario!

This spot is a little tight for
fortune-telling.
If you want your fortune read,
talk to me over the counter.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... Excuse me?
You want... ...my autograph?

My, my... Mercy!♥
Are you sure it's mine you want?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You really do? Well!
This is a first!
What shall I do...?

Ah...of course!♥

I don't mean to be a
stick-in-the-mud...but I'll give
you the autograph on one
condition.

A small favor...
I want you to visit my twin
sister and fetch a Crystal Ball
from her.

She lives in a back alley in
Dry Dry Outpost.
Her name is Merlee.

Well, Mario...
Would you♥?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you seen my sister yet?
I'm sorry...but I simply can't
give you an autograph until you
fulfill your promise.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Mercy!♥ Thank you!
I'll cherish this.

And for you...here is my
autograph, as promised.
It'll be valuable someday!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm the famous Merlow of
Shooting Star Summit.
I collect Star Pieces.
I have the biggest collection!

Mister!
You have any Star Pieces?
If you do, I'll swap some cool
Badges for them!

How 'bout it? Let's swap!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm the famous Merlow of
Shooting Star Summit.

Got any Star Pieces?
I'll swap my Badges for them.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you wanna trade Star Pieces
for Badges, do you?

But I don't have any more
Badges! You tapped me out!
I'm sorry. See you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You want to trade more?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Later!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Ahhh...
I can tell you don't have any
Star Pieces.
Sorry, then. No can do.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Which Badges do you want to
swap for?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ahh... Did you change your mind?
I see...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm going to exchange
"{x}" for
{#} Star Pieces.

The number of BP you'll need for
this Badge is "{#}".

Is this the Badge you want?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Ahh... Did you change your mind?
You're an indecisive guy!

OK, OK. You want to trade for a
different Badge?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right! These Star Pieces
really help round out my
collection!

Please come back and swap some
more with me sometime.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right then, mister.
Why don't we swap some more?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You don't want to?

Oh well. At least I was able to
add to my radical Star Piece
collection.

Please come back and swap some
more with me sometime.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You are Merlow, correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A letter for me?
From Merle in Starborn Valley?
Wow! News from my dad!

Thanks, Mr. Postman!
My dad writes all the time
because he worries about me.

My sisters and I are totally bad
about writing back, though.

Maybe I oughta write him a little
more often, huh?

This is a treasure that I've
kept for a long time. I'm gonna
give it to you as thanks.

You could always come back and
swap me something for it...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
can you hear me...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm going to open the entrance
to Star Way.

Enter this path without fear.
The Star Way continues all the
way up here to Star Haven.

We 7 Star Spirits will be waiting
for you here. We wish to give you
our remaining Power.

With this Power, you will be able
to stand up to the Star Rod
Bowser holds.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We anxiously await you...

Mario,
make haste to Star Haven!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good afternoon,
... or good evening, maybe?

In Star Haven you can see
stars all the time.

There used to be a lot more
shooting stars...but that was
before the Star Rod was taken.

The beauty of this place was
incredible back then...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When I first heard that all the
Star Spirits were captured and
the Star Rod was stolen,
I lost it.

I figured, this is it!
This is the end of the world!

But now, all of the Star Spirits
have safely returned.

It just goes to show you never
give up hope.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When the news first hit that
the Star Spirits had been taken
away, a friend of mine was so
shocked that he got sick.

His shining light faded way down
to a mere flicker.

Since the Star Spirits have
come back, he's regaining a
healthy glow.

You're a lightsaver, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Our precious Star Spirits have 
returned! Oh, happy day!
It's all because of you!

I guess we'll all "wish upon a
Mario" from now on!
Every Star owes you, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It gives me great joy to hear
of the Star Spirits' return.

Our only wish now is for the
return of the Star Rod.

It seems so odd...a Star making
a wish!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello!
Need a little rest?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Are you sure?
You seem pretty healthy to me.
Even so, would you care to stay
over anyway?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

See you again soon!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please relax.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Take care! Bye!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
you finally made it.

The time has come to take the
fight to Bowser's turf.

Now...
Hold still while we 7 join
together to bestow upon you
our final Power.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you use this Power, you can
drain the power of the Star Rod
whenever Bowser uses it.

Ah yes! And one more thing,
I have one final gift which
should come in handy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the legendary Star Ship
of Star Haven.
Bowser is keeping his castle
way up in the sky.

With this ship, however,
you can reach it.

Climb aboard!
On to Bowser's Castle!

We will always be with you.
Whenever you are in need,
use our Powers to help you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look... ...a shooting star!

Princess... come back...
Princess... come back...
Princess... come back...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you wish for something?
I hope your dreams come true.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Me too!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I want to see the princess...
I want to see the princess...
I want to see the princess...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I want to eat Shroom Cake...
I want to eat Shroom Cake...
I want to eat tons and tons of
Shroom Cake... 

Oh, shooting star...
Please fulfill my wishes...
Pretty please...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank heavens!
He's been gravely injured, but I
think he'll recover.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But Bowser has the Star Rod!
Now he's mightier than Mario!

It's hopeless! All is lost!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everybody just calm down.
As long as we keep it together,
there's always hope. Now...

Our fates are in Mario's hands.
We must try to revive him.

Gather round, everyone.
Send Mario your power!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew...that's it. That's all we
can do right now.

Mario...
Please get up... Please...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It really sounded like something
fell somewhere around here...

Oh...
Who could that be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This red shirt, this hat, and
this mustache...
You know, this really looks like
the one and only Mario!

It couldn't be...could it?
The real Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Hey! Wake up!
C'mon!! Up and at 'em!!

Oh no! He won't wake up!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, oh, what am I gonna do!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dad!!
Goom-pa!!
Goom-ba-rio!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
Can you hear me, Mario...?

I'm Eldstar, a Star Spirit...
I have something very important
to tell you...

It concerns the princess...and
all of the Mushroom Kingdom...

But sadly,
I haven't the strength to talk
to you here...

Mario...
I need to have you come to
Shooting Star Summit.

Please... Mario...
We Star Spirits will be waiting
for you at the summit...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...Mario!

I'm so happy
to see you awake!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You haven't opened your eyes
for days and days!
Everyone's been worried sick!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This place?

This is Goomba Village.
It's a tiny village that's just
west of Toad Town.

The only residents are me and a
single family of Goombas.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Goombas in the family are
just the nicest folks you'll ever
meet.

They're the ones who found you
unconscious in the forest and
carried you here to get better. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...?
A Star with a mustache?
You're saying a star told you to
go to Shooting Star Summit?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No, I saw nothing like that.
And I sure didn't see anyone
come in or out of this house.

I wonder, Mario...
Maybe you just had a dream?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Although maybe not...
It could have been some sort of
message from a Star Spirit.
They live in Star Haven.

Shooting Star Summit is the 
nearest place to Star Haven, so
that would make sense...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who knows? In any case, I'm glad
to see you've recovered.

I know the Goombas would be
happy if you paid them a visit.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please feel free to come here
anytime you get tired.

A good nap will work wonders
when you're feeling weak.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Toad House's slogan is...
"Refresh your Body and Mind!"

Anytime you feel tired, a good
rest will fix you right up.

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome to the Toad House! Our
slogan is, "Refresh your Body
and Mind!"

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Really?
You look pretty healthy to me.
Are you sure you want to take a
nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Make yourself comfortable and
enjoy your stay.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Take care now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh, you startled me!
Hm, yes, Mario, isn't it?

So you've awakened at last!
Good! Knew you'd pull through!

Call me Goompa.
I'm the Goomba grandfather,
so...I'm Goompa.

I'm sorry, but would you mind
giving me the details later?

I'm pretty busy fixing the
veranda.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you feel that earthquake the
other day, young feller? It
caused all kinds of damage.

But little by little, Goompapa
and I are fixing it all up.

Folks are saying the center of
the earthquake was right at
Princess Peach's Castle.
Boy, I sure hope not.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Never worry, kids, here I am.
Thanks to young Mario here, I
made it back all right.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, is that thing locked?
Let me open it up for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goompa!
Where've you been?

I looked outside and...wow!
Both you and the veranda were
just plain gone!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goompa,
I was very, very worried about
you! Really worried!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sorry, kids, I apologize. 
I didn't mean to make you fret.
You just take it easy, now.

I'm back safe and sound.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now!

Before I forget, I've decided to
give you something, Mario.
Wait here a minute.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
Hey... That dolly you've got...
That's the one Goombaria lost!

She was looking all over for it.
Would you give it back to her?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Aw, that's just mean, Mario...

I guess you can just give it
back when you're done with it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's my dolly! Dolly, dolly!
You're back!!
Thank you so much!♥

I'm so happy...
My sweet dolly! Don't you ever
get lost again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's a present from me!
Look at the pretty glitter!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And take this, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You always seem to beat up your
enemies... Do you work out?

I study self-defense by reading
books by the masters and
listening to Dad and Goompa.

And, I also exercise every day
so I can be strong like you!
It's starting to show, too! I'm
getting big muscles!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, Goombario's head is hard
as a rock now! Tee hee! 

When he does his Headbonk move,
it really, really hurts!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, be quiet, Goombaria! You're
embarrassing me!
Of course, it IS true...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sorry to have kept you waiting,
Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's OK, Goompa!
We're just rapping with Mario...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh. "Rapping," huh? Sorry.
I wanted to give this to Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is called a Badge.

If you wear this, you'll be able
to do a Power Jump, which means
you'll be able to do a lot more
damage with your Jump attack.

But listen here, and listen well.
You'll only be able to do it if
you're wearing the Badge.

You'd better try it first.
Putting Badges on and taking
them off is a vital skill. 

Would you like a quick lesson in
how to use the Badges you
collect during your travels?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You'd better listen, Mario. This
is really important!
Could I please give you a brief
lesson in Badges?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

All right, I trust you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK, then press {S}.
The menu will open.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now remember, you need
FP (Flower Points) to use this
Power Jump technique.

{Recovery Block}
 Do you remember that we
 saw a block like this on the
 way back to the village?


Well, these blocks will restore
not only HP but also FP.

They're lifesavers, Mario! Use
them whenever your HP and FP
reserves are getting low.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By the by, Mario,
I heard from Gooma...

You're taking it upon yourself to
try to rescue the princess
from Bowser's clutches.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh yeah! Mario can beat Bowser
with one hand tied behind his
back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hush, now, Goombario. Mario,
please take this Hammer.

It should serve you well. If I
were just a bit younger, I'd
accompany you on your trip. I'd
have done some damage!

The years have started to weigh
on me, though. I tell you, this
lower back pain...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Adventure...you're so lucky!

Princess-rescuing is so cool!
I really want to be an
adventurer, too, someday!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Me too!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Here's an idea!
Goombario...

Perhaps the timing is perfect.
You are no longer a child, and
evil times are upon us.

I'm sure Mario will agree...
You should accompany Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!? Really!? May I go,
Goompa!? May I really go!? 

Yes!!!!! Oh yeah!!!

Mario! You won't regret this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Way to go, Goombario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
I know Goombario will prove to be
a worthy companion.

...Well, I think it's about time for
my nap. I'll be in the house.

Good-byes have a way of making
this old Goomba get weepy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is so cool! Mario!
Let's go!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is so cool! Mario!
Let's go!!

But wait...
Your HP looks a little low.

Maybe you ought to take a rest
at the Toad House.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! Goombario,
I expect that you'll become a
fine, upstanding young Goomba by
the time you return.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you should know that
danger lurks everywhere.
It can even strike while you're
fixing the veranda!

I know you get used to danger
while you're adventuring, but
don't ever scoff at it!
You should always be careful!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So, Mario, how goes the
adventure thus far?

Are you keeping cool?
Keep your wits about you and
you'll beat Bowser hands down.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, how have you been?
You must have traveled all over
the Mushroom Kingdom by now!

Is Goombario pulling his weight?

The day you beat Bowser will be
a fine time, yes indeedy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario, how are you doing? I'm
waiting for the day you come
back a full-grown Goomba of the
world!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Even out here we hear stories of
your remarkable deeds!

Keep up the good work!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario,
Your family misses you.
Come back to us soon!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goompa,
I'll do my best!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Goompa, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now what could this be...?
Koopa Koot...?
Eh...I have a bad feeling about
this, so I'll read it later.

It's probably the old Koot's usual
backstabbing gossip.  
He really needs to get out more.

What's the point of sending all
of these gossipy letters? Huh?

I know you're pretty busy, so
thanks for delivering this.
Why don't you take this as a
token of my thanks?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm, Mario.
It looks like something else is on
your mind.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!?
Koopa Koot said he wants "The
Tape" back?

That old Koopa...
How does he remember things
from so long ago?

OK...
Wait for just a minute. I'll bring
it out for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here. This is it.
When you see that old Koopa,
give him my regards.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's that?
You want to know what's on The
Tape, do you?

Oh, no no... I'm sorry...
I'm afraid I can't tell you at
the moment.

It was great, though!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey Mario!
I'm Goombario.
I'm your biggest fan!

You don't know what this means
for me to meet you! Seriously!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I know all about your
adventures around the world.
You've been everywhere!

And you always get the best of
the bad guys. Every time!

You're the coolest!
I wanna be just like you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I know all about your
adventures around the world.
You've been everywhere!

And you always get the best of
the bad guys. Every time! 

You're the coolest!
I wanna be just like you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Mario...
My dad was looking for you.
He said to tell you that he
finished fixing the gate.

So I guess now you can travel
east to Toad Town and Shooting 
Star Summit, huh?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey...I know that ol' Koopa!
That was Kammy Koopa!

She's way up in the ranks of the
Koopa clan. Some people call her
the brains behind Bowser.

Boy, she sure looked like one
mean Koopa, didn't she?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Howdy, Mario!
Feeling better?

Feel free to rest in our house.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You what?
You have to leave right now?

...Oh, Shooting Star Summit.
Something important, no doubt.
Well, I believe that the summit
is near Toad Town.

You'll have to wait a bit.
I have to fix this gate before
you can head out to the east.

That earthquake the other day
really did a job on it.
Did you feel that quake? Shoot!
I thought the sky was falling.

Just relax and don't worry. I'll
have this fixed in a jiffy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Just a little while longer...
This hinge on the bottom of the
gate is kind of tricky.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hoo! What a job! Sorry to have
kept you waiting.
The gate is finally fixed.

If you take this road straight
ahead, you'll eventually reach
Toad Town, the home of Princess
Peach's Castle.

I believe that Shooting Star
Summit is just beyond there.

It's too bad you can't stay... I
feel like I just met you! But
duty calls, I know.
Come back and visit if you can.
 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Howdy, Mario!
Feeling better?

Feel free to rest in our house.

It's not such a shabby place. It
may look a little unkempt at the
moment, but I'm fixing all the
earthquake damage.

In fact, I just spent ages
fixing this gate.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You what?
You have to leave right now?

...Oh, Shooting Star Summit.
Something important, no doubt.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Best of luck, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Heee!! Yee hee heee!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleah heh heh heh...
Ah, my instincts were right...

Mario... I can't believe you're on
your feet after taking such a
beating from King Bowser.

You're a hardy one, all right.
I was smart to come here to
check on you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whuh...what? What's that,
Daddy!?
What's that weird flying thing?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Weird? You rude little...
I am a beautiful Koopa with a
beautiful name: Kammy Koopa! 

Hmmmph!!
I wish I had time to teach you a
lesson, brat! But no.

Mario! Hear this!
It is useless for you to try to
save Princess Peach. Ridiculous!
Laughable!

As you have seen, King Bowser is
more powerful than even you can
deal with this time.

Here's a gift from him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyeah heh heh heh!

Mario! You will kneel and weep
when you see the wonderful
changes King Bowser's made! 

Your world is ours now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleah heh ho hyuck heh heh HA!! 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ummmmmm...
I just fixed that gate... 

Nobody say "gate" to me...

Kammy Koopa, that fiend!
Did you hear what she said about
the princess?

It didn't sound good. I hope
nothing's happened to her...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wha... Wha... What!?
Bowser went and kidnapped 
Princess Peach?! Again?!

Oh, unbelievable! And now you
have to go to Shooting Star
Summit and help save her, right?

Ummmm...
This could be a problem.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dad, we've just gotta do 
something, right?

Mario's gotta save the princess!
Nobody else can do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ummmmmmm...

Oh, here's an idea!

Maybe we can break this block
with Goompa's big Hammer!

I think he's using it now to fix
the veranda.

Go ask him for it, will you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think Goompa is fixing the
veranda on the house.

I'm thinking his Hammer might be
able to break this block.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dad!
Did ya hear? I'm going out
adventuring with Mario!

I'll make you proud, Dad, I swear
it! Just wait!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do your best, son.
You've grown into a strong boy. I
know you'll be a great help.

It's a good thing you've spent so
much time training, huh?

Now do your old Goompapa proud!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There we go! Problem solved.

I have a feeling your road will be
lined with difficulties, so try not
to overdo it.

Be watchful, yet stay cool.
A calm mind is the wisest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hang on now, Mario!
I noticed you aren't wearing the
Badge Goompa gave you.

You know, that Badge won't do
anything if you don't wear it.
I think you'd better put that
thing on before you go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's simple, Mario.
Just keep going straight on this
road to find Toad Town.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Howdy! Welcome back to Goomba
Village, Mario!
How's the adventure going?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Howdy, Mario.
How're you doing?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Howdy, Mario.
How's my son Goombario doing?

Hey, by the way, I named the lad
after you, Mario.

I always wanted my son to grow
up to be strong like you.

He went a little overboard... Now
he's way too energetic!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario, how goes it, son?

I can't wait to hear about all
the remarkable things you're out
doing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It must be pretty gloomy around
the castle, huh?
I'm sure the people there are
depending on you, Mario.

The only way to help them is to
beat Bowser and save Princess
Peach. Please hurry!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario,
do your best to help Mario, OK?

I'll make a wish to the Stars for
you to have good luck.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Goompapa, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, thanks. Much obliged, Mr.
Postal Worker!
...Oh, great news! 

Fishing is one of my hobbies, and
this is from a friend who's
planning a fishing trip. 
I can't wait... 

...Oh...
Sorry to pile work on you, but
could I give you a letter?

If it's at all possible for you,
could you deliver this to a Toad
named Muss T.? He hangs around
the castle garden.

I'd really appreciate it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mr. Goompapa! Parakarry here.

I have a letter for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you, sir. What would we do
without postal service?

Oh, how interesting... A letter
for Goombaria.
I guess I could open it...

I remember she wrote a letter
just the other day and I was
wondering what it was.
I see. I guess it was a question.

And this seems like the answer.
It looks pretty complicated...
but I think I understand.

I'll tell her all about it.

Thanks so much for the prompt
delivery.
Here, take this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, land sakes! Mario!
So nice to meet you! My!

I'm so glad you woke up! I can't
tell you how worried I was when
you were just lying there asleep
for so long.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You should know that my son,
Goombario, is a big fan of yours.

All he does the livelong day is
train and tell people how he
wants to be great like you.

I tell him, "Goombario! It's all
well and good to train, but don't
you go getting into danger!"
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goompa...?
I thought he was fixing the
veranda.

I think...
He most likely had the Hammer
you're looking for, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mom!
I get to go with Mario!
I promise when I come back, I'll
bring home souvenirs!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, my little baby! I can't
believe you're going out into the
world with Mario!

Now you listen!
You be a good boy, you hear!
Don't cause Mario any trouble!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I know, Mom, sheesh. I'll be good.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario, you mind your mom!
Wear a sweater when it's cold!
Don't be picky about your food!
Don't start fights! Be polite!

Don't boast about all the things
Goompa taught you
as if you already knew them!!

And remember... And...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Urgh...
Mom always nags me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now hush! Mario,
please take good care of my
sweet little Goombario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, please take good care of
my sweet little Goombario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, land sakes! Mario!
Is my Goombario bothering you?

He can be a real handful,
sometimes, so I worry...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh...
Mom! C'mon, cut it out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that Toad Town has
finally calmed down a bit.
Finally! It's been ages since I
went shopping in peace!

We owe it all to you, Mario.
...Or maybe, possibly, my dear
son Goombario helped? A little,
perhaps?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario, c'mere.
I'm sure you're working hard.

Let me just get that gunk off
your face. Hold still.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
C'mon, Mom, quit it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I do love to shop, but the
problem with Toad Town is that
there are just too many things.

Still, it's nice to be in a busy
area now and then.

I think the next time I shop, I'll
bring Goombaria.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario, good luck, sweetie!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you look better.
I'm so glad...

I was really worried about you,
because you were lying there in
the forest and you didn't open
your eyes at all the whole time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was the one who found you,
you know, Mario. Me! Goombaria!

I was in the forest and I found
you and then I called Daddy and
Goompa and Goombario.

And then they came and got you
and I'm glad you're better!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was the one who found you,
you know, Mario. Me! Goombaria!

I was in the forest and I found
you and then I called Daddy and
Goompa and Goombario.

And then they came and got you
and I'm glad you're better!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wanted to go with you, too, you
know, but Daddy told me it was
too dangerous, so I have to stay
here instead. Hmmph.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goompa! Come out here! Mario's
in trouble!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's not fair! Goombario always
gets to do all the fun stuff!
Mario, when I grow up, can I go
on an adventure, too?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Have you been beating up
lots and lots of bad guys?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! I wanna go with you like
Goombario gets to!

You go to all kinds of pretty
towns and places, don't you?
I wanna go, too! I wanna go!
Why can't I go, too?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're just a little too young
right now, Goombaria.
You wouldn't believe how hard life
is out on the road.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shut up, Goombario!
Stop smiling! I wanna go, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everyone in the world is counting
on you, huh, Mario?
How do you deal with the
pressure all the time?

Well, if it helps at all, you can
depend on me, Mario.
I'll grow up extra fast so I can
help you out! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goombario,
do you actually do anything?
I never hear about anything you
do. Only Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course you don't hear!!
My role is to assist Mario, not to
be the hero.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...?
Really...? You fibber...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please take care of Goombario,
OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait, Mario!!

That dolly you're holding is mine.
I know it!

Give it back! Pretty please?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That dolly you are holding is
mine, I know it!

Give it back! Pretty please?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You meanie, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, thanks, Mario!
You're sweet!♥

Here, you can have this.
Isn't it pretty, the way it
glitters in the sun?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And take this too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario. Hello, dearie.
You may call me Gooma.

I'm a Goomba grandmother, so
that's where I got the name.
Ho ho ho ho.

Have you already met my lovely
grandchildren? Aren't they
sweet?

Especially little Goombaria. Why,
she looks just like I did when I
was young...
Ho ho ho ho.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're quite a looker, aren't
you?
Why, if I were just 10 years
younger, and single, of course...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you looking for Goompa?
He was just on the veranda.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good health is all that matters!
Stay healthy no matter what.
Don't overwork yourself, and
take a rest when you're weary.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Take care, Goombario.
You're already one fine Goomba!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have a bad feeling in my bones
these days.
Evil things are afoot, I think.

I wish that everyone could just
live together in peace.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What lovely weather today!
The laundry's already dry.

How's my Goombario doing? 
I get so much joy just seeing
my grandchildren's cute faces...
Ho ho ho!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is Goombario leaving again?

I miss you when you're not
around here, little Goomba!
You hurry up and finish this trip
and come home to Gooma!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sure our little Goombario is
trying his best and is doing all
sorts of great deeds.

But I still miss him when he's
gone, you know.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sure our little Goombario is
trying his best and is doing all
sorts of great deeds.

But I still miss him when he's
gone, you know.

Goombario...
When will you be able to stay
at home for a while?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, my back... Hm? Who's that?
That you, Mario?

I remember a great crashing
noise and then the veranda
collapsed and I fell.

Did you fall, too?
Just stepped out the door into
thin air, did you?

Well, we're both OK. Problem is,
we can't get home because that
block is in the way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This block...
This block shouldn't be here.
Well, this is a problem for us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
......Huh?
A Hammer? Oh, of course!
Um... Where did it go?

I was using it to fix the
veranda, so it's likely around
here somewhere...

Hm! Nowhere to be seen.
I guess it must have fallen
somewhere over there.

Mario, we'd better look for it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Hammer has got to be
somewhere close by.

{Hammer}
 It looks just like this.


Look for bushes that might cover
it up.

If "!" appears over your head,
you can press {A} to search. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!! There we go!
That's it! That's the Hammer!

I'll wager that if you use that
Hammer, you can break the block
that's in our way.

You can also use the Hammer to
hit trees and make them sway.
Sometimes stuff will fall out!

You can use it by pressing {B}.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Well now!
I believe that's the dolly that
Goombaria said she lost!

She'll no doubt be overjoyed if
you give it back to her.

So many people lose things all
over the place, you know.
It almost makes one feel like
looking around everywhere...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm... Well!
We found the Hammer, so I guess
we should head for home.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Youch!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who are you guys!?
This is my playground, idiots!

Nobody sets foot in here without
my permission! Nobody!

Prepare to start crying at the
feet of Master Jr. Troopa!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
this is Jr. Troopa. He's the boss
of the neighborhood gang. A bit
of a bully, obviously.

He's more bark than bite. You
can beat him easily.

Just boost yourself up and don't
take any lip!

I'll stay right here behind you
and watch your progress.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, excellent!
Good move! Go on!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrr!!
I'm just getting warmed up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
you've almost got him!
Keep it up! Go on!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, you asked for it!
Say hello to Jr. Troopa's special
attack!

Full power!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
that was wonderful fighting. You
got Star Points!

You get Star Points every time
you beat an enemy.

Every time you save up 100 Star
Points, you'll go up a level.

Always try hard to get points!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shoooooot!!
I was winning, too! 
I'll be back, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I mean it, I'll be back!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Heads up, Mario!
I see bad Goombas ahead.
They're loyal to Bowser.

If they see you, they'll attack
you without hesitation.

If you can successfully attack
an enemy in the field with a
Jump or Hammer,

you'll get the First Strike when
you enter the battle.

Striking first really helps when
it comes to battling.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen up, Mario.
The enemy's flying. 
Your Hammer won't reach
enemies in the air.

To attack airborne enemies, use
a Jump attack. 

You can jump over one enemy to
attack one behind it, too.
This is good advice. Remember it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Spiked Goomba.
See the spike on his head?

Be careful not to jump on him.
You'll definitely get hurt.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey Mario,

during a battle, you can change
the order we attack in with {Z}.

I can attack first if you want.
I don't mind at all!
Just keep it in mind, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey hey! Hold it right there!
You! Yeah you, suspicious guy!
Don't move!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aha, you're Mario!
I knew it. You can't go past
here, Mr. Big Shot.

It's a direct order from the
Goomba King. That's right!

I'm sorry, but the only way by
is through the Goomba Bros.
That's me, Red Goomba, and my
brother, Blue Goomba.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's get him, Blue Goomba!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh yeah! Let's do it, my red
brother!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
How'd you like some of this?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Re... Red Goomba, my brother...
Noooooo! You meanie, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Blue, Blue Goomba!!!!!
Gaaah! My little brother! You'll
pay for that, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Geeaaaah!!!
I... I'll let you go for now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
King Goomba! Help us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario beat us up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, look, Mario!
See that building over there?

I'm pretty sure there used to
be a bridge on the other side.
I wonder what happened to it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So, Mario, it's true! You've made
it this far. 
I respect you for that.

Unfortunately, this is as far as
you'll ever get.

Because I, the great and
powerful King Goomba, will see to
it that you advance no farther!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You hear that, Mario! No
farther! Not one step!
Are you scared, little man?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bah ha ha!!!
Yeah, you're scared, all right.
You wanna say you're sorry?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow... That King Goomba is...
really huge!

I'm sure he's no match for you,
though, Mario!
Let's get him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ready to meet my wrath, Mario?
You'd better be!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Beat him up, King Goomba!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We've got your back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Leave him to me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey Mario!
I think maybe we ought to take
out the Goomba Bros. first, don't
you think?

They must be pretty weak since
we just finished beating them up
back there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no! It can't be! King
Goomba!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I don't believe it! He beat our
King Goomba!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wh...wh...what!?
How could I lose?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah! I knew we could do it!
Cooool!! Victory!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Red Goomba,
you're positive that you hid the
switch well, right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course, King Goomba!
I hid it in the grass outside the
fortress. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Outside the... You idiot!
You didn't hide it in here? Mario
will find it for sure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Do you think?
You know...you might be right.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
King Goomba,
maybe we ought to try to trick
Mario before he tries to...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...Mario!
Good fight and all that! I must
warn you, however...

If you happen to find a strange
switch somewhere, you should
definitely not press it.
It's dangerous. Understand?

......you what?
You already pressed it?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh nooo!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look! The bridge!!
Now we can cross it and continue
our journey. All right!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder what my brother Mario
is doing right now...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! Mario!
It's you! Good to see you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And you're all right!
After all that castle craziness,
I was really worried about you.

I ran outside just as the
earthquake started, so I
managed to escape in time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh? And who are you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm Goombario.
Nice to meet you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Luigi, right?
My name's Kooper.
Pleasure meeting you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Luigi, huh?
I'm Bombette.
Nice to meet you!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The name's Parakarry.
I'm helping Mario out on his
adventures.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see. Great, just great.
You're on an exciting adventure
with Mario. Talk about unfair.

See, someone has to look after
this house, so I can't leave. Oh
well. Take care of Mario, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody sure has to save the
poor princess. Good luck!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good luck, Mario. You just have
to save that princess!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I'll go to any lengths to
help you out.

I have lots of talents, and I can
jump really high and...

What? Stay home and take care
of the house?
Man, that's not exciting at all!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Koopa Bros.?
You mean they're a bunch of
brothers who're Koopa Troopas?
Tough name to remember, huh?

I have an idea, Mario!
Why don't we give them a taste
of our Mario Bros. power!

I'll join you and together...

What? I can't? Why not?
Come on, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi, Mario.
I figure I'll have an adventure
sooner or later, so I'm training.

What's that? Dry Dry Desert?
Oh, sure. There's a train that
goes there from Toad Town.

Hey, maybe I'll tag along...

No? You sure?
Just gimme a chance!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder how ol' Mario is doing in
his quest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ma... Mario!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh-oh... I mean, never mind.
How did you find this place?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's nothing on the desk.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Anything wrong?
Nothing suspicious in the
basement, was there?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huff huff...
You wouldn't believe it... Shy
Guys were everywhere...

They moved...like the wind! Huff
huff... All I managed to do was
get really upset and yell.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huff Huff...
I'm a great jumper, but my
running really needs some work.

A little more training and I'll be
vital to your team...

All right, take it easy. I know I
can't go.
You go on your adventure. I
don't even want to anymore.

I know that it's up to you to
save Princess Peach, so hurry
up for my sake!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Hi, Mario. Are you doing OK?

Don't worry, Bro, I'll watch the
house until you get back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, hanging out way up high
sure was nice...  Such a great
view and everything...

Uh...never mind! Say, that's a
cool Hammer you got there!
I bet you can even beat up
enemies with hard shells now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, hanging out way up high
sure was nice... Such a great
view and everything...

Uh...never mind. Say, are those
new Boots? They look really
flashy!
Now you'll be a better jumper!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach is still caught
way up there in the sky...

C'mon, Mario!
You're a hero, Bro! You have to
save her!

There's a letter for Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's the box where letters
addressed to Mario go.
It's empty right now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's that, Mario?
You need something?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He what? 
Mr. Koopa Koot wants to get my
autograph? Me? He wants me to
sign something?

Whoa! Cool! I'm flattered!
I guess maybe I'm a little bit of
a celebrity, huh?

Wait one second.
I'll write it right now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here you are, Mario.
My autograph.

Give my regards to Mr. Koopa
Koot, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you want to go to bed?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're at peak strength. Do you
still want to go to bed?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Fully energized!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Can it be...? Are you Mario?
Welcome to Koopa Village!
I wish we could really welcome
you, but we're in big trouble.

Can't you see what kind of
madness is going on?

This village is in an uproar
because of the Fuzzies.

You...do know what Fuzzies are
like, don't you, Mario?


{Fuzzy}
 ← They look like this 



Mean guys.
They're really naughty.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! Stupid Fuzzy!
Get back here with my shell!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank you, Mario!
I owe you one.

I just can't walk around without
my shell on. Talk about
embarrassing!

Mario, be sure to keep your shell
safe from Fuzzies, all right?

...Oops. You don't have one.
Well, watch your overalls.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Say again?
You're looking for a Koopa with a
blue shell?
I bet you mean Kooper.

I think he's at home now.
Look for a house with a green
roof, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, did you already go see the
elder of the village? His name's
Koopa Koot, and he was looking
for you.

He said something about needing
something from you.

His house is at the far end of
the village. You really should go
visit him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey there, Mario.
Good to see you in Koopa Village
again.

How's the adventure going?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How're things, Mario?
Going swimmingly, I hope.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Kent C. Koopa came back,
and he's greedier than ever.
We can't even go to Toad Town
without paying a huge toll!

If I could just flip him over, I'd
bite his tail...
That's his weak point!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's been a while since I've been
shopping in Toad Town.

I bet I could read all about your
adventures in the newspaper
there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Koover, correct?

The name's Parakarry. 
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no!! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, thanks!
You came at a good time.
I was just about to send a
letter myself. 

Oh, would you look at this!
It's a letter from Muss T.!
The two of us are always
thinking along the same lines.

He's one of my fishing pals.
I'll tell you, if you don't fish,
you should! What a hobby!

And to think, I was just about
to send letters to all my fishing
buddies about a trip!

Once we have a good place set
up, I'll write a letter back to 
Muss T.

So...
...could you send this along for
me?
Thanks so much.

It's to a friend of mine who's
always fishing at the Toad Town
port. He's easy to find.

Thanks again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mr. Koover. Parakarry here.

I have a letter for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it.
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thanks!
Cool! It's from my pal!
This must be the answer to my
last letter.

Thanks for the speedy delivery.
Now I can send letters to the
whole gang.

It'll be great meeting up with
all the guys and fishing up a
storm.

I've already written one.
Here, can you take it?
It's to Mr. E, who lives in the
desert.

He'll most likely be hanging out
in front of the Toad House. He
wears a blue turban. 

You'll probably notice him right
off the bat.
Thanks for everything!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, woe! My shell's up there!
What'll I do...?
I can't reach that high!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you're the best!
Thank you very much!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yes I'm much more comfy
inside my shell.
Without it, I feel every little
breeze!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is it true that Kooper is joining
your adventure, Mario?

That's terrific!
Come back as a hero, Kooper!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By the way, I heard a rumor
that Princess Peach was
kidnapped recently.
I hope she's OK...

How many times has she been
kidnapped in her life, anyway?
Seems like a lot.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please do your best, Mario.
I'm trying to do mine.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You don't say? A giant Koopa
named Kent C. Koopa is blocking
Pleasant Path?

...I remember him! Ever since he
was little, he's been able to fall
asleep anytime, anywhere.

It used to be impossible to wake
him up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder what Princess Peach is
doing right now.

I'm wishing to the Stars that she
returns home safely.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Curse those stupid Fuzzies!
They put my shell in the tree!

How can they be so mean for no
reason?
That was my best shell!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks, Mario!

This shell was made to order.
That's why it fits me so well. 
I mean, how cool do I look?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks, Mario!

This shell was made to order.
That's why it fits me so well. 
I mean, how cool do I look?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Koopa Bros. of the fortress
used to live in this village. 

They left, though, because they
said it just wasn't exciting
enough around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I remember Kooper used to
always talk about traveling the
world as an explorer.

Going with Mario is a great
chance to travel, isn't it?
Make us proud, Kooper!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I finally bought a new shell.

What do you think?
Don't you think the glossy finish
really brings out the trim?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kent C. Koopa used to live in
this village.

But he always insisted that we
pay him money for no reason.

What an extortionist! If you
want to hear stories about him,
ask anybody in this village.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...
Oh, did you say something?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Supposedly, these Bob-ombs
recently ran away from the
Koopa Bros. Fortress.

Of course, things aren't much
better here in the village.
The Fuzzies are running wild!
Poor little Bob-ombs...

Huh? Me?
I don't leave my house because I
couldn't bear it if the Fuzzies
made a fool of me. 

They'd probably take my shell
and play with it. I know I don't
look cool without my shell. Nope.

No, thank you. I'd rather just
stay here and listen to music.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! We can go outside again
because the Fuzzies are gone!
Stupendous! Spectacular!
It's time to bask in the sun!

A little music on the radio,
a little sunshine on my shell...
Does it get any better?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, I love this song!

Doesn't it remind you of a
tropical island?
Get down! Yow!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, I love this song!

Golden oldies remind me of the
good old days. 
Sing it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, this song always brings
tears to my eyes...

So moving...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, hey! Hands off the dial!
That's my jam, right there!
Don't turn off the funk!
I was getting my groove on!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Welcome to our Toad House!
Our slogan is, "Refresh Your
Body and Soul!"

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Really?
You look fine to me, Mario.
Are you sure you want a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where are your manners, Mario?
You shouldn't climb on the table.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Have pleasant dreams.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Great! Have a good adventure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Mort T., correct?

The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A letter? For me?
Oh, it's from my wife!
How sweet! I love her so...

.......... Phew...
Oh, pardon me. I got really
wrapped up there.

That wife of mine!
She's so cute! She makes me
crazy!

Thanks for bringing me joy!
Here, take this, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You must listen!

The Koopa Bros. in the fortress
worked us too hard.

As far as they're concerned,
laborers have no rights.

I will never, ever go back to
work in such a terrible place.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

The Koopa Bros. in the fortress

It was a long road, but I'm still
glad I ran away.

I'd rest easier if I knew those
Koopa Bros. had been punished.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I decided to stay here with my
friends for a while.
It's a nice place.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bombette will be victorious!
You can bet your bombs on it...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm a Bob-omb.
I love to bomb-bomb!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're Bob-ombs. We just ran
away from the Koopa Bros.
Fortress.

We thought we'd at least find
some peace here in the village.
Boy, were we wrong. The Fuzzies
are running wild around here.

All we want is a little peace...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course we're happy that we
made it out of the fortress...
but we still worry constantly
about our imprisoned friends.

They didn't make it out with us.
Oh, what a tragedy!

I wish there were some way that
we could rescue them. 
Sigh...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Finally... Without those Fuzzies
it's so peaceful here.

But what good is peace for us if
our friends are still stuck in
jail inside the fortress?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bombette! You're safe!?
Oh, joy!!
I was so worried about you! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario rescued me.

So I figured the least I could
do was help him even the score
with Bowser, King of the Koopas!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good luck, Bombette!
We Bob-ombs will all be wishing
you luck! Bombs away!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's a little something I put
together to wish Mario and
Bombette luck! Bomb-bomb!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Explosion is a fine art!
Bomb-bomb!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bombs away, Mario!
We wish you the best of luck!
Bomb-bomb, ker-BOMB!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Way to beat the Koopa Bros.!

Now we can all live in this village
in peace and harmony.
Freedom is glorious!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I feel...so very happy...
...surrounded by friends...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We salute you! Buh-bomb!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Some of our other friends who
were also in the fortress are
living in that vacant house over 
there now.

I guess I should go over and
visit one of these days.
...Because, you know, nothing is
more precious than friendship.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yeah... the air out here is
so wonderfully clear.
The oxygen content really helps
me make huge explosions!

My ambition is to make an
explosion so loud that all of
Mushroom Kingdom will hear it
and be amazed.

Tee hee hee...
I'm burning up with the very
idea of such a blast!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's not fair that bad guys'
wishes always come true, and
good guys' wishes don't!

By the way, we get really angry
just before we explode.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Fuzzy took my shell!

I ran after it, but it just
laughed and taunted me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No matter how fast I run, I
can't catch that guy! I can't
believe this...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Typical Mario style!
You're just as cool as I heard
you were!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can't help but think that
Fuzzies'll steal my shell again.

I can't relax. Just being outside
makes me nervous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fuzzies are gone now. Phew!

To tell the truth, though, it's
a bit boring here now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What'll we do if those Fuzzies
come back sometime!

They might take our shells again!
Those rascals!
How strangely thrilling...
Oh... my heart...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's up, Mario?
I've been hearing about all the
adventures you've been on.

Since Kooper's traveling with
you, there's always news coming
to the village.

Good luck, all of you!
I'll be rooting for you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The stars are beginning to
appear more clearly.

Maybe now our wishes will come
true again, and everything will
turn out just fine.

I can only hope that we won't
see such bad times again.
A quiet village...a little peace.
That's all I need to be happy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wahhhhhhhhh! What a world!
My favorite shell! I just washed
it!

A Fuzzy put it up there!

How will I ever get it?
Please tell me! Help, somebody!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Fuzzy put my favorite shell up
there!

How will I ever get it?
Please tell me! Help, somebody!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I might have known!
You're so clever, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll be careful not to let anyone
near my shell ever again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those Fuzzies were a real pain
in the shell, but it seems too
quiet without them.

To be honest, I wouldn't mind if
they came by once in a while...

Don't tell anyone I said that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you know Mr. Kolorado?

He's one of the bright lights of
Koopa Village.
He's a professor of archaeology,
don't you know.

We haven't seen him back here
since he went to Dry Dry Desert
to study some ruins.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You must be tired from your
adventuring.

You can rest all you like here in
Koopa Village!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To me, pure happiness is a life
of peace.
Once in a while, though, I like a
little excitement.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You Fuzzies won't beat me!
Behold my power!

Goahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Wheeze... How was that?
Super power, wasn't it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mr. Kolorado is a famous
archaeologist from here. 

He hasn't been back here to his
house since he went to Dry Dry
Desert.

Mr. Kolorado's wife is always
worrying about him.

They live in that house over
there with the yellow roof.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mr. Kolorado is a famous
archaeologist from here.

That house with the yellow roof
is his.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If I use my strength, don't you
think I can save this village? 
Then you won't have to.

OK, then!
I'll try my best!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can trust me to keep the
peace in this village!

But others need your help!
Good luck, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I put a high-tech lock on my shell
so that the Fuzzies can't take
it. 

They'll never manage to pry it
off me now! Ha ha!
I'm not sure if I can even get it
off, to be honest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fuzzies are gone.

You know, I didn't hate them,
even though they were naughty.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, everybody's saying that
their wishes aren't coming true
these days. 

Aren't our wishes getting
through to the Stars anymore?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Basking out in the sun feels
really, really good.
...So sleepy...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...

Oh, hi there! Feel free to
relax, OK? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bombette...you're...you're
joining Mario's adventure?

It's really lonely without you.
My heart will break if you go.

Please! I beg you! Take me with
you wherever you go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
One Bob-omb is enough.

You should stay here instead.
Take care of the village!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you're so cruel, Bombette...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sigh... Bombette...
I worry about you constantly.
Double sigh...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
"Bombette!" "Bombette!"
It's all he ever says!
It's so annoying!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Bombette!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shut up!
She probably dumped you 'cause
you never stopped talking!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No, you shut up!

My love for Bombette is deep
like the southern sea! Bomb!
Even being dumped constantly
won't discourage me! Ba-bomb!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you hear this guy, Bombette?

He never, ever stops talking
about you! Bud-a-bomb!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Bombette!!!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shut up! Please! Right now!
Think about something else for
two seconds, will ya?

You're really starting to get on
my nerves!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bombette, I'm putting my whole
heart into this next explosion! 

Watch it and see my true love!
Bomb, bomb! Bip-bomb!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Bombette!!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
The neighbors are starting to
complain about your noise!
Quit your bellyaching!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Bombette!!!!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You be quiet now!
It's no use yelling my name!

I'm off on an adventure, doing
very important things.

I have enough to think about
without your puppy love! And
besides, you're not my type!

I told you that before! So calm
down before you blow a fuse.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bombette... Oh don't...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh, you made her angry...
I feel bad for you, but man...
You talk way too much. 

You need to play it cool, or
she'll never like you at all.
I'm sure she'll come around one
of these days if you can just...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Bombette!!!!!
Please don't say that! Please!

Don't you care how I feel?! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, shut up!! Enough already!
Stop brooding over her!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's in love with Bombette.

But she doesn't like him because
he's so persistent.

Love is complicated...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please hurry up and beat
Bowser, will you?

Then maybe Bombette will come 
back, and he'll be quiet!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I don't see why we can't live in
this vacant house.

It'd be awesome!
We've wanted our own house for
the longest time!

But I guess we might have a
problem if the owner of the
house comes back, huh? 

We could always go back to the
fortress, I suppose.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
They're arguing in the house.
I'm not going in there...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please hurry up and beat 
Bowser, OK, Mario?

Say, you don't know when the
owner of this house is coming
back, do you?

We could always go back to the
fortress, I suppose.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These Fuzzies! Will their mischief
never end?

My husband is never here when
there's trouble.

My husband?

Oh, his name is Kolorado.
You've heard of him. He claims to
be a famous explorer.

Who knows if it's true or not...
He runs his mouth a lot.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My husband hasn't come back
since he left to find some ruins.

If you see him somewhere out
there in your travels, tell him
to come home once in a while!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, little Kooper is going to go on
Mario's adventure?
How cute... Take care!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think my husband went to Dry
Dry Desert, but who knows?
I wonder what he's doing now.

I swear! I send him letters, but
has he written back even once?
Of course not!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario, you won't believe it!
My husband...!

He came home out of the blue
the other day...
and he's already left again! Off
on some other fool's errand!

That infuriating Koopa...
I just can't believe him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My husband?
Oh, I think he went to some
southern island this time.

He heard something about lots
of treasure stashed in a
volcano on the island
and left shortly thereafter.

Pffff... He's obsessed!
He's like a spoiled little kid.
He always does what he wants.

Well... I suppose...
that's why I fell in love with him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My husband... Where is he now?
What's he thinking about...?

I just hope he's doing OK.
That's my only wish.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario,
my husband came home!

He sits around the house and
reads books about all the
treasures out there waiting...

It's so nice to have him home,
I can't even tell you.

Phew... My husband...
What a difficult man...
But I still love him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, do you need something?
You're doing an errand for the
elder, are you?

Mmmm...right, "Koopa Legends."
Yes, my husband owns that one.
Of course you can borrow it!

Don't let that old Koot work you
too hard, OK, Mario?
He's known to do that. He's also
a bit short-tempered.

Well, anyway.
Wait here for just a moment.
I'll go poke around my husband's
bookshelf.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Found it!
You're talking about this book,
right?
It's all yours.

It was behind the bookshelf.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's strange... That book...
it has all these pictures of
shells ...and exercises...
"Firmer shells in 30 days"?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, I'm back in the village.
It's rather nice, eh, old boy?

Adventure is all well and good,
but one's home is really tops!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So stay here for a change!

I've had just about enough of
sitting around worrying and
waiting for your return!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm...?

Ah... Yes...Of course, well...

............ahem!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Psssst...
To tell the truth, old bean,

I'm itching to search for the
lost palace in the north.

But tut-tut! Mum's the word as
far as the wife's concerned!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Mr. Kolorado, correct?

I think I have a letter for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Good heavens!
A letter from the wife!

I say...
...when did she write this?

Well, in any event,
cheers to you for bringing it with
such speed, eh?
You simply must take this.

Go on, then! I found it on scenic
Lavalava Island.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Dry Dry Ruins dig grew
tiresome for me. I left it in the
hands of my assistants.

I say...?

Mario,
that artifact you have...

That looks like... The subtle
craftsmanship... Indeed!
It's a clue to Dry Dry Ruins!

A careful study of this by my
learned eyes could well solve the
mystery of the ruins!

Mario! Old boy! Be a chum!
Could you part with it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...old chum...

If you could see to it to have
a change of heart, might I have
that artifact?

I can't stop thinking of it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hmmmmmmmmmm.........
Is there no way I can change
your mind, dear boy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I see... How very tragic.
Nothing to be done, I suppose.
I'm doomed to suffer...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Cheers, Mario!
Smashing, really, old boy!
You're too kind!

No regrets now, eh?

Soon now, the mysterious Dry Dry
Ruins will rise in glory from the
sands that conceal them!

As a brilliant archaeologist,
I say it must be so!

I suppose a thank-you gift is
in order, eh, old boy?
Here you go then!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think I'd best stay home for a
time to examine this.

Oh, thank you indeed, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the bookshelf in
Kolorado's room.
Most of the books seem to be
about archaeology.

There are also a few that seem
somewhat less intellectual.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's the world coming to when
a Koopa can't even step outside
for fear of Fuzzies?

I've lived many, many years, and
this is the first time I've seen
anything like this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, welcome, young fella!
I'm the elder of Koopa Village.
Folks call me Koopa Koot.

Say...might you do me a favor?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, what luck! You came at the
perfect time, young man!
Could you see your way to doing
me another favor?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's Mario, is it?
Nice weather we're having, hm?

I can't think of any favors I
need at the moment...
I bet I'll need one later, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're a good soul for helping
this old Koopa so many times.

Now Mario! 
I have one last favor to ask! 

That cad, Bowser...
You must defeat that evil King
Bowser once and for all!

The dear children of this village
will never sleep in peace as long
as Bowser rules.

I wish for nothing more than
peace and a reason for my
fellow Koopas to hope again.

Please help us, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario, is that you?
Have you decided to do this old
Koopa a favor?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh!!! Such rudeness!
The younger generation is so cold
and heartless!

You're all good for nothing!
Get out! Get out! Get out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh!!! How very kind of you!
I guess the younger generation
isn't so bad after all.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come again, sonny?
Are you saying you forgot the
favor I asked of you?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Eh?
You still haven't found time to
do my errand, young fella?
Well, run along then!

Or maybe... Did you perchance
forget what the favor I asked
of you was?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, you remember it! Then...
what do you say you hurry up
and do it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you done my errand?
If it's impossible, I suppose you
can give up.

You're still going to try?
Or maybe... Did you perchance
forget what the favor I asked
of you was?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Really? Well, I appreciate it.
Get a move on, now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hmmmmph.
All right, nothing to be done...

Although... Maybe you could still
be useful to me. Would you do me
another favor?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hmmmmmph.
All right, nothing to be done...
I can't say I'm pleased...

You young whippersnappers...
Go ahead, go home!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh,
you don't have to be so polite,
young fella.
Take this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, of course! Take this, too!

Did you know that there's a
Playroom in Toad Town?
If I remember right, it used to
be around the station.

It's strictly for members only,
so the entrance to it is well
hidden.
I bet you could find it, though.

This here's a Silver Credit. It'll
let you play once you're inside
the Playroom.

Back in my heyday I used to go
there and make a lot of money.
But I got tired of the hoopla.
So the Silver Credit's yours.

Good luck! Make some money!
Hee hee hee.....
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, by the way, have you been
going to the Playroom?

I found this old thing since the
last time I saw you.

Have a look: a Gold Credit.

They gave this to me at the
Playroom since I was such a
frequent visitor. 
You can have it now.

Good luck! Make money!
Hee hee hee.....

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who's there?
I'm kind of busy right now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!? Wait... Could it be...?!
Aren't you Mario!?

You are! My name's Kooper!
Oh, I'm so psyched to meet you!

Us meeting here has gotta be
fate or something.
I need a huge favor... I hope
you'll help me out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This wild Fuzzy took my shell,
which, next to my life, is the
most important thing I have.

I can't go out without my shell,
period. Way too embarrassing.

The problem is, the Fuzzies are
too fast for me to catch alone.

So if you don't mind, can you
help me get my shell back?
I'm begging you!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario.
It looks like he's in a bad way.
We ought to help him out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fuzzy that took my shell is
just inside my house.

I'll guard the door while you
grab him like: Whump!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeeooooooork!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've got outside covered!
Catch that Fuzzy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You get him yet, Mario?
No? You gotta, Mario! I really
need that shell!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeeooork! Meork!

Come get it if you can!
Nyeah, nyeah!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeeooork!

Yeah, run away, you coward!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeeeeoooooork!
Guess where I'm hiding?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meee-ooh?
Not bad, chump!

But that was just a warm-up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
York!? Meeoork?
You got me twice!?

Must've been luck!
Now I'm serious!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeeeooooooh, noooo!!!

I give! Uncle!

Here, take the stupid shell!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're too tough for me. I won't
be bad anymore, I promise.

...Maybe.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! There you are!
I realized I have to take a
stand against these Fuzzies!

If I can't get my own shell,
I'll lose my reputation!

I don't even care that I have
no shell on! I'm gonna show those
Fuzzies what's what!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We already got the shell back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What? You have my shell, but you
won't give it back?
What's the matter with you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's just plain cruel. Please
give it back to me!
A Koopa without a shell is like...
a really unhappy Koopa!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yes! Yes!
This is my shell, all right!

Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Got my shell back! Uh-huh!

You're the greatest, Mario!
I owe you big time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good to hear you're happy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Say, Mario...

I have an idea...

Do you happen to know Professor
Kolorado?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Naturally he's a Koopa who's a
professor of archaeology.
He's also known as an explorer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Right! Well, I live next to him.

I've been admiring Professor
Kolorado ever since I was in
my egg!

Nothing would make me happier
than traveling the world, solving
mysteries like he does!

So... Do you think.. Could I...
Please take me with you, Mario!
I'll help! C'mon, lemme go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What do you think, Mario?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, c'mon! You gotta!

I have lots of skills! I work well
with others! Really, please take
me along!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yes!! Yes!!
I'm on my way!

I swear, I, Kooper,
will follow you anywhere, even
to the ends of the earth!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeooreeeeork!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I changed my mind, sucker!
How about a fight?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Meeoooorkoooonooo!
We'll be good! We'll be good!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! Mario!! What the...!

Oh, we're in a world of hurt!
Mario's here already!
I gotta tell the leader!
Red Kooooooopaaaa!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha! Let's see the great Mario
get any farther now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeeek! Mario!

You, uh... Don't try any...
You'll still never find your way
through this fortress! 

Umm... It looks like there might
be some fighting here.
How exciting! See ya!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK! This is perfect...I think.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa!
Looks like Mario's here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bah ha ha ha ha! Loser! Serves
you right!
You fell for it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, what was that?
Where did that fall from?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...
I wondered what just fell,
but...aren't you...Mario?

I never in a million years thought
I'd meet such a famous guy in a
place like this.

...Who, me?

My name's Bombette. In case you
hadn't noticed, I'm a Bob-omb.
Pleased to meet you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's that...?
Why am I locked up here?
Because I'm a menace!

At least to these guys...
Those uncouth Koopa Bros.!

I was just one of many Bob-ombs
working here.

But those Koopa Bros....
Once Bowser took over, they
started working us into the
ground!

I couldn't take it anymore, so I
exploded next to them.

Yeah, that was a mistake.
The Koopa Bros. didn't like it.
So they locked me in here.

And then they locked up the rest
of the Bob-ombs because they
thought they might rise up.

You know, a Bob-omb rebellion!
What do you think about that?

...Oh, sorry...
It's a long story, I know.

Anyway, Mario,
we want to get out of here.

Do you think you could help spring
us from this place or what?
Pretty please?

If you help us...
I promise I'll return the favor.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, you...won't...
We're really hurting here, Mario.
And you won't help us?
I guess I was wrong about you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You changed your mind, Mario?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh...how depressing...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, how nice!♥
We'll be good friends from now
on, I can feel it!

We'll make a super team,
Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now. Let's think of a way to get
out of here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, gee, I almost forgot!

I haven't even told you about
what I can do. Silly me!

My specialty is exploding.
Check this out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
See, if there are any cracks in
a wall, I can probably break it.

Let me try this one.
Puff, puff, puff... Take cover!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
See that?
You see what I bring to the
party, Mario?

...?

Oh! An escape route!

Well, I...
I guess I never thought about
doing that before...

I was so mad, I just blew up
over and over in one place!

Tee hee!
OK, that was a little silly!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, anyway,
we can get out now, right?

And so can everyone else!
Thank you, Mario!

From now on I'll tag along and
help out wherever I can!
You just ask, and I'll be there
for you!♥

Now enough chitchat!
I have a little score to settle
with those Koopa Bros.!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All of us Bob-ombs got locked
in here by the Koopa Bros.
Nothing we could do about it.

The Koopa Bros. used to be cool,
but they got conceited because
Kammy Koopa likes them.

Before, they were just typical
young guys from Koopa Village.
They were nice enough.

I think maybe the desire for
adventure corrupted them.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't worry about us, Mario!
We'll find a way out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sorry, I simply will not obey
tyrants anymore!

Those Koopa Bros. can't squash
the pride of a Bob-omb!

So...
I'm using all my energy thinking
of a way to break out of here.

Hmmmm...
The angles...vectors...

ooooooog...
It's so complicated... My head's
going to explode!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All that thinking, and I never
thought of blasting the wall.

You're pretty darned smart!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, how long do we have to be
locked up here...?
I'm losing hope...

And I'm so hungry...
So sad...and mad...angry...
...I'm filling with rage! 

I'm really angry now!
I want out! OUT! Right now, you
hear me, Koopas!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was sad, mad... But now, glad!
Freedom! Yahoo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those stinking Koopa Bros.
worked us way too hard. 
They were making us work for 25
hours a day! Unreal!

Nobody's life should be all work,
right?

I need free time to make my
mark in the world. BOOM!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's get out of here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's all this noise?!

In case you Bob-ombs forgot,
exploding is prohibited inside
the fortress except in the case
of emergencies!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What in the...Mario!?
What're you doing here? 

Nothing good, I bet!
Everybody, get him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well, well! Mario!
I wouldn't have bet you'd make
it this far.

Pfffft...
Don't get smug, pal!

You just caught us off guard!

Trust me, we'll mop the floor
with you if we get serious!
We're as cool as they come! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, boys!!
Open fire!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You guys ready?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Black! What are you doing?!
Hurry, man! Shake a leg!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow! My shell! Get off!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait... Wait a minute...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, for the love of...
What are you doing, Yellow?!
That doesn't look cool at all!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, hang on...
OK! I'm ready, Red!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Finally!
Let's do this!
Remember to look cool, guys!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaaaaaaaa!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gah ha ha ha!!!!
I've been waiting for you, Mario!
Bwa ha ha ha har!

The strongest! And the coolest!
Behold the glory that is the
great Evil King Bowser!!

It's time for me to beat these
foolish ideas out of you! Saving
Peach? Please!!

Watch this and weep!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gah ha ha ha!!
I am invincible!

You are powerless before me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's the matter with you?!
This isn't even funny!
You can't even touch me!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gah ha ha ha!!!
Oh...ha ha...you're so weak...
ho ho...I can't stop laughing...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
(Heh heh heh... Mario really
thinks that we're King Bowser!)
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
(Shhhh!!! Mario'll hear us!)
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh, you're pathetic!
Are you always this weak?
The sequel should be called
"Paper Bowser"!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
(Um... Red! 
We've got rips in a lot of
different places here!)
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
(Forget about it! Mario's
shaking in his boots! Let's get
him!)
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no!!
That costume was perfect!!
Bowser loved it!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here come the Koopa Bros.!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Koopa Bros. special:
super spinning attack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whooooaa... We're going over!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, Mario!
Have a taste of this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Helloooooo?
Somebody, let us outta here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
I believe you'll save us all...

From the bottom of my heart,
I appreciate all you've done.
Thank you.

Since you have freed me from my
prison, the seal on my power is
broken, and I will recover it
little by little.

As long as an ounce of power
remains in me, I shall help you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Using a Star Power requires
Star Energy. 

Would you like to listen while I
tell you how to use Star Powers
and Star Energy?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I suggest that you listen. It's
very important.
Do you want to listen?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

All right, if you say so.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Allow me to explain.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...listen carefully.
You must save the other Star
Spirits quickly!

If the seven of us come
together, we'll be able to bestow
upon you a Star Power called
the Star Beam.

The Star Beam is the only thing
that can counteract the Star
Rod that Bowser wields.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have to go back now...
back to Star Haven.

I must leave immediately.
But I'll always be watching you!

Save us all, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now, Mario.
This is your gauge for Star
Energy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
See? You can check to see how
much Star Energy you have.

See how there's a star on the
right side of the gauge? Each
star marks one unit of Star
Energy.

So, you have one unit now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Next, allow me to explain about
Star Powers.
First, let me tell you about
Refresh, all right?

This Power enables you to
restore five points of both HP
and FP at once.

Why don't you try out Refresh
right now?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
See? Both HP and FP have
recovered 5 points each.

You used one unit of Star
Energy, so you're empty now.

Watch your Star Energy gauge
carefully during battle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Usually, your partner's turn
would come next, and then
it would be your enemy's turn.

But we're just practicing now, 
so let's assume it's Mario's
turn again. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK. It's Mario's turn.

Now, pay attention to the Star
Energy gauge!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you notice that the amount
of Star Energy increased a
little bit?

Star Energy increases little by
little every time it comes around
to Mario's turn. 

Remember this, because it'll
become very important!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Next, I'm going to teach you
about another Star Power:
Focus.

Focus is a Star Power that 
enables you to increase Star
Energy a little more than usual
during a turn.

Right now, your Star Energy is
almost empty, even though you're
slowly refilling it.

All right, try the Star Power
Focus now. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you notice how much the
Star Energy increased?

Focus helps you increase your
Star Energy much more quickly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You should also remember that
you can replenish your Star
Energy by taking a nap at a
Toad House.

Well, that wraps up my
explanation!

I earnestly wish that you'll
make good use of these Star
Powers during battle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hold it right there, Mario!
I've been waiting for you!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I told you I'd be back! Now I'll
get my revenge!

Here it comes, baby!
Check this out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dwaaaahhhhhh!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! I'm talking to you!
I promise you, this fight will be
much different from before!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey...you're Jr. Troopa!
Are you following us?
You need to mellow out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who is this crazed guy?
What a nut... 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who's this kid...?
Let me get this straight...
He wants to challenge you?
He's got to be kidding!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shut up!!!!!

You! Mario!!
Of course you remember me!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

That's right! Darn tootin'!
I'm Jr.Troopa!

This time, you're really gonna
see some fireworks!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Whaaaat! Darn it!
You don't remember me?!

Listen, you...you big lug!
My name is Jr. Troopa!
Remember it and tremble!

After this beating, you'll
definitely remember it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Get ready to hurt, Mario!
I'm gonna show you a new skill I
just picked up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah! Check that out!
You've never seen anything like
it before, have you? 

Your attacks are useless now!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeeowch!!
Who knew that Mario had such
battle skills?

Grrr...it's not over yet, though!
Yaaaaaaaahhh!!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you in the hat! Wait!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's fine weather, isn't it?
My name is Kent C. Koopa.
Please remember it, OK?

If you want to use this road,
you need to pay me 100 coins.
So sorry, but that's how it is.
You don't pay, you don't pass.

Coins make the world go round.
It's all about the money!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You want to fight? You're nuts!
Look at me! I'll cream you!

Because, to be frank, I'm very,
very, very strong.
Are you sure you want to fight?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, you don't have any coins?
Then you can't go through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bring some coins next time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Then you can't go through here.
Tough luck. Take off.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you changed your mind, and
now you'll pay the coins?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good doing business with you!
Oh, the jingle of coins is so very
beautiful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here, go ahead.
See you again sometime!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well, I have no choice...
I warned you, though.
This may hurt a little bit...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow. You must be really strong.
I mean, beating a guy my size?

I guess I have to give up.
See you later...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mt. Rugged!
Mt. Rugged!

Passengers heading for Dry Dry
Desert or Dry Dry Outpost,
should proceed directly over Mt.
Rugged from this station.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We still have a little time before
our next departure.
Come back in a while.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, sir.
This train is bound for Toad
Town Station.

Are you coming aboard? 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All aboard for Toad Town!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The train's running again.
Phew. About time!
I can finally go back to Toad
Town.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you want to go to Dry Dry
Desert, you'll have to hike over
Mt. Rugged.

Follow the arrows on the
signboards so you don't get 
lost.

There are a lot of scary
creatures around here.
If you're not careful, you'll get
hurt in a big way.

If things are looking desperate,
you'd better run away really
fast. At least I would...

Somebody told me that Dry Dry
Ruins just rose from the sand!

No way! Do you believe it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Some people think trains are
pretty boring, but I don't.

One day, I'm gonna get on this
train right here and go to a
town far, far away.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I saw a creature called a
Whacka on Mt. Rugged!

It was extra cute!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That extra cute Whacka...
I haven't seen it lately. What
could have happened?
I'm a little worried.

Mario,
do you know anything about the
habits of the wild Whacka?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! Mt. Rugged Station!
We finally made it, girls!
Breathe that fresh air!

I've always wanted to see Dry
Dry Outpost and now we're
almost there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that some of the hiking
trails on Mt. Rugged are closed 
and that some dangerous
creatures are about.

How exciting! Danger!
We'll be all right, right?

Anything goes out here in the
wild world! Oh, I've never felt so
alive!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stop it with those stories!
You're giving me goosebumps!
Don't talk anymore! Let's just
bite the bullet and forge ahead!

We didn't come all the way from
Toad Town to turn back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... No... Confound it!
Where could it be...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!
Sorry, folks! Very sorry!

I was looking for something and
not watching where I was going.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What now?
Aren't you Mario?

Why, you are! You're THE Mario!
Hello there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The name's Parakarry.
I deliver letters.

Um...

I'm normally a letter-perfect
postman, but I'm having a bit of
trouble with a lost letter.

Wouldn't you know it--I dropped
it on Mt. Rugged and now I can't
find it...

If you happen to stumble upon a
letter anywhere around here,
please tell me, all right?
My job could depend on it!

I'll be searching this area
thoroughly for a while...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you find a letter lying around
somewhere, could you bring it to
me, please?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...? That... looks like the
letter I'm looking for...
My mistake, perhaps...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! That's the one!
Aw, thanks for finding it!
I'm so relieved.

Uh... Actually...
I'm also looking for two other
letters I may have lost.

It wasn't my fault, really! If
you find them, could you...?
Thank you so much.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm still looking for those two
missing letters...
If you help me find them, I'll be
very grateful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! There we go!
That's one of the ones I dropped
by accident!

Thanks so much! Really!

Of course, there's still one more 
letter left...
If at all possible, could you
please find it, too?

I'm really scouring this area
down here, but so far I haven't
had much luck...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
One more letter... Please, I
really need it!

I'll keep looking for it right
around here...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The last letter!
You found it!

Now I've got all the letters I've
lost...today.
Oh, thank you so much!

You're a lifesaver!
I wish there were some way I
could repay you for your help.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Actually... To be honest...
I haven't just lost letters on
Mt. Rugged...

I may have sort of dropped some
all over the Mushroom Kingdom
while I was flying.

Heh heh... yeah. You know, you're
good at finding letters.

Do you think you could keep an
eye out during your travels?

In return, I would offer you
whatever help I can.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I see. May I ask why not?
Please, Mario, I'm in a bind!
You'd really save my shell!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh... I understand.
I suppose I'm asking too much.
You're a big hero with big goals.

Sigh... I have to face the music.

Of course, if you change your
mind let me know.
I'll follow you in a heartbeat!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello again!
You changed your mind?

Can I go with you?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, praise the Stars!
I wasn't looking forward to
having to find those letters all
by myself, no sir.

I'll do my very best to help! You
shall not regret this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now! Onward! 

Oh, but hey...
By the way, if you want to
deliver a letter to someone, just
speak to that person.

I have to be next to you at the
time for it to work, though.
Keep it in mind, all right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...?
You're talking to me?

I don't see anyone else here...
All right! You are talking to me!

It's been a long while since I
first came here from my home in
Flower Fields,

but you're still the very first
person to speak a word to me.

Nobody ever notices me.
The few people I actually see
just think I'm blooming.

I love a good conversation!
Here, take this as thanks!
This is a precious Seed.
Keep it well and remember me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please grow my Seed with care.
It'll help you one day...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know what makes me happy?
When folks see me and smile. 

That's every flower's dream.
Every flower's hope.
Every flower's...life.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, there are lots of my
fellow Bub-ulbs living throughout
the Mushroom Kingdom.

If you run into any of them, be
sure to stop and chat a bit.
They'll be delighted.

Are you taking a trip around the
world or something?
Traveling's fun, I guess.

Not for me, though. Nuh-uh.
I've decided to stay right here
forever and ever.

Whaaack-hoo! I'm Whacka!!
Just another picture-perfect
day atop Mt. Rugged! Wooo!

The sunshine! The fresh air! So
refreshing, whack-a-do!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whaaack-hoo! I'm Whacka!!
Just another picture-perfect
day atop Mt. Rugged! Wooo!

Of course, yesterday was also
pretty nice! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whaaack-hoo! I'm Whacka!!
Another lovely day! Hoo!

Tomorrow will be beautiful, and
the day after, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whack-huh-ooo?
I'm Whacka... Aren't I?

I feel like I'm getting a touch
forgetful nowadays.
Did I remember to eat breakfast
this morning?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whack-hoo, yack-a-doo...
Whick wick wack... Aah-hooo...♪
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whack-OW!
Don't hit me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whack-a-bYAAARGH!
Quit it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whack-OOOG!
That really hurts!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whack-a-waaaaaaaaa....
I can't take this abuse!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey there!
Hold up a sec, pardner!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Jest a dern minute...
I've seen you somewhere...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yep, verrrry similar!

You look a lot like this feller
Mario who's on Bowser's wanted
poster...

Now give!
What's yer name?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Marioooo!? Well, I'll be!

If yer Mario, I reckon I've got
to bust you up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm... Well...
Luigi, eh, pard...?
You do look like this dude...

Well, yer not Mario, I guess.
I reckon you can pass.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's that?!
Princess Peach!?

You take me fer a fool?
Princess Peach is captured up
there in Bowser's Castle!

You reckon I don't know that?

Yer askin' fer it, you big fibber!
I'm thinkin' yer Mario!
Prepare fer yer whuppin'!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yow! I got whupped!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, hello there, old boy!
How goes the travels, eh?

I'm known as Kolorado. I'm an
archaeologist, you know. I travel
the world.

At the moment I'm turning Dry
Dry Desert upside down to find
the Dry Dry Ruins.

My assistants have attempted
to gather information in Dry Dry
Outpost, which is near here.

Sadly, as of yet, we're having
little success. All I need's a clue
and we'll be golden!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, how goes it, old man?
I'm still neck deep in this
blasted Dry Dry Ruins search.

We at least have a lead now.
According to the locals in Dry
Dry Outpost,

there's an information trader
named Sheek somewhere in Dry
Dry Outpost. Apparently this
chap knows the desert well.

Of course, he's proving rather
difficult to track down.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, old bean, gossip can be
one of the most vital resources
for archaeologists.

Without fail! That's why I must
see this Sheek character as
soon as possible.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, old boy.
Doing well, I trust?

It's barely a morsel, but I
finally got a bit of news about
Dry Dry Ruins.

This fellow from Dry Dry Outpost
claims that another bloke named
Moustafa knows where the Dry
Dry Ruins are.

Tragically, only his followers
know where Moustafa is.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What kind of chap do you think
this Moustafa is?
Hmm... I simply must see him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello there, old chum!
How are you holding up in this
blasted heat, eh?

...Hm? Oh, yes, of course!
Well, this Moustafa who knows
where the Dry Dry Ruins lie...

Supposedly, this information
trader by the name of Sheek
knows something about him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But I tell you, old boy, I'm
having a devil of a time getting
Sheek to speak!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, time and again my mind
returns to the image of the
ruins hiding in the desert.

It haunts me... I can't sleep!

I am, quite simply, destined to
be the one to find them!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, what ill luck! No clues about
the ruins!

I'm getting so frustrated I just
might have to give up the
excavation for now...
How very sad...

I say...?

Mario,
that artifact you hold in your
hand...

It looks like...
It looks quite important!

Do my eyes deceive me, or is
that a clue to Dry Dry Ruins?

Mario! Old chum! I beg of you!
Could you possibly part with it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hmmm... Hmmm...
Are you quite sure?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, bother.
Well, I can't force you.
I'll just suffer...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,

if you could see to it to have a
change of heart, please give me
that artifact!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Cheers, Mario!
Smashing, really, old boy!

Soon now, the mysterious Dry
Dry Ruins will rise from the
sands that conceal them!

As a brilliant archaeologist, I
say it must be so!

I suppose a thank-you gift is in
order, eh, old boy?
Here you go, then!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You now know a bit of the magic
of the desert.
Cherish the memory, old boy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Archaeology is about mystery.
And you know, without mystery
life is rather bland, hm?

Maybe you should write this
stuff down, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!? Whoa!
You're Professor Kolorado!!

It's Kooper! I live next to you! 
It's so great to see you! I
never would've expected to meet
up with you out here!

I'm right in the middle of an
expedition with Mario. I wanna be
an archaeologist like you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello there, Kooper.
It's been ages!

So... If you're serious about
taking up archaeology, you and I
should go exploring someday.

Anytime, really!

...For now, you concentrate on
your adventure with Mario.

You'll never attain such fame in
archaeology as I have if you
don't finish one task before
starting the next.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! OK!

As soon as we're done saving the
princess and Mushroom Kingdom
and everything, you and I'll go
exploring!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Kolorado, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered. 
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, good show!
It's a letter from my wife.

Thank you ever so, old chap.
This is just what I needed to
give me strength to go on.

...I know!
I'll pass this along as a spot of
thanks.

I came across it while I was
immersed in the dig around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're assisting Prof. Kolorado.

Right now we're waiting on the
guy who hiked over to Dry Dry
Outpost to try to bring back
some information.

Did you know the people of Dry
Dry Outpost are descendants of
the makers of Dry Dry Ruins?

What a cool thought, huh? People
have been living here, watching
over the ruins for many
generations.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Professor Kolorado told me to
look everywhere for clues about
Dry Dry Ruins,

but I'm a little nervous 'cause I
haven't found anything yet.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow, the Professor's really
excited now that he found a clue
to Dry Dry Ruins.

He's starting a full exploration
immediately!

Finally, our research is starting
to move forward!
Maybe it'll be less boring...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To get to the desert town, Dry
Dry Outpost, just go due east
on this path.

I'd be careful not to stray from
the path if I were you. You may
find some trouble, and you'll
definitely get lost.

Even the path isn't that safe,
so watch out for enemies.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Researching these ruins is
incredibly difficult.

Everyone on the dig is completely
exhausted.

Sometimes I wonder whether Dry
Dry Ruins is really hidden there
or just a local myth.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We found a clue! Yeah! I'm
motivated again!

We're gonna find those ruins!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, fellow travelers.
I'm in the middle of a journey,
just as you appear to be.

Other travelers I meet are like
brothers and sisters to me.

If a town is what you seek,
follow this path to the east.
A desert town called Dry Dry
Outpost waits at path's end.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Go straight east on this path
to reach Dry Dry Outpost, a
desert town.

I'm having a rest in the shade.
Rule #1 when traveling through a
desert: never hurry.

Deserts, especially this desert,
are vast and confusing, and if
you wander too far afield you'll
definitely get lost. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, fellow travelers.
I'm in the middle of a journey,
just as you appear to be.

If you go southeast from here,
you'll reach a beautiful desert
oasis where lemon and lime trees
grow.

It's nice and cool.
It's really the best place to
have a rest, but many enemies
plague the surrounding area.

If you plan on reaching the oasis
in one piece, be careful.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I recently saw a billow of smoke
over the northern part of the
desert.

There was a big thud, as well.
I wonder what it was.

Hm?
Do you have any idea?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Traveling Nomadimouse, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered. 
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A letter to me? From Moustafa?
I've heard the name, but...
I can't remember who he is.

Anyway, thank you for delivering
it.
I'm surprised that you found me
way out here.

It's extremely hot traveling in
the desert, so take care.

Oh yeah!
Take this as my thanks!

Don't hesitate. Please take it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome, travelers! You must
have had a long, hot journey
getting here.
Welcome to Dry Dry Outpost.

Moustafa is the leader of this
entire town, so...
You'd better keep it in mind.

...Although you probably won't
ever see him...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's no question that Mr.
Moustafa is the boss of Dry Dry
Outpost, but...

it's incredibly rare for him to
actually be seen in public.
His personality is a mystery.
He's surrounded by secrets.

Even so, as long as you behave
yourself he won't mess with you.
He's not a tyrant or anything.

Please enjoy yourself during
your stay at Dry Dry Outpost.

Please enjoy Dry Dry Outpost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Master Mr. Moustafa is the main
man, yeah!♪ Master Mr.
Moustafa is the main man, ooh!♪

Where's the man? No one knows!♪
He stays hidden from his foes♪

Dry Dry Desert is a desert,
very dry♪
Winds of change blow sand in
your eyes♪

...Oh yeeeeah. That's right!
Don't I rock?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm out of new songs.

I can't sing a song some
composer wrote, either.
I have to rock in my own style!

I made a wish to the Stars that
I'd be inspired to write a
ripping tune but so far, zilch.
Nothing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Guess what! Hey!
Somewhere in the desert, there's
a stone cactus.

If you move 3 south and 2 west
from there, you'll find something
special hidden.

I'm not sure how to find it
exactly, however.
You should go there, huh? Yeah!

Hey! Wanna hear something else?
I know lots of other stuff!
Useful stuff! Hey!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Did you know?
The desert is dangerous!

If you get caught in a desert
whirlwind, it'll blow you away and
you'll get lost.

Bandits are out there, too! They
appear all of a sudden running
really fast, and they steal
people's coins!

There are many tales. You'd
better pay attention to them,
too, because the desert is an
unforgiving place.

Hey! Wanna hear more?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Guess what?
Here's something not a whole lot
of people know.

If you go south just after you
leave town, you'll find an oasis.
It's amazing... A paradise!

I go there sometimes.
If you want to take a rest, it's
the best place to go.

Wanna hear something else?
You'll be sorry if you don't! I
know lots of stuff! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Know what I heard?
There are these three trees
growing in a triangle somewhere
in the desert.

The rumor is that if you jump in
the center of the triangle, you'll
find something good.

Only... I don't know where the
three trees are...
I mean, the desert is huge! I
can't know everything...

Hey! You wanna hear something
else or what?
I'm loaded with tons and tons of
useful information!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you from Toad Town?
Wow, that's a ways away!

Dry Dry Ruins?
...Nope, never heard of it.
It sounds like a local fairy tale
or something.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, if you're serious about
looking for Dry Dry whatever,
you should go and ask the
information trader.

Supposedly this information
trader lives in town and swaps
information for items. Or
something along those lines.

...That's what my friend says.

My friend? This guy? Nah, he's
way too shy to be an information
trader.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My friend is the shyest guy.

He can't talk to strangers at
all. He just clams up.

That's why I usually talk for him,
you see.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's that, buddy?
You want to see the princess?
Whuh-ho! That's a toughie!

For that wish to be granted,
I think you'd better wish to the
Stars, buddy.

Hey, you travelers!
Am I right or am I right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My quiet friend here just adores
Princess Peach.

He's making a wish to the Stars
to meet her,

but I'm thinking he needs to deal
with some issues before that can
happen.

As he is now, if he meets the
princess, he won't be able to
speak a word!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
☆○×☆×○!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
See... Look at this guy...
He's only imagining seeing her
and he's completely wigging out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, someone said you're on a
quest to save Princess Peach!

I never even realized that you
were Mario! Imagine that!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
Ahem... Good luck.

Please save Princess Peach.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
.......!

Buddy! You spoke out loud!
It's a miracle! Whoopee!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Excuse me...
Can I talk to you for a sec?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What exactly are you doing
walking around that tree?
You're making me dizzy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What? You're joking.
You believe some crazy dream?

Well, OK... I guess...

I mean, I got a message in a
dream a long time ago but it
didn't mean anything.

It said, "There's a house with a
whirling roof in a large town
near a castle.

If you Spin Jump three times
inside the house, something good
should happen to you..."

Ha ha ha...
A house with a whirling roof! As
if that existed! Ha!

I don't take dreams seriously.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I remember the message that
came to me in a dream:

"There's a house with a whirling
roof in a large town near a
castle.

If you Spin Jump three times
inside the house, something good
should happen to you..."

A house with a whirling roof! Like
that existed! Ha!

Like I always say, you should
never believe what you dream.

Mm? Are you addressing me?

It's my fondest wish!

I want to compose Music filled
with beautiful Lyrics.
It's my fondest wish!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A composer, yes that's me♪
I write songs, as you can see♪

Wind in the desert, some old
rock♪ Free mind sister♪

uh...singing blister♪ La de dah
di...♪

I'm terrific at writing Music, but
I think perhaps I'm not so good
at writing Lyrics.

Hummahumma♪ Chuchuchuuu♪
Wheee-oooo♪

I like making songs up as I go
along.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mm? What's this, then?

Well...
... Un-huh...
Fantastic... These are incredible
Lyrics.

The wording is simple,
yet whoever wrote them packed
them with powerful feeling.

It's been a long time since I was
moved by something so deeply.

They move me so much, I just
thought of beautiful Music to
accompany them.
Wait just a second...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew...
I've written the perfect Music
for these Lyrics.

I caution you, though, that this
Music can be sung only by an
expert.

I know of no one up to the task.
Here, take my masterpiece!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder if there's anyone with
a voice pure enough to sing my
soothing Music.
My heart leaps at the thought!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mm?
You don't have my soothing Music
anymore?

But that means...
You found a singer who could sing
the song?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh. I see.
What a beautiful story! I weep
with joy!

Ohh!?
I've been struck by my musical
muse yet again!

To Toad Town I shall go♪
to catch this Diva's show!♪

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What ho!
Buying a Dusty Hammer after a
Dried Shroom... 

...is a secret sign that only
friends of Mr. Moustafa know!
... That means...
You're in with Moustafa!

Hey! Brother!
Good to meet you! Have any
questions you need answered?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...You want to see Mr. Moustafa?

He's usually up on the highest
part of Dry Dry Outpost.
Just keep going up, my man!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're the owner of this shop,
correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered. 
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, this is an order sheet
from one of my regulars.

Good deal.
She's one of my best customers.
She orders things all the time.

If health and beauty are what
you're after, you can't beat
desert Lemons and Limes.

You can find them in the oasis.
Oh, if you make a juice with
those things... Mmmm mmm!

Oh, hang on. Almost forgot.
Can you do me a favor?

Please deliver this letter to a
Boo called Franky.

Franky lives in a mansion way
out on the far edge of Forever
Forest. It may be tough to find
him.

Thanks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What ho!
Buying goods in that order...

is a secret sign! It was written
in an ancient will!

In keeping with the will,
I'm required to give you this.

Please take it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is sure different from our
jobs at the castle!

We came all the way here to look
for mystery and excitement and
adventure!

But it's too hot.
I feel like I'm drying up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Quiet, girl! The heat of the
desert isn't anything compared
to our passion for adventure!

As long as we stick together, we
can take anything!
We can go from one end of the
Mushroom Kingdom to the other!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've bought many rare goods
here at Dry Dry Outpost.

And later we're totally stopping
at the legendary Dry Dry Ruins.
We're gonna be filled with stories
when we get back home!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that an archaeologist
named Kolorado is around here
looking for Dry Dry Ruins.

You know what? Even if he digs
up the entire desert, he won't
find them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A word to the wise:
The owner of the local shop is a
friend of Moustafa.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I love this town. I don't care
that the desert's so harsh.

There's no place like home.
I was born in Dry Dry Outpost,
and this is where I'll stay!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I haven't seen rain in ages.

I know it's a desert, but it
should rain once in a while.

We made a wish to the Stars for
a little moisture, but I guess it
didn't help.

If this weather continues, it'll
get...dry...around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Mr. E, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered. 
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gee, thanks!
Oh, looks like an order from
Koopa Village.

My job is delivering things from
Dry Dry Outpost.

This guy's a great customer.
He's always ordering stuff.

Hey, by the way. Would you do me
a favor and deliver this letter
the next time you're in Toad
Town?

It's to Miss T. She lives there.
She's one of three amazingly
beautiful sisters.

She's normally chatting with her
sisters in front of the Dojo.
Thanks a lot!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you aware that there's a
Dojo in Toad Town? There is!

A while ago I took one of the
Dojo challenges and did pretty
well, I must say. I got a
Second-Degree Card.

You look pretty strong, so...
Huh?
You haven't earned any Cards?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sayyyyy... Is that...
...a First-Degree Card?

Hee hee! It just so happens,
that I have in my possession a
Second-Degree Card!

Know what that means?
I'm stronger than Mario! Yeah!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sayyyyy... Is that...
...a Second-Degree Card?

Hey, I have a Second-Degree
Card, too!

Oh, awesome! I can't believe
that I'm as strong as you are,
Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sayyyyy... Is that...
...a Third-Degree Card?

Whooa! That's great!
Seriously, that's great, Mario.
You must be a powerhouse!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sayyyyy... Is that...
...a Fourth-Degree Card?

Whooa!
I wouldn't want to tangle with
you, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sayyyyy... Is that...
...a Diploma...!?

Whoa! WHOOOAAA!
You defeated The Master!!

That's unbelievable, Mario!
Great! Seriously great!
I mean, really great!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you seen the old fortune-
teller in Toad Town?

He's always right, so his
fortune-telling is famous.

If you hit trouble in the middle
of your adventure, it'd be a
good idea to see him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A brother and sister who are
very close live atop Shooting
Star Summit.

The brother, Merlow, collects
Star Pieces and will trade
Badges for them.

The sister, Merluvee, is a
fortune-teller who will tell you
where to find Badges.

Dry Dry Outpost was built by
robbers long ago, you know. The
boss of the robbers was the
descendant of a king.

The king hid the entrance to the
ruins of his kingdom, and the
robber boss guarded them.

Legend has it that even now, the
descendant of that boss hides
in this town and keeps the ruins
safe from prying eyes.

People are saying that the ruins
that were hidden long ago have
appeared in Dry Dry Desert.

Amazing. That means that the
legend about the boss of the
robbers in the desert was...
...actually true.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I took the train to Toad Town.

I can't tell you how many things
were different there from here
in the desert.

The people were so different
and...just plain weird.

Keep this quiet...

If this woman casts a spell on

For instance, your attack power

Other, stranger, things may

But do not rely on this spell. By

The spell can be beneficial, but

Long ago, in this very land,
there was a kingdom called Dry
Dry Kingdom. 
King Mousta ruled over it.

One dark day, he was betrayed
by his subjects.
In the uprising that followed,
Dry Dry Kingdom was ruined.

King Mousta escaped and vowed
vengeance on his enemies.
He gathered those faithful to
him and defeated his betrayers. 

King Mousta's supporters were
the original robbers who built Dry
Dry Outpost.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
One of the descendants of King
Mousta still lives here in Dry
Dry Outpost.

No one knows who he is, but...

You can be sure that everyone
secretly wishes to be that one
special person...

It would be pretty cool to be
related to the great robbers of
yesteryear.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those rebels who rose up against
King Mousta... Do you know what
they wanted?

They wanted to live without rules
in the desert and use all the
treasures of Dry Dry Kingdom as
their own.

The great King Mousta had no
patience for such selfishness.

Because he had such high ideals,
King Mousta is the hero of this
outpost to this day.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, hello.

I'm assisting an archaeologist,
Professor Kolorado. 

I came to Dry Dry Desert to 
excavate Dry Dry Ruins, but...

It's hot as blazes every day and
I'm constantly thirsty...
I want to quit and go home.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was sent here because we
heard that there's an important
clue about the ruins, but...

I can't find the information
trader anywhere. It's vital that
I find him so I can get the clue.

I don't want to think about how
mad the professor will be if I
go back with nothing.
What am I going to do?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, hello, Mario.
At least I've found some news.
Supposedly, this guy Moustafa
knows the key to Dry Dry Ruins.

And then there's this other guy
named Sheek who knows where
Moustafa is, but...

That Sheek guy is really stingy
and won't tell me anything.

Why do people in this town like
mysteries and secrets so much?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody just said that the
ruins rose from the desert!
Can it be true?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Someone who gives things is nice,
yes, very nice.
Nice guys get told nice stuff.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! You give me something!
You might be nice.

If you're a very nice guy, you'll
give me something more.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well, good-bye.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Someone who hesitates when
giving things is not truly a nice
guy, no, not nice.

Truly nice guys give truly
precious things, yes.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You have nothing to give.
Then I have nothing to say.
Maybe another time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You give me many things.
Very nice guy, yes, very nice.

My name is Sheek.
I trade in information, things
others do not know.

So, nice guy...
...what would you like to know?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I thank you for giving things.
To show I am truly thankful,
allow me to tell you something.
What would you like to know?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, heavenly! A Lemon!!
The nicest of nice things!

You have proven you're nice by
giving me my favorite thing.

And since you're so nice, yes, I'll
tell you something really nice.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You are obviously the nicest of
nice guys...
...but you haven't let me repay
the favor.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Dry Dry Desert is a vast and
everlasting sea of sand.

Under this sea, many secrets lie
buried. More secrets than there
are Stars in the sky.

The legend of Dry Dry Ruins is
one of these secrets.

Only Mr. Moustafa knows where
the legend rests.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You must see Mr. Moustafa to
find the resting place of Dry
Dry Ruins.

Mr. Moustafa is a descendant of
the great robbers who built Dry
Dry Outpost.

He is somewhere in the town,
yes...but exactly where, only his
close followers know.

I could tell his secret, but only
to the nicest of nice guys, yes.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

My favorite food starts with an
L and ends with an N. It's a
yellow fruit...so sour.

Such a nice fragrance...
Its tree grows only in the
desert oasis outside town.

If you were to go to the oasis
and get one for me, I might
believe you're a true nice guy.

For, of course, only the nicest
of nice guys can meet Moustafa.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

If you still seek knowledge, you
must give me something more,
yes, you understand?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

To find Mr. Moustafa, go to the
shop in this town.

First buy a Dried Shroom. Then
buy a Dusty Hammer.

You must buy them in the correct
order, yes? Remember, Dried
Shroom first and then Dusty
Hammer.

This is a secret sign known to
those loyal to Moustafa.

If you buy these things in the
correct order,
the owner of the shop will let you
see Mr. Moustafa.

Remember, you must not buy them
in the incorrect order!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wish you luck in finding Mr.
Moustafa, nice guy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, nice guy. We meet again.
I'm glad you found me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm Moustafa.
I'm the one you've been seeking
all this time.

When I'm out and about in Dry
Dry Outpost, I use the name
Sheek.

It's always good to meet a
genuinely nice guy.

I meet people all the time, but
you are by far the nicest guy
I've met so far.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How did you get here?
Who told you how to find this
place?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Yes, Moustafa is my name.

When I'm out and about in Dry
Dry Outpost, I use the name
Sheek.

You look nice enough. I'm a good
judge of character.
I've been watching you ever
since you came to town.

I still can't believe you found me
without being told.
I think you must have extremely
good luck, yes?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your name is Mario, yes?
I heard that you want to go to
Dry Dry Ruins.

I have a feeling you are on an
important journey, so I will tell
you the secret.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dry Dry Ruins is a very
important place. My ancestors
have watched over it for many
generations.

If I do not keep evil folk out of
the ruins, who will?

You must promise me that you will
tell no one this secret!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll give you this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Pulse Stone is the key to
finding Dry Dry Ruins.

Take it to the desert, yes?

The Pulse Stone will flash above
your head as you get close to
the ruins.

The closer you get to the ruins,
the faster the Pulse Stone will
flash.
Follow where it leads you!

Find the place where the Pulse
Stone flashes the fastest and
use it to open the way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The closer you get to the ruins,
the faster the Pulse Stone will
flash.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you find Dry Dry Ruins?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How were Dry Dry Ruins?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!? It cannot be!
Followers of that evil Bowser had
already entered the ruins?

...Oh... You scared them off!

Mario, you have earned the
eternal thanks of Moustafa.

You are as nice as nice gets. I
wish you great success!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please return to Dry Dry
Outpost when you have time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome, Mario.
Do you need anything of me?

It's obvious you've attained
great power.
It's clear to me you will be
victorious one day.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Toad House slogan is, 
"Refresh your Body and Soul!"

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Uh, are you sure?
You look fine to me.
Would you like to take a nap
anyway?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Pleasant dreams!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Good luck out there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, welcome, how are you?
Feeling jolly? Feeling blue?

I'm Merlee, you see? That's me!
A cuter gal you'll never see. I do
magic, but not for free.

Your luck has steered you well
for I'm a master of the spell.

When my spell upon you glows
you might get lucky, but who
knows?

Do you dare to take a chance?
Want to watch my cards dance?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, how tragic, what a loss!
Well, I guess you are the boss.

Bye bye! Don't forget to floss!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, how lovely! Very good!
Pick just one now, if you would.♥

I'd pay as much as I could...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh! Of coins you lack a few.
What a pity. Oh boo hoo!

Come again some other day. 
Bye bye! Come back soon, OK?♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well, we're ready! Tally-ho!
And here we go!♥ 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think you'll find this power
might get your foes to cower.♥
It will light your darkest hour.

Even should you meet a beast...
Do not fear! Not in the least!♥
My spell makes a famine feast.

See you, then.
Please come again. Good-bye, my
friend!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My older sister? Merluvlee?
What's she want? Oh, I see...
Is that so...?

I bet I know...... oh...ho....
OK, OK.

Please give this to Merluvlee,
with love, from her sis Merlee.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleeag, Blooooaaaagh!!

I'm the huge, scary Tutankoopa!
Remorseless king of the desert!

Who dares set foot in this, my
palace of the sands?
Speak and be known!

Begone from this place! Now!
Or disaster will befall you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Fool! You have ignored my
warning, haven't you?
You fool!

You will fall to my legions and
become a mummy of the sands!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...? Wait!
C'mon, don't go in that room!

... Ooops. Ahem! I mean...

Flee now while you still can!
If you continue...uh...you'll feel
a horrible curse!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Turn back, thief!
Your time is running out!

If you do not retreat, you'll be
in grave trouble!

I do not lie!
You will regret it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is your final warning!
Enough of this foolishness! Leave
at once!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleah heh heh heh ...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You!!
You ignored all those very scary
warnings!

Don't you have the common sense
to get scared and run away?
What's wrong with you!?

You shouldn't mess with
Tutankoopa, a faithful follower
of King Bowser!

Ooops... I mean...

You shall regret this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch!
What are you doing? That hurt!

I'm king of the desert!
You rude, rude man!
Take this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleah heh heh heh...

I'm a magical genius!
Watch, and be amazed!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleah heh heh heh...

Come, Chomp! Come!
Bite this intruder!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come!! Chomp!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooooooooooooooooooo!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw...
C'mere, Chompy...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waah! What're you...ow! Help!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you, Mario.
At last I can head home to Star
Haven.

My name is Mamar.
So nice to meet you in person!♥

You've still got a long way to go,
but I just know you can save
Princess Peach!

I'll do my best to help you!♥
Here's a present for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Call on me when times are bad.
Believe in this, Mario: My powers
are strong...
I'm a Star Spirit, after all!♥

Hm hm hm... Our powers are
growing all the time.
Keep up the good work, Mario!

You must save the other Star
Spirits as soon as possible!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
For now, I'm going back to
recover in Star Haven.

Who knows how my dear old Star
Haven is faring without the Star
Rod? 

Good-bye, Mario!
I'm off!♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aargh!
No more time!

Too bad!! Please try again next
time.

See you at the next trading
event, all right?
So long!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello! I'm the Toad from the
trading event. How are you?
Did you bring the item?

No?
You don't have anything?

Look, I can't trade with you
unless you bring the item I told
you to bring.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello! I'm the Toad from the
trading event. How are you?
Did you bring the item?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Congratulations!

This is the item for today!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Use it wisely!

See you again at the next
trading event!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wrong! Sorry.
That's not the right item.

As a penalty, I'm afraid I'll
have to take this item.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello?
You don't want the item?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pardon me, sir... Would you
happen to be Mario?
How do you do, sir?

My master wishes to see you.

If you would, please call on us
at the mansion on the far side
of Forever Forest.

My master would also like me to
add that she has in her
possession important news
regarding the Star Spirits.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please make haste!
We shall await your arrival with
a warm welcome.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And if you don't come...we'll GET
YOU!! BOOO!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm...
What do you think you're doing?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Forever Forest...
The path ahead of here is
extremely dangerous.

Didn't you know that? You'd
better go back.

This forest is my home.

I try to keep unprepared people
from wandering into the forest
and getting lost.

The path ahead of here is
extremely dangerous.
Didn't you know that? You'd
better go back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Um-kay. So that's your story.
You're invited to Boo's Mansion.

You may pass, then.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen carefully...

If you want to get through this
forest, you have to pay really
close attention to your
surroundings.

If you choose the wrong paths,
you'll end up back at the forest
edge before you know it.

The areas around the correct
paths will always look slightly
different from the others.
Watch carefully for clues.

For example, in this area, take a
good look at the inner trees as
you walk around.

In one of them, you'll spot
strange, glowing eyes.
The exit near that tree is the
path you want to take.

These clues will be different in
other parts of the forest.
Watch the inner forest very,
very carefully as you go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen carefully...
If you want to get through this
forest, you have to pick all the
right paths.

If you choose the wrong paths,
you'll end up back at the forest
edge before you know it.

You can find your way as long as
you keep your wits about you
and study the forest.

But remember that the right way
is not always in front of you.
On occasion, you must remember
to look back, as well.

You probably think that this
forest is unpleasant, but
it's always been home to me, and
I think it's just perfect.

The forest teems with life and
tells many secrets.

Even as many Stars cry out in
the distance...

...my friends cry out deep within
this forest.

Heey! Hello there!

I'm a Bub-ulb from the land
called Flower Fields.

...A flower seed?

Heh heh hm hmmf...
Should I give it to you...?
Or shouldn't I?

Welllll....
I suppose I'll give it to you.
Here you go.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please plant it somewhere nice
and take extra good care of it.

If you plant it somewhere bad
and I find out about it, I might
place a curse on you...
Heh heh ho hm hm hmmf...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you lose your way here in
Forever Forest, it means you're
not looking carefully enough.

I know... It's often confusing.
It's not an easy task.

It takes guts to look really
closely at this scary scenery.

I miss my beautiful hometown,

Oh! That warm sunshine spilling

the sweet smell of wind...

This is my home now.

Hey, when you listen really
carefully, can you hear the
voices of the Stars above us?

I think I do...and I think they
can hear us, as well.

They listen for all the wishes of
folks down here.

I hope the Star Spirits make it
back to Star Haven before it's
too late.

This world won't be right again
until they're back where they
belong.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooooo! Waaahh!
Bugs! Get 'em off me!

I'm lost in a freaky forest!
S-s-so s-scared...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Eeeek!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
Oh, thank... ...I mean, ah HA!

Boy, are you unlucky to run into
me again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why, it's Jr. Troopa!
Have you been crying? Did you
get lost in there?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario.
It looks like this kid is lost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This little boy is filthy! What
happened to him?
Is he a lost child or something?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh dear. This poor child looks
very upset.
Was he lost in the forest?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who is this kid?
What a dirty little urchin...

He must be lost...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Shut up! Shut uuuuup!
I'm not a lost child!

I'm your worst nightmare!
Here comes the pain!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't think I'm as vulnerable as
I was before.

Check this out!
More power!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha ha! Yeah, that's right!
Let's see how you like the new,
improved Jr. Koopa!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooooo!
Darn it! Darn it!! Darn iiiiiit!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!
I made it out of the forest!
I could kiss this ground!

Yaaaaahoo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, we made it, Mario!
We got out of the forest!

It's about time... Say, don't you
think that's the mansion the old
Boo was talking about?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew! Well, it looks like we finally
made it out of that spooky
forest.

Heyyy... Mario...
What do you bet that's the
mansion that the old Boo was
talking about before?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, finally! 
I couldn't stand being in that
spooky forest another minute!

Hm? Mario!
I'm positive that's the mansion
the creepy old ghost was telling
us about...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh... I'm certainly glad we're
out of that forest.
Talk about creepy...

What's this? Mario, I have a
feeling that this is the mansion
we're looking for.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome, sirs and madam!
I'm pleased you made it through
Forever Forest.

My master awaits you in the room
highest up in this lovely mansion.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please go to the third floor.

There you will hear all the news
of the Star Spirits...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll see you there...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi! Did I startle you?
You want to go up to the third
floor, don't you?

Well, I'm afraid you'll have to go
find whatever's missing from this
frame.

If you manage to find it, I'll let
you go upstairs.
Mmwaah ha ha ha!

Bow is such a harsh Boo, testing
her guests like this...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Search the mansion for what's
missing from this frame.

If you find it, I'll let you up to
the third floor.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew... Ah, that feels better!
It's nice to be back inside my
frame after so long!

All right, then.
I'll help you go to the third
floor, OK?

Jump toward the drawing and I'll
take care of the rest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew... Ah, that feels better!
It's nice to be back inside my
frame after so long!

But I didn't even tell you to go
find the drawing! You solved the
riddle on your own!

Are you just lucky or what?
Mweh heh heh...
Maybe it's just a coincidence...

In any case, you've managed to
stumble on the secret way to the
upper floor.

Jump toward the drawing and I'll
take care of the rest.
You've earned your way up to
the third floor.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Say hello to Bow for me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Marioooooo... You have come...

If you want this record, you
must guess who holds it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Lady Bow will be very angry
if we let him get it too easily,
fellow Boos!

Do your best, like we practiced!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, hey, Boos and Boos! Who's
got it? Choose, choose!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooo! Boo hoo!

You...You guessed right. Go on,
take this.

Oh Boo...
Lady Bow's really going to flip
out on us...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hee hee hee hee...
Wrong!

This is so much fun...
Keep it up, Boos, or Lady Bow
will make us sorry!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I am so bored!! Boo-ored!

I know the Lady Bow ordered me
to stay here...
...but for how long?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I am so bored!! Boo-ored!

I know the Lady Bow ordered me
to stay here...
...but for how long?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh yeah, such rhythm!
What a groove! Par-tay!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh Boo!
Is that...the end?
I was just starting to bust out
my best dance moves.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Noooo...

Lady Bow gave me one job...to
guard that treasure chest.
She is gonna punish me so bad if
she finds out about this!

Oh...well... I may still be OK. Heh
heh heh heh...

It's not like you can get
anywhere without knowing how to
use that Weight.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Marioooo... Welcooooome...

If you want these Boots, you
must guess who holds them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Lady Bow will be very angry
if we let him get them too easily,
fellow Boos!

Do your best, like we practiced!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, hey, Boos and Boos! Who's
got 'em? Choose, choose!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooo! Boo hoo!

You...You guessed right. Go on,
take them.

Oh Boo...
Lady Bow's really going to flip
out on us...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hee hee hee hee...
Wrong!

This is so much fun...
Keep it up, Boos, or Lady Bow
will make us sorry!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's a hidden floor panel
very near here.
A Star Piece is underneath the
floor panel.

Press {A} while jumping.
Boo-st of luck! Can you find it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are hidden panels on the
ground all over Mushroom World,
so keep an eye out for them.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwah hee haha!


You've finally arrived!
You took your sweet time, huh?


I was testing you to see if you
live up to your reputation.
How were the tests? Tough?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My name is Bow.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm Bootler, the butler.

I'm Lady Bow's humble servant.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The reason I asked you here is
that I need a favor.

Bootler,
give him the rundown.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course, my lady.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
do you know the area near here
called Gusty Gulch?

A hill rises at the top of the
gulch, and upon it sits the
castle of Tubba Blubba.

He's a monster...and he eats...
...us! Ghosts!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boos are his favorite food. Many
friends have been eaten!

We've tried attacking the evil
fiend to save our friends,

but Tubba Blubba is far too
strong for us Boos to slow him
down even slightly.

He seems invincible.
That's why he's known as the
Invincible Tubba Blubba.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There is hope, however.

If the rumors are true, then
Tubba Blubba has a secret that
he closely guards.

And that secret is...
probably something that relates
to his weak point.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So, Mario,

I want you to find out his secret
and defeat him.

You'll do it, won't you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course, you'll get a reward
for doing us this service.

If you beat Tubba Blubba up, I'll
let you have this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmmm... Mario. I'm sorry we
must meet in such a dire
situation.

My name is Skolar.
I escaped from Tubba Blubba's
Castle, but... 

I was in quite a weakened state
when I made it outside.
As a result, I couldn't go back
to the sky at first.

I tried to head for Shooting
Star Summit to make the leap to
Star Haven, but I became lost in
the forest.

While hunting for a way out, I
was captured by Boos.
And now here I am...

I don't know what to say...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What do you think, Mario?
Not such a bad deal, is it?

You would have had to fight
Tubba Blubba to save this Star
Spirit anyway, right?

This way, you help us Boos, too.

Besides, I'm going with you. I'll
help you like no one else can.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...My lady?
What did you say just now?

You? At Tubba Blubba's Castle?
Quite out of the question!

I simply cannot allow you to put
yourself in such danger!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Still your tongue, Bootler!
I've seen too much suffering
caused by Tubba Blubba!

I wish to see him punished with
my own two eyes.

Besides, Mario will need me.
There's no way he can reach the
castle without my powers!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...alas... Then, Lady, I,
Bootler, will accompany you.

It is my sworn duty to see that
no harm befalls you. The
ancestors demand it!

I will be at your side always.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You stop that nonsense!

I'm not a child anymore!
I'll be fine by myself!

You wait here for my return.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
La... Lady...

Sigh...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is this all right, Mario?

I'll join up with you until we oust
Tubba Blubba.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, then!
Tubba Blubba's going down!

Gwaah ha haaa!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good... Good luck.
Please take care of our lady...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good sir,
please take care of our lady.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lady Bow,
please come back to us as soon
as possible.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hush up, Bootler!
You be quiet and take care of
the mansion while I'm gone!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sigh...sigh......
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dear sir...
Lady Bow is very, very, very
important to us Boos.

Please don't let her get in any
dangerous situations.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If harm befalls our lady,
the Boo ancestors will be horribly
displeased.

I shudder to ask this, but I
must beg you to protect her
whenever danger arises!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lady Bow told me not to sell any
items to Mario. You're him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Igor of Boo's Shop, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...no!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A letter?
Oh, right, an order list.

Weird. This order's from
...Gusty Gulch.
That's right around the corner!
Can't they just come here?

Oh, well. My motto is, "From Boo
to you with a smile."

Take this for your trouble.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This mansion has been passed
down through the years by Lady
Bow's ancestors.

It's so comfortable... So nice
and gloomy...
The dirt on the walls... The
splintered floorboards...

It's really one of a kind.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You beat Tubba Blubba!
I had nightmares about him.

But wasn't he invincible?
How'd you manage to beat him?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
please take care of Lady Bow!

She brings the darkness to our
lives!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Our lady is joining Mario to
defeat Tubba Blubba...

Such courage... Such brave
beauty...

You will need help to beat Tubba
Blubba, so please use the shop
beneath the mansion.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lady Bow is the very definition
of grace, beauty and dignity!

No other Boo could fill her shoes
as master of the mansion. If she
wore shoes, that is.

When I behold the lady, 
my heart goes pit-a-pat!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
While Lady Bow is absent, it's
our duty as Boos to keep
scaring people.

How would it look if the Boo
mansion stopped being spooky?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Franky, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank you!

... Oh, great, it's finally in!
This is from a guy I know who
deals in useful items from all
over the world.

He has a great eye for items.
He just got something in that
I've wanted for a long time.
Oh, it's the coolest thing!

Oh, wow, I almost forgot! Could
you deliver this for me?
Sorry if it's a bother...

There's a Toad child in Toad
Town named Dane T. Please
deliver it to him.

He always seems to be playing by
the station with his pals. He
must like trains.

Thanks a Boo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, what can I Boo for you?
An errand for Koopa Koot, huh?
Too bad for you.

Koopa Koot's been known to use
people, you know.

His motto is, "If it moves, use
it until it drops."

He got in a couple fights over his
personality way back when.
After one really bad one, he
started traveling a lot.

This is a photo of us from when
he passed through these parts.

Take this and say hello to Koopa
Koot for me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Go ahead, open it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So, Mario,
we're on our way.
Are you scared?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Lady Bow!
What a surprise, seeing you!

You know, Your Ladyship, you
really shouldn't come around
here. It's dangerous.

Tubba Blubba could come here at
any time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I know! I came here to teach
that Tubba Blubba a lesson!

Bring him on!
When was the last time he came
through here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why, just yesterday, Lady. It
was horrible...

He...ugh...
This time, he...ate Herbert. Oh,
it was gruesome!

Poor Herbert!
He was so dark and depressing!
What a terrific Boo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! Not Herbert!
Ooh, Tubba Blubba... He must be
stopped...

Listen, everyone! Don't fear!
We're on our way to defeat this
Tubba Blubba once and for all!

That monster has eaten his last
Boo-meal!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Lady!
Your bravery is inspiring!

But you know he's called the
Invincible Tubba Blubba...
Please be careful, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When you come across Tubba
Blubba, don't fight!
He's invincible!

Although somebody who claims
to have no weaknesses must have
at least one.

If you could find it somehow...

Windy Mill?
It's just over there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What! You're kidding!
You defeated Tubba Blubba!?
Oh, what a great day for Boos!
I knew you'd do it, Lady Bow!

Finally, we can exist safely.
We owe you a great debt.

...Oh, and I guess you folks
helped the lady a little bit.
Good work, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard from one of the Boos
eaten by Tubba Blubba that his 
belly was literally packed full of
ghosts for a while.

He never felt full, though. Of
course not. We're ghosts!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi, Mario. You're looking good, as
usual.

You'd need to be paler if you
want to be a proper ghost.

Take my face, for example. It
takes a lot of work, but look how
pale I am!

Whuh...?
You've seen paler?
Really...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Psst! Buddy!
Did you know you can walk slowly
and stealthily by moving the
Control Stick a little bit?

You can use this technique to
walk quietly and avoid waking
sleeping people.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tubba Blubba is coming!?
Oh no! Quick, hide! Aaagh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That naughty Boo that Tubba
Blubba ate came back!

It was so lonely around here
without him...
It really made me realize the
importance of friends.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That naughty Boo that Tubba
Blubba ate came back!

He was always a troublemaker,
but it was weird with him gone.

But now, everything's back to
normal again...
Thanks for saving him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Has my naughty friend played
any spooky tricks on you yet?

It'd be a shame if you came all
the way out to Gusty Gulch and
didn't get messed with...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hello.
You're running an errand for old
Koopa Koot, are you?

...Uh-oh... Now where did I...?

I wasn't really ready for this...
Where'd I leave that thing?
I'd better go look for it.

Um... Do you think you can wait
for just a second?

I should find it soon enough, so
why don't you kill some time by
wandering around here? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Can you wait a little while
longer? I'm still looking...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you for waiting!♥
I finally found it. I can't believe
it took me so long to track it
down!

Anyway, please give my regards
to Koopa Koot, OK?
And take care!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You've gotta watch out when you
fight Hyper Goombas.

They charge up their attack
power and then unleash it.

The best thing to do when they
get charged up is to get Outta
Sight with Lady Bow!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You what!? You discovered Tubba
Blubba's secret? And now he's
chasing you!?

Oh no... Oh... I've gotta hide
somewhere!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now that Tubba Blubba has
stopped eating everyone, the
forest is peaceful again.

Now we can return to our days
of scaring everyone who enters
the forest and playing delightful
pranks!

Pardon me?
No pranks?
... I'm not promising anything.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh. Mario, how's Lady Bow doing?

She's a fine, upstanding Boo and
is very delicate, so you be sure
to take care of her.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Excuse me, Mario?

Bleeeahhhhh!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oooh! Excellent!
What technique! What perfect
delivery!

There's always something new I
can learn from that guy. What a
Boo master!

I've got to work on my scaring
skills, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario,
have you saved all of the Star
Spirits yet?

I wonder why I care... I don't
even know if Star Spirits listen
to the wishes of ghosts.

I sure hope they do...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pardon me, Mario?

Broooaargh!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh yeah! Another score!
Boy, nobody scares people like
that Boo! Wow!

Such a flawless appearance! It
takes my breath away.

... Actually, if we're splitting
hairs, I'm a ghost so I don't
actually breathe.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I had a friend who escaped from
Tubba Blubba's Castle the other
day, and he said...

"The key to solving the secret is
inside the innermost room. Pay
attention to both the heart and
body, and don't..."

Then, just as he was finishing,
Tubba Blubba ate him.

I wonder what the rest of his
message was...

What? Whaaaaat? Tubba Blubba's
behind you?
Noooo! I don't wanna be eaten!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Peace has finally returned to
our hill.
Tubba Blubba's not going to eat
anybody anymore.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My friend came back!
I couldn't be happier!

Now it's time to get back to
scaring people senseless.
I can't wait...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now then...
What to do, what to do? Who
should I scare?

I want to hear people shriek and
watch them run away yelling!
That's what makes Boos happy.

So, if you could, when a Boo
scares you, try to be as
terrified as possible, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh. Hello. Boo, I guess.
Poor effort. Sorry. I had a
weird dream last night...
This dream voice said...

"Sometimes you must turn and
run away. You must run and run
until you reach the tower with
the spinning vanes."

Something like that, anyway.
What could it mean?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stanleeeeeeeey!!!
He ate Stanley! I can't believe I
just saw Stanley get eaten!

Oh, I'm gonna be sick...
Oh, cruel destiny! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
Some Boos just went to help you.
What happened to them?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All my friends who got eaten by
Tubba Blubba are back!

They've been telling me all these
crazy stories about being inside
Tubba Blubba's stomach...

What it was like to go rolling
down the throat into the belly...
Talk about a wild ride! And talk
about disgusting!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tubba Blubba ate up my dear,
lovely Victoria...but now she's
come back safely!

Victoria... So coy...
She's never even given me the
time of day...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...sweet Victoria...
Please give me a sign!

You're the object of my fondest
nightmares!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My friend escaped from Tubba
Blubba's Castle.

He claims that Tubba Blubba
hides something incredibly
important right next to his bed.

I wonder what it could be.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tubba Blubba sometimes travels
down to the foot of the hill.

I'm sure he's doing something
secretive down there, but...
...what could it be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Buhh... Uhhh...
Tubbba Bbblubbaa...ate...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Buh? Whuh? What?
Tubba Blubba's coming?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I swear, when I first saw my
friends who had been eaten by
Tubba Blubba return...

I was totally shocked. I felt like
I was seeing ghosts.

I'm just glad that everyone's
safe and sound again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boos are saying that Tubba
Blubba took off.
Phew! This area will once again
be a ghost paradise.

Not only that... Tubba Blubba
returned all the ghosts he'd
eaten!

And here we thought they were
gone for good.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everyone is so crazy about the
lovely Victoria.

But the way I hear it, she's
already got somebody specific in
mind.

Sigh... Love is so painful.
Not all wishes can be granted,
I suppose. How sad...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello there!
You're going up to beat Tubba
Blubba, right?

Yeah! Get revenge! He'll never
eat another ghost! Never!

Especially not...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Oh no!
Tubba Blubba's coming!
Everybody, hide!!

Lady Bow!
You have to hide Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You! Switch with me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! We have to hide!
Use my power! Immediately!
Press {▼}!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everything's cool, Lady!
He can't see you!
Nope, there's no way Tubba
Blubba can see you right now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Er...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmm...looks yummy!
I needed a snack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Urp...
A little tangy, but good.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!! Stanley!!

Oh, the horror of it all...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I never thought I'd be back in
dear old Gusty Gulch again.

I swear, when Tubba Blubba ate
me, I thought that was the end
for this Boo.

But now it looks like everything
might work out.
And now I've got a great story
to tell youngsters.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My dear Victoria has also come
back safe and sound.

I was desperate when she was
first eaten by Tubba Blubba,
that's for sure.

Now I'm by her side again...
What? You can't see her?
Ha ha ha... Of course not! She's
a ghost, Mario!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I finally made up my mind.
I'm going to confess my feelings
for the lovely Victoria.

But how to tell her...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

First, I figured I'd express my
feelings by giving her a present
like, you know... 

"Here's a Fire Flower to show
how hot the flame of my passion
burns."
or... 

"Are you shocked to know of my
love? Here's a Volt Shroom."
or...

... Gaaah!!
I can't decide!
Which line do you think would work
better?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh...OK. Thanks. I'll do it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...OK. Thanks. I'll do it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh
. . . Thanks for nothing...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Victoria loves me back!

We're going to get married when
Lady Bow returns here!

So...hurry up and come back as
soon as possible, OK? Seriously!
Soon!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Since Tubba Blubba left, this hill
seems so quiet.

It's almost like a... ghost town
or something.

Chilling and desolate...
Heh heh...♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm a ghost named Herbert.
Isn't that a great name?
My grandmother named me.

My ancestors lived in that
castle for many generations.
They were great ghosts.

I wanna be that great. I wanna
be so scary that no one will ever
forget me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, Tubba Blubba lived in
that castle for a while and was
perfectly nice. It was a great
place for ghosts, too.

So dim and dark... But then one
day he turned invincible and
started acting crazy.

He started eating all the Boos in
the castle! It was insane!

We had no choice but to flee or
be eaten...

Stanley! No!
Ah... Why you, too?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Windy Mill?
Just keep heading down along
the gulch.

You'll see it before you reach
the Boo mansion.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Until yesterday, it was just a
dream to have all the Boos living
together happily.

But it's not a dream now, is it!
Thanks to Lady Bow!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm really happy that all the
ghosts are back, but...

with so many of us around,
people might get used to us and
not get scared anymore.

That would be a tragedy, huh?
Maybe we'd better find a quiet
place with fewer ghosts so we're
not so conspicuous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems like fewer and fewer
people are getting lost and
coming around here recently.

I haven't even tried my new way
of terrifying people yet. I've
been practicing for ages.

Maybe I should start wishing to
the Stars for people to lose
their way more often. Then we'll
be in business.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi! You again!

Once Tubba Blubba's secret got
out, I became just an ordinary
key.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chilly out, isn't it?
Cold...and empty... Brrr!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know what I need? A new
secret to guard.

Except this time, I want to
guard some happy secret, like a
present or something.

Wouldn't that be the best?
Guarding a gift...
That's my new wish.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who are you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!?
Mario!?

Did someone...
...tell you that I'm the secret
strength of Tubba Blubba!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Someone spilled the beans that
the Tubba Blubba in the castle is
just a shell and...

...I'm controlling it from here!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can't trust anybody!

I can't let you out of here
knowing the secret of my
"invincible" body!

Sorry, but here we go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you! Lady ghost!
You look quite tasty.

Stick around after the battle.
Fighting makes me hungry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Blech! You wish!
You don't have a chance, you
ghost-gobbling freak!

Mario!
Now I'm really mad! Let's beat
this thing up!

Gwaah ha ha ha!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Heh heh heh heh...
I'm gonna do this great attack.
It's impossible to avoid.

I just have to prepare a bit, so
hang on for a second.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Owwwweeee!
Oh, I'm hurting!

I have to get out of here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's time to reunite!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh yeah! Now I'm feeling good!
With my heart and body united,
there's no way to beat me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Eeeeoooow!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Oh... Nooo!

With my heart and body united,
I'm not invincible anymore...

Now I'm back to "not invincible"
Tubba Blubba... That's so lame.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I give uuuup!
Look, I'll give back all the ghosts
I ate! Forgive me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm actually a really sensitive
guy trapped in a huge body.

I don't wanna be invincible
anymore if it means I have to
fight guys like you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaaa ha ha ha.


Serves you right!
And everyone who got eaten has
returned safely! Hooray!

...But I guess I'd better tell 
everyone not to scare old Tubba
Blubba anymore.

We used to love scaring Tubba
Blubba night and day because
he was such a coward.

Oh well. We're not sorry for it!
Scaring folks is what ghosts do,
so Boo on him... Ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Besides, that was a pretty
invigorating experience.
I've never felt so full of
excitement before!♥

And... Ahem... It was also a good
learning experience.

I think I'd better experience
some more of the outside world.

So... 
I think I'll accompany you a
little longer.

Is that OK, Mario?
Of course it's OK, right?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Done.

You're so lucky to be able to
travel with me.

Gweaah heh ha!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You don't have to be polite.

You won't have to worry about
anything anymore as long as I'm
with you.

Gweaah heh ha!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here you go, Mario. I'm giving you
back the Star Spirit, as I
promised.

Bootler! Snap to it! Come over
here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here, Mario. He's free now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello again, Mario.
I knew you could do it.
I don't know how to thank you.

I knew it was the right decision
to ask you to help us.
You're a great man.

Now that I'm free, I can help
you.

Ha!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... Mario.
I have one bit of bad news.

Unfortunately, Bowser's life
force seems to be getting
stronger all the time.

Most likely it's the Star Rod
that's giving him more power.

We're not even sure if he's
noticing it or not, but there's no
question that it's making him
stronger than before.

We will have to be much more
careful in the coming trials.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... I'm sorry to leave, but I
must go back to Star Haven.
The other Star Spirits are
waiting for me there.

Oh...and if you could... Please
keep it a secret that I got lost
in Forever Forest.

Thanks, Mario. Bye!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...If they catch you,
they'll carry you out of the
castle.

Don't you think you can hide from
them by using one of our party
member's abilities?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Can't we do something so these
things don't chuck us out of the
castle?

Doesn't anyone in our party have
an ability that'll help us avoid
them?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, they'll throw us out of the
castle if they catch us.

Can we use a party member's
ability so we don't get caught?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is not good. We'll be thrown
out of the castle when they
catch us.

Can't we get around these
creatures by using the ability of
one of our party members?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These things will try to catch us
and throw us out.

Use my ability to turn invisible
and we'll fool them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
At last, we've arrived at Tubba
Blubba's Castle!
Are you ready, everyone?

Be brave! We must do all we can
to help the Lady Bow!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But...what can we do?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is no time to lose our nerve,
fellow Boos!

Our dear lady is fighting
against Tubba Blubba himself! We
mustn't hesitate!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come back here!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wha... Wha... What's that noise?

Tubba Blubba's chasing you?!
And he's right on the other side
of the door?! Gulp!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!?
You might be able to find out
Tubba Blubba's weak point?

Oh, of course! The windmill at
the foot of the hill...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You must hurry! Run as fast as
you can to the Windy Mill!

We'll hold Tubba Blubba here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No! 
You'll all be eaten when he comes
through that door!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you nuts!
That Tubba Blubba will make a
meal out of you guys!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No, no! That's crazy!
If he gets through, he'll eat all
of you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can't agree to that!
You're all in grave peril of being
eaten! You must run with the
rest of us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's too dangerous!
He's a madman! He'll eat every
last one of you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grruuuurg!!
Why won't this door open?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I...don't know how long...we can...
keep holding this.

Don't worry about us! Go, for
all our sakes!
Don't look back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We can't hold it much longer!
Hurry to the Windy Mill!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! C'mon! We have to go to
the Windy Mill!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, we have to!
Let's go as fast as we can!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We have no choice, Mario!
Our only hope is to find Tubba
Blubba's weak point!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Make haste to the Windy Mill!
We can't let their brave efforts
be in vain!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Let's go, Mario!
We're going to the Windy Mill!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I smell delicious ghosts!
Open the doooooooor!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... You're Mario!
Nice place, huh?

As a matter of fact, I came to
this castle with my friends to
try to find Tubba Blubba's weak
point.

We managed to find out that
there's something important
hidden in Tubba Blubba's room on
the highest floor.

But once I got separated from
my friends, I just had to hide.

...But you could go.
First, you need to get to the
uppermost floor, then keep going
until you find his room.

If you happen to run into Tubba
Blubba, don't, I repeat, DON'T
fight with him.

He's invincible! Really!
Until you find out his secret
weakness you'd better just run
away. You got that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's what my friends and I
managed to find out...

Supposedly there's something
really important hidden in Tubba
Blubba's room on the highest
floor of the castle.

It's so precious to him that he
never lets anybody else even
touch it.

...See? Really suspicious, isn't
it?

First, you need to get to the
uppermost floor, then keep going
until you find his room.

If you happen to run into Tubba
Blubba, don't, I repeat, DON'T
fight with him.

He's invincible! Really!
Until you find out his secret
weakness, run away.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...huh? How long was I asleep?
Where is everyone?

.......Oh well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmm! What's this?
Sniff, sniff...

I smell something very fishy...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm, I might be in trouble.

That Star Spirit ran away...
And now I think someone
suspicious is in the castle...

I sure don't want to make King
Bowser mad. He's scary.

He did make me invincible, but
if I screw up, he might change me
back to normal.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... Time for some beauty rest!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi there!
I'm Yakkey...

...a faithful and chatty follower
of Master Tubba Blubba!
My very important job is to
guard his valuables!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But...?
You don't look like Master Tubba
Blubba at all!

...That means

you've come here to steal me, the
magical key that unlocks the
door to Windy Mill at the foot of
Gusty Gulch?

And furthermore, your goal is to
find out if there's a secret
inside that Windy Mill?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

... You're a very honest person,
aren't you?

...... 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

... You're a terrible liar.

...... 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Heeeeeeelp!
Master Tubba Blubbaaaa!!
A thieeeeeeef!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrgh? Hmmmph?
What's all the noise?
Five more minutes, Mom...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tubba Blubba's waking up! Let's
get outta here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh-oh. We're in trouble! Tubba
Blubba woke up! Let's go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tubba Blubba's up! Let's get
away!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Marioooo! Aackk! Tubba Blubba
woke up! We'll never make it if
we stay here! Run! Run!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no, he's awake!
We have to run!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you! Thief! Stop!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bahh ha ha ha ha!
Caught you, thief!

It's not nice to sneak around in
someone's room!

You must be punished!!

Now you'll see how terrifying  
Invincible Tubba Blubba is!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bah ha ha ha ha!
That wimpy little attack doesn't
hurt me at all!!

Now it's my turn!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome to Blue Station!
Umm... Unfortunately, I can't
take you to the other stations.

We have the station and the
tracks and everything...but
the train's missing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome to Blue Station!
Umm... Unfortunately, I can't

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look, we can't very well ride on
a tiny little Toy Train!
That'd be impossible.

Put that back in its Toy Box!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaaaahoo!♥ 
We're back in business!

This train just dropped out of
the sky and onto the tracks!
Public transit's up and running!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can use the switches in
front of the station to choose
the train's direction.

Just let me know when you've
decided which direction you want
to go, OK?
All aboard!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You can use the switches in
front of the station to choose
the train's direction.

Have you figured out which way
you want to go?

Please tell me again if you're
sure that's the way you want
to go.
All aboard!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Which way are you heading?
Press one of those switches to
choose a direction.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where would you like to go?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please ride with us again, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're leaving! All aboard!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Next stop: Blue Station!
Now arriving at Blue Station!

Toy Box, please get off here.

Welcome to Blue Station,
passengers!

To exit the Toy Box, please use
the jump pad on your left.

Also to the left is a Shy Guy
Playground.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, there's a track problem!
We can't go that direction.

Do you see that lever way behind
us on the left? If you can get
over there and push it, we'll be
able to continue.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think our little track problem
will be fixed if you pull down on
that lever.

Or maybe not. I'm not sure...
Hmmm...
To pull or not to pull?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you think pulling that lever
will fix the tracks?
Hmmm...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, I'll be!
Just as I suspected!

We should have moved that lever
a long time ago!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We can't go to Red Station. 
The tracks are broken, see?

I'm very sorry...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Usually I work here at Blue
Station.
But since there's no train, I'm
pretty much unemployed now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Storeroom Key you have in
your hand... I'm positive the
Shy Guys stole that from
somewhere in Toad Town.

I wonder who they stole it from.
Whoever it was must be mad.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You gave the Storeroom Key back
to the storekeeper?
He must've been super happy!

Happier than I am, anyway.
There's still no train, so I still
don't have a job.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The train's running again!
We can leave anytime!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Frying Pan you have in
your hand... I'm positive the
Shy Guys stole that from
somewhere in Toad Town.

I'm sure whoever owned it must
be all broken up right now.
You can't cook very well without
a Frying Pan.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you know that Shy Guys
really like sweets?
Cakes, candies...you name it.

Supposedly, that's all they'd eat
if they could.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can repair all of the broken
rails along our route by moving
nearby levers.

Obviously, we're going nowhere if
the rails don't get fixed.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can repair all of the broken
rails along our route by moving
nearby levers.

Or maybe not all of them...
What do we do...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Memo you have is written in
Shy Guy language.

Don't look at me! I can't read
Shy Guy language!

You could probably figure it out
if you found someone who's smart
enough.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thanks a lot for figuring
out the secret of the
jack-in-the-box switch.
Now the train can roll again.

Nothing makes me happier than
watching the train roll...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Rumor is that there's a vehicle
very similar to this in the world
outside the box.
They call it a train, too...?

Well...there's no way it can be as
cool as our train...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems as though those Shy
Guys have learned a lesson this
time. Maybe they won't steal
things anymore.

They ought to just learn to live
in peace, surrounded by toys!

A hand holding a toy is less
likely to cause mischief...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Some Shy Guy just ran off to
the right with a Frying Pan!

Ooh, I just bet that he stole it
from some innocent soul!
And you know he doesn't really
want to cook anything with it.

Shy Guys are so obnoxious...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you seen the Gourmet Guy?
He's a huge Shy Guy who's really
particular about food.

Judging by his size, I'd say he's
not all that particular.

He has a serious sweet tooth. I
hear that he really loves Cake.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We have to move some lever in
order to repair the tracks so
we can go to Green Station.

I think it was that pink lever
over there, but...I'm not sure...
I forget...

over there, but...I'm not sure...
I forget...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The tracks are all fixed, so we
can now go to Green Station.
Feel free to use this train
anytime you like!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you seen the Big Lantern
Ghost?
He always hides in gloomy places.
He loves the darkness.

Then again, he's always carrying
this little lantern, so...

...maybe he doesn't like the
darkness all that much...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that the Big Lantern
Ghost took off.
Do you think he left the box?

He won't need that lantern if he
lives somewhere bright.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, Shy Guys made this Toy
Train that we use.

They like to gather worn-out
things that no one uses and turn
them into toys.

They're pretty good at making
something out of nothing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Green Station.
I'm certainly feeling green.
Shy Guys hid our tracks!

How're we supposed to move?

Oh, by the way, a Shy Guy with a
book ran off to the right toward
the Slot Machine.

I'm sure the little rogue stole
that book from someone.

It'll be impossible to catch him
unless you figure out how to get
through the wire fence.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I witnessed a Shy Guy with a
book running to the right,
toward the Slot Machine.

I'm sure the little rogue stole
that book from someone.

It'll be impossible to catch him
unless you figure out how to get

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Memo you have is written in
Shy Guy language.

Don't look at me! I can't read
Shy Guy language!

You could probably figure it out
if you found someone who's smart
enough.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We can go to Red Station now!
Great! Feel free to ride with
us anytime!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like the Shy Guys are
really robbing Toad Town blind.

I've heard them say that they
want Bowser to reward them for
filling up this Toy Box.

It used to be so peaceful inside
here...but it's getting downright
crowded and noisy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sure the Shy Guys are going
to knock it off for a while.

They'll recover eventually,
though, and start gathering
worn-out junk again for their
toy-making needs.

Everyone's much happier when
they only take worn-out stuff
instead of precious items.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The other day, I saw a gang of
Shy Guys carrying a sparkling
card of some sort in a cage.

They headed off to the right...
Do you think I ought to go check
out what they were doing?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You beat that weird, giggling
ghost that likes the dark?

Wow, that's great! Thank you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh. I see. The Shy Guys were
holding a Star Spirit...

I thought they were happy just
making and playing with toys.

Who could want more?

Anyway, our only wish was to
have our train up and running...

And you made it come true!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyeah heh heh...
Perfect. Mario hates this thing,
so he'll surely turn back. 

Uh... I think...
That doesn't look like the sort
of thing that'd bother Mario.

I wonder if I should really trust
what Peach says...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well...it doesn't matter.
King Bowser ordered it.

And he's the boss!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Perfect... Mario really hates
these guys so he'll run. 

Will they really scare him? They
seem pretty weak...

I'm getting a little suspicious of
what Peach tells us... 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well...it doesn't matter.
King Bowser ordered it.

And he's the boss!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyeah heh heh heh!!!
Ooh, I can't wait until Mario
gets here!

He's gonna get beaten so bad! 
He'll probably start crying!

Then King Bowser and I will laugh
and laugh!
Come and get it, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyeah heh heh hah!!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Mario!?
I have to fight Mario?!

By myself? Why me?

I'm toast...but I have to try!
Feel my, uh...wrath, I guess!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's Mario!!
See this fine club I have?
I'm gonna introduce you to it.

Club...meet Mario!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
!!!!!!!!!
Meeeoork! Mario!

This'll be fun!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyuck yuck yuck...
What took you so long, Mario?
Ready to taste my hammer?

Here it comes!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
!!!!!!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes!! I thought you'd come!
Now I get to defeat you and win
admiration from King Bowser.

I'm gonna be famous!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everybody calls me Gourmet Guy.

I don't know why. I'm just an
ordinary, food-loving Shy Guy.

Sigh...
I'm hungry...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm too hungry to move.
I'm famished! I must eat!

I need a sweet, sweet Cake!
Sweet Cake...with frosting...
and cookie crumbles...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleagh!!! Hack! Thppth!
That was disgusting!
That wasn't even food! I can't
believe I ate that!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, ickthpth!!! Bleah!
That's the worst tasting food
I've ever eaten! Ick!

My delicate palate is too refined
to eat this stuff!

I can eat only food of the finest
quality, or I might gag.
I'd rather starve than eat such
inferior food as this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Ohhh, mmmm...
Ohhhhhhh!!!!!

Deeeliciouuuuuuus!!!

This is lip-smacking good!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yuuuuummmm!!!!!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm? What do you want?

Get away from that Treasure
Chest, pal!

It's mine, see?
Don't mess with me!♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You wanna fight? Are you nuts?
You don't wanna mess with me!♥
Are you sure ya wanna fight?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Good. You're a smart boy!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

What!! Well, all right...
I do love a challenge!♥

Here it comes, pal!
Don't say I didn't warn you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sniff sniff... Sniff?
Do I smell Lemon Candy?

Hey! Pal! You have Lemon Candy,
and you didn't tell me? 

Please! I love that stuff!♥
Lemme have some Lemon Candy!
Please! C'mon, pal!

Take the treasure--just gimme
the Lemon Candy, will ya?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrrr!!!
You stingy, candy-hogging punk!

Well, you can forget about
getting my treasure now!
You want it? You're going to
have to fight me for it.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeeeaaaah!♥

I got some Lemon Candy!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...so good...tart...
So yummy...♥♥♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wee hee hee hee...
Someone... has come...

Someone is here in the dark...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wee hee hee...
Oh... Could it be...?
Wee hee hee hee... It's Mario!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Looks like you're mine, Mario!
Wee hee...
I won't let you go...anywhere...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wee hee hee...
I'll take care of you quickly,
then return to my darkness.

I hate the light...

So... I'll take you with me...
...to the deep dark...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Woooaaahh!!

I hate light!!!

I'll make it darker...then even
darker than that...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow, that light! It's so bright...
This is no good...
Here...darker and darker...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooooooooo!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi, mister!
I'm Watt.
Can I, um, get out of here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait, wait!
Don't leave me, please!
Let me out, mister, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm hm hee hee...
Yay! I got out!

Yay for me!
Thanks, mister!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Cough cough...

You're crazy, mister!
Did ya have to, um, blow it up to
get me out?

Jeepers!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey!
Aren't you, um, Mario!?

You just saved me like a hero!
You're a hero, aren't ya?
You're the coolest!!!

You saved me from the mean guy
who laughed like, "Wee hee hee!"
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I gotta make it up to you!
I'll go with you, Mario, OK?

I heard the, um, Shy Guys saying
that you're trying to save 
Princess Peach from Bowser.

You're super great!
You're the greatest great guy!
I think you're the best!

So, um, I really want to help.
I'll be good, really!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh, it's pretty dark, huh?
I kinda like the dark...

But, um, now I can show you how
helpful I can be, OK? 

Use my power, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow, pretty cool, huh?
Look! It's so bright now!
Tee hee hee...

I bet nobody else can help out
like that, huh? Can they?

Nope! Now! Let's go!
Hm hee hee hee...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Run! Run for it!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waaah! Help me!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So, you came, did you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm General Guy.
We're following the orders of
King Bowser by guarding a Star
Spirit.

As long as we keep it secure, we
have permission to do whatever
we want. You hear!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I don't care for you, sir. You
are rude, and furthermore,
you're trespassing in here.

Our Toy Box is off limits to the
likes of you!
The treasures inside this box
are for Shy Guys only!

And that Star Spirit's fate is
none of your business!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Prepare to fight me, sir!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Taste defeat!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Charge!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, guys! All together now!
Let's rush him!

Chaaaaarge!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're gonna lose!!
Oh, no! We've gotta run!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait! Stand your ground, men!
Now's no time for cowards!

I will not abide deserters!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait! Stand your ground, men!
Now's no time for cowards!

I will not abide deserters!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mercy, he beat 'em all up!
That surely isn't good...

Guess it's up to me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You men make me sick!
We must protect the Toy Box!
Am I the only one with guts?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! You, sir, will pay!
You beat my infantry, 

but that's all you'll do!

Prepare for the next wave!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Go! Attack, Stilt Guys!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrrrrrrr!!!!
Unbelievable!!

I guess it's time for my special
battalion...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!!
I pity you, sir!!
It's time you paid, Mario!

Attaaaaaaaack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, sir!!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
............

Gah! Grrrr...!
Fine! I'll beat you myself!

Nobody embarrasses the brave
Shy Guys of my army! Nobody!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrr!

My high-tech tank defenses
don't seem to stand up to that
electric attack!

Quit doing that!
It's...it's too powerful! You're
breaking the rules of war!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrr!!!!!

Stop it!! That's unfair!
You're going to go and break my
extremely expensive tank!

I'm serious! Quit that attack!
It's...it's too powerful! You're
breaking the rules of war!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!

That hurt!!
Where'd you learn to fight?

You must be cheating!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yay! Yippeeee!!
We beat the Shy Guys!
Hm hm hee hee hee!!!

You weren't so tough, you silly
old Shy Guys!

I beat 'em up!
... Didn't I, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you want me to take you back
to Toad Town, just ask.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, well. Finally made it, eh?
So this is Lavalava Island...
Smashing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gracious! Behold, Mario!
There! Off in the distance!
The top of Mt. Lavalava!

Triumphant! We must hurry!
Make haste!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you want to go back to Toad
Town?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Back to the sea!
Splooooooosh!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

If you want me to take you back
to Toad Town, just ask.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well. Mario, old boy!
Certainly took your time, eh?
Let's head back together, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a heady adventure!
Adieu, Lavalava Island!
Perchance someday I shall
return to your shores!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wooooooooooooooooooooooh!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wheeze wheeze wheeze...

Yes! I...cough...did it!
I swam...all the way!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, Mario!
Now I'm going to give you a
beating you'll never...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!? Wait!
Where are you going!
Wait! Mario, wait up!!

Come back here, you chicken!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shooooooooooooooooooooot!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaaaaaaargh!
Help, I say! Heeeeeelp!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow! Mario!
You're supposed to attack the
other guy, old bean!

Do you have issues with me?
A bit of jealousy, perhaps?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew... You saved me!
Many thanks, old chum.

Well, enough of that!
Let's pull ourselves together
and press on, what say?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaaah! Get off! Aaaaaah!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dear me! I barely got away...

That was rather rude, Mario!
Leaving me like that! Hmph!

Well, we can't all be heroes...
Let's press on, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I swear, all of these natives are
so panicky that we can't get
any information!

I guess someone had better solve
their problem so we can quiz
them, eh, old boy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, old man,
the Village Leader was just
looking for you.

I'd say he wants to thank you.
Better hurry, hm?

He might just tell you where the
treasure is if he's feeling
thankful enough!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well...finally.
Everyone's calmed a bit.

Now we can get some good
information about treasure from
these locals.

Well... Where to start...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We simply must go search for
that treasure at the volcano.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I must get my hands on the
volcano's treasure!

My keen intuition senses that
there must be a way!

Hmmm...
I suppose there's a slim chance
it was blown clear in the
eruption...

I'd best check around the village
for some clues.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm?

You know, dear boy, I couldn't
help but notice you holding
something resembling treasure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Good heavens!
It's the treasure!
How on earth did you...

...well, I suppose that's of no
consequence right now. You're
giving it to me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You...you are giving it to me?!
Oh, glory! Marvelous!!

Dear man, you are quite simply
the cat's meow!

Cheers!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, hm! I suppose...
It's only proper that I give this
to you as thanks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Bub-ulb gave it to me while
I was off exploring.

I'm sure it's quite a valuable
seed, but I'm not interested in
it at all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now that I've got the treasure,
I proclaim this adventure to be
a complete success!

What a stupendous expedition!
It will be forever recorded in
the history of archaeology!

Well, old boy, let's away!
Back to Toad Town with us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Kolorado, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, good show!
It's a letter from my wife.

Thank you ever so, old chap.
This is just what I needed to
give me the strength to go on.

...I know!
I'll pass this along as a spot of
thanks.

I came across it while I was
wandering about the jungle
researching things.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Welcome to you, Mario.
I am the Village Leader of 
Yoshi's Village.

...Ah, you come seeking help.
You wish to go to Mt. Lavalava,
do you?

Mmmm...
The entrance to the volcano is
in the jungle, but it's very
difficult to get to it.

The volcano has awakened, as
well. I think it may be too
dangerous for you to go there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I must thank you.

You have saved the children of
the village. I feel that no
expression of our gratitude
could be enough.

You truly are a hero.
We deeply appreciate your valor.

At least I can do this...
You still wish to go to Mt.
Lavalava, don't you?

I have remembered a good way to
reach the volcano.

Please come this way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I must thank you.

You have saved the children of
the village. I feel that no
expression of our gratitude
could be enough.

You truly are a hero.
We deeply appreciate your valor.

I have heard from your
companion, Kolorado, that you
wish to go to Mt. Lavalava.

Since you have blessed our
village with your kindness, I will
show you the best way to reach
the volcano.

Please come this way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...? I thought it was...
somewhere around here...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yes. I found it. Here it is.
Take it, please.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whenever events beyond our
control occur on this island, we
ask the help of Raphael the
Raven, the island's master.

If anyone can help you reach the
volcano, it's definitely Raphael
the Raven. He lives in the depths
of this island.

If you place that Jade Raven
into the statue of Raphael, the
way into the depths of the
jungle will appear.

I haven't been to see Raphael
since I was but a young Yoshi.

I remember that it was
incredibly difficult to find him
because the jungle's trees and
shrubs covered the way.

I'm sure you'll find the path.
May all your wishes come true.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait just one minute...
You must have one heck of a
story behind you, Mario.

Why in the world would you want
to go to Mt. Lavalava?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait just one minute...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Why in the world would you want
to go to Mt. Lavalava?

I'm sorry, but I can't just keep
my mouth shut when I hear
someone talking crazy.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

It's VERY hot and VERY 
dangerous in the volcano!

If you aren't extremely careful
AND lucky, you'll be roasted to
a golden brown.

But you don't care. You guys are
going there anyway!
I do NOT approve of this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh-huh... Oh... Oh!

You're going to the volcano
because you want to save the
princess from some bad guys?

What...a touching story!
Romantic stories like that...
just touch a soft spot in this
heart of mine.

That does it! I can't let you go
alone! I, Sushie, will be by your
side until the end!

You needn't worry, Mario! I love
taking care of others!

If you plan on getting through
this jungle, you need me anyway.

Come, Mario! That volcano isn't
getting any cooler! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you put that Jade Raven into
the statue of Raphael, the way
into the depths of the jungle
will appear.

Since trees and bushes have
grown over the path, you might
get lost.

If you do, just be sure to scout
the area carefully.
You might have to do something
unexpected to find your way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So, Raphael the Raven granted
you an audience, did he?
I'm not surprised, Mario.

You saved the children... 
You are one of the honored
members of this island now.

The great Raphael probably
thought so, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please don't tell Kolorado about
Raphael the Raven or the way to
the volcano.

That Koopa's a bit loopy. I
shudder to think what he'd do.
I must say I worry he'd harm
himself inside the volcano.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see you are finally going to
brave the volcano.
Please be careful, Mario...

If you don't watch your step,
you'll get burned.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The volcano is dangerous.
Don't push yourself too hard.

If you start getting weak, come
relax at the village.

After all, Lavalava Island is
just the spot for relaxation.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mt. Lavalava just started
erupting, Mario!

It's my belief that the volcano
got angry because Bowser's men
were fiddling about inside.

I'm glad you made it out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mt. Lavalava is becoming less
active every day.
We don't have to worry about
lava-proofing the village.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Village Leader is my friend.
I mean, hello! How are you?

But anyway, ever since he was
a child, the Village Leader has
had a very strong sense of
personal responsibility.

When I heard he was going to be
the Village Leader, I wasn't
surprised at all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Village Leader used to get
into all sorts of mischief when
he was younger. He used to give
his parents fits!

The jungle wasn't as dangerous
back then as it is now.

He used to climb trees, throw
rocks, tease Ravens...
You name some mischief, and I
guarantee you he did it.

...Heh heh.
Maybe you'd better not tell him
I told you all that stuff.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aah! No! Oh, no!
The village...there's...big trouble
at the village!

Please, ask the Village Leader
about what's happened.
I don't dare talk about it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario! Please!
Find those poor children!

The Yoshi Kids from this village
are like grandchildren to me.
Oh, those poor babies...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I don't know how to thank you
for saving the children!
You've done a great thing.

The Village Leader said there's
something he wants to give you,
you know.

He's waiting for you over there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, Mario.
We owe you a deep debt for
saving our sweet children.

Please think of this village as if
it were your home.
We will always welcome you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You went into Mt. Lavalava?
How brave you are, Mario!

The Village Leader and I went up
to the volcano a long time ago,
but I never thought about going
inside!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's really rare for Mt.
Lavalava to erupt.
It really caught me off guard.

It once erupted when the Village
Leader and I were kids.

I was surprised then, too. I
thought that the sky and earth
were trading places.

...Hey. Don't tell anyone, but
the Village Leader couldn't even
move because he was paralyzed
with terror. Ha ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi, Mario! What an unexpected
pleasure!

How's your adventure going?
I hope you'll have time to relax
while you're on the island.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi! Hello. Howdy!
This is Yoshi's Village.

Mt. Lavalava, you say?

Well, the volcano is just to the
east of our village, but there's
no way to reach it.

Besides, the Village Leader said
it's best not to get too close
because it looks like it might
erupt any day.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! Someone help!
Emergency! Eeeemergency!
The kids are gone!

I looked along the shore, but
there was no trace of them!

Oh, where could they be...?
What if they're in trouble in the
jungle somewhere?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! Someone help!
Emergency! Eeeemergency!
The kids are gone!

I looked along the shore, but
there was no trace of them!

Oh, where could they be...?
What if they're in trouble in the
jungle somewhere?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wandering around in the jungle 
without any adults...

I wonder where my poor son
could be...

I'm worried sick about him.
Where would he hide?

Mario, please find my son!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My son is back!
Oh, I'm so relieved.
I was really starting to worry.

Please, Mario, find the other
lost children, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks to you, the kids are all
back, safe and sound.
Oh, thank you so much!

Our Village Leader said he wants
to thank you personally.
Go see him, please!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm glad the kids are back 
safely, but...

they're causing mischief again.
Children can be so troublesome!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That eruption was terrible! 
It went... KA-WHOOMP!!
I've never seen anything like
that before, that's for sure!

I don't think the lava will come
near the village, 
but it's still kind of unnerving.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Every time we adults turn our
backs for a second, the kids
start getting into trouble.

Do you think I should wish to the
Stars that they become well-
behaved, model children?

Somehow I think that wish is
beyond the power of the Star
Spirits...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey there, Mario.
Have you met the Ravens yet?
They live at the top of the
biggest tree in the village.

There are lots of them, but they
never come down.
They speak a different language
from ours, too.

Pretty mysterious, huh?

Everyone says they're the
disciples of the master of this
island, Raphael the Raven,
but... Do you really think so?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, man! What're we gonna do?
The kids have disappeared!
Aw, what should we do?
We've gotta do something!

OK, calm down... Get ahold of
yourself... We should consult
the Village Leader...

...Yes, the Leader'll know...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Playing hide-and-seek? 
He should know better than to
play that in the jungle!

He could be stranded on some
remote little islet right now,
crying his head off.

Oh, how terrible... I'm so
worried...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you for finding my son!
Please, if you could, find the
other boys as well.

Oh, that little monster...
I thought he'd been unusually
quiet recently. Just look what
he was planning!

I'm going to give him a scolding
he'll never forget!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those boys promised they'd
never go into the jungle alone...

Little troublemakers...
This could have turned into a
serious situation if you hadn't
found them, Mario.

You wouldn't believe the scolding
I gave them. They ought to
behave themselves for a while.
At least I hope they do.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I remember there was this huge
sound like KER-FWAANG!... and
then the earth shook...

I never really believed that
Mt. Lavalava would erupt.

I guess I should've listened
when the Village Leader said it
looked like it would erupt.
I hope it never does again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
Is something bad happening?

I feel like you only show up
where there's danger.
Ha ha...maybe not always.

Good luck on your adventures.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, well... Hello!
If it isn't Mario!
Welcome to Lavalava Island!

This island's almost entirely
covered by a thick jungle.
Still, how can you beat living
in this tropical climate?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! We have a huge problem!
The children have disappeared!

Well! What should I...?
Hmm...oh...what'll...no...
Village Leader...should...

Auuugh! I can't explain!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Auuugh! I can't explain!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where on earth could my son be!
Oh, if we don't find him soon,
he might be in grave danger...

No... I know my son. Probably
sleeping in some tree somewhere.

Mario, please find my son next!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, Mario! Thank you!
I can't tell you how relieved I
felt when I saw my son's face.

...I shouldn't say that so loud.
There are still kids out there,
lost in the jungle.

Please, you have to find them!
I hope they aren't somewhere
scary, alone and afraid...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm so glad the kids are safely
back from that dangerous
jungle...

We owe you, Mario!

The kids seemed like they got
scared by the experience, but
they still didn't learn anything.

Sigh...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The kids looked shaken up when
they first got back from the
jungle, but they're OK now.

They didn't learn their lesson.
Those little scamps.

Still... I can't be angry at them.
I'm so happy they're safe.
It's all thanks to you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was taking a nap and all of
a sudden I heard a KAABOOOOM,
and the earth started shaking
like it was gonna split open!

I never believed any of the
eruption rumors,

so I thought the entire island
was moving somewhere.
That was no fun at all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello again!
Just couldn't stay away from
scenic Lavalava Island, huh?

The kids will be really happy.
Why don't you say hi to them?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's so rare to have visitors
these days.
I'd love to stop and chat, but
I have my fins full.

I'm watching these boys, who are
very, VERY naughty, so they
don't do anything dangerous.

I can't prove it yet, but I bet
they're planning something...

Well, if they think they can fool
Sushie, they'd better think
again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, welcome!
We don't get visitors to this
island very often.

You should know that the jungle
beyond here is dangerous.
Our kids are forbidden to go in.

Oh, and by the way, I just saw
a Koopa guy who calls himself
an archaeologist running in the 
opposite direction...

He was saying something about
finding a way to the volcano.
Now there's a guy who's heading
for danger...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's terrible! Just terrible!
The kids are all gone!

We told them a thousand times
never go into the jungle!

Sushie went after them! She's a
Cheep Cheep who always takes
care of the kids.

How could this have happened!
There must be a reason!

Mario, please! Please help!
Look for the kids!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ohhhhh...
Where could my kid have gone!?

I hope he wasn't playing on any
spinning flowers.

When you spin on those flowers,
you'll fly up into the air. Who
knows where you'll come down!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you for finding my son!

He's a bad boy for making
everybody worry so. Very bad!

I'm still worried about the other
boys, too...

There are so many dangers in
the jungle...so many creatures
with evil hearts...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everyone has finally calmed down
since you found the kids.

Thank you, thank you!
Children are treasured by
everyone in the village.

That reminds me... The Village
Leader wishes to thank you.
You should go over to see him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario, you're OK!
After that huge eruption, we
wondered if you made it out.

The Village Leader claims that
Bowser's men heated up the
volcano too much so it blew.

I could do without such scary
natural disasters, thank you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi, Mario!
Welcome back!

How are things on the mainland?
Our children love to hear stories
from afar...and I guess I kind
of do, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How are you, Mario?
Hey, have you talked with the 
Cheep Cheep over there yet?

She's famous around here for
being a great baby-sitter. Her
name is Sushie.

She watches over the kids.
What would we do without her?

Sometimes the kids complain
about her, but kids are kids.

By the way, an archaeologist 
named Kolorado or something 
went into the jungle alone.

He said he was making for
Mt. Lavalava, but the path ends
halfway there. I wonder how far
he got...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The kids are gone!
The only place they could have
gone is...gulp!...the jungle!

I had a feeling they were up to
something lately,

but I thought it was just
mischief! I didn't think they'd
go into such a dangerous area!

What do we do?!
How will we find them?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where? Where are those kids?!
Where could my son be?!

How deep into the jungle could
a little kid get?

Oh, what if some nasty creature
attacks him and...
Oh, I can't even think about it!
I'm so worried!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks for saving my son!

Really! Thanks so much!
I don't want to imagine what 
might have happened if he'd 
stayed out there longer...

Oh, but other kids ARE still out
there! The poor dears.
Please find them, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The kids are all back!
I was heartbroken thinking of
how scared and lonely they must
have been,

but as soon as they got back,
they just said they were hungry.
Pfff! Kids! How typical.

I suppose it's natural for
children to be energetic, but
they need to be safe, too.

They never learn... Oh, by the
way, our Village Leader wants
to thank you.
You'd better go see him.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The eruption of Mt. Lavalava
really threw me for a loop.
I think I lost my appetite.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello again, Mario.
Great to see you!

Eat anything tasty lately?
Everyone seems jolly when they
have something good to eat.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmm...? Sniff sniff...

Something smells...really good...
Is that delicious smell coming
from something you're carrying?

Whatever it is, I want to try it!
C'mon, what is it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh, thank you!♥
It looks so good...

Oh yeah...
Here, why don't you take this
as a thank-you from me.

It grows in a place that only
I know about.
Trust me--it's good!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What? No!?
Oh, lame...

Listen to my stomach growl! If
you change your mind, bring me
something tasty.
Something I've never eaten...

My belly and I are waiting!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're the Fearsome 5 of Yoshi's
Village! Yeah!
We play hide-and-seek together.

We can't leave the village,
though, so it's sorta boring.
I wanna play somewhere bigger
and more exciting!

And I wanna see the jungle!

It's dangerous, y'know!
Now that'd be exciting!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, thanks for finding me!
This jungle's full of danger.

I mean, the village is boring.
Compared to the village, the
jungle's really exciting.

It was scary, yeah, but fun.

I guess I have to be a good boy
for a while now.
You'd better find the other guys
soon before they get lost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fearsome 5 are baaaaack!
We got scolded, so we'll be
good...for now. Heh heh...

But we'll be back doing exciting
things again soon! Yeah!

Hey, Mario, what're you doing
now, huh? Something fun?
What? You're gonna go inside the
volcano?

Oh boy, that sounds awesome!
I wish I could go, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kwwaaaaaa-yaaaaah!
Radical!

Eruptions are awesome!
I was so scared and excited
that I couldn't sit still!

Hey, Mario! Were you inside the
volcano when it blew up? Huh?
Were you?

Wooooowee!
What was it like? Huh?

What? You're in a hurry?
Oh, man. What a bummer.

You've gotta promise me you'll
come back here someday!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! Mario is back!

We've been waiting for you.
Tell us your story now!

What exciting adventure are you
on right now? Huh?
Tell us, tell us, tell us now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's Mario!
Hey, Mario.
Are you looking for adventure?

If you want, we'll go with you.

You won't have to worry at all.
The Fearsome 5's got your back!
Let's go to the jungle!

We're not scared! We just can't
ever go 'cause that meddlesome
ol' Cheep Cheep stops us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We just wanted to go somewhere
exciting where there were no
grown-ups and where we could do
whatever we wanted. See?

I mean, so we went into the
jungle and all, but
it was scary, and there were
bad guys, and I got tired...

I'll be good...for now.

I'm sorry if people worried.
I'm glad you found me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fearsome 5 are baaaack!
When all of us are together, we
fear nothing and nobody!

Sure, the jungle was scary, but
did we have fun? Oh, yeah!

I think it's time for another
adventure of the Fearsome 5!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hoooooo Waaaaaah!!!
All right! Grrrrrrreat!!!

Did you see that fire blow out
of the mountain?
Dazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzling!!

Something else flew out, too.

Looks like checking it out is a
job for the Fearsome 5!

But... I guess we can't.

Until I get bigger, I guess I'll
just listen to the stories of
your adventures.

So that means you have to come
visit us all the time and tell us
stories, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoopee! Yippee!! Hooray!!!
You came back, Mario!
You came to hang with the 5!

Tell us all about your
adventures over the sea!

If you do, we'll tell you all the
tricks we played while you were
away. Hee hee...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Red Yoshi Kid...
Ah, you must be the one.

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thanks. I wonder what it is.
Oh, my pal made up a new game!
I've gotta play this later!

He also wants me to come over
to his town and play with him
sometime.
But how can I get there?

...Oh well.
Maybe someday I'll be able to
cross the sea and hang out.

It's really funny, 'cause I was
just writing him a letter about
a game I made up!

Mr. Parakarry, will you help?
Here. Deliver my letter to the
Toad Kid who asked you to send
this one to me.

Could you? Thanks!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're the Fearsome 5 of Yoshi's
Village. We're all best friends,
y'know.

We're together when we play and
when we get in trouble. We're
always together!

Of course, now we won't be.
We're playing hide-and-seek,
and I'm "it." I hate being "it."

Hmmmph...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That jungle was dangerous, huh?
And scary, too, right?

People told us not to go, but it
made us want to even more.

Now I won't go anymore.
I'm really sorry for making
everyone worry so much.

And now some of the guys are
still out there! Sniffle...
I wish they'd...sniff...come back
soon...

I just wanna play hide-and-seek
together again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fearsome 5 are baaaaaack!
Back from the depths of the wild
jungle!

There was danger! Intrigue!
Yoshi-eating beasts!
I was a little scared! 
But I wanna go there again!

Tee hee...
Oh, no. Just kidding.

Hey, Mario, are you really going
to the volcano now?
It's really hot. And dangerous.

Grown-ups always tell us not to
go to dangerous places, but
you're allowed to go?

That's not fair!
Kids get no respect!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did ya see that eruption?

The other 4 were surprised, but
I wasn't. Not too much, anyway.

I'm different from the others.
A little braver, you know.

So, are you leaving now?
Uh-huh...
You could drop by every now and
then if you wanted.

I mean, I don't care, but the
other 4 might miss you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! It's Mario!
Are you back for another
exciting adventure?

I didn't miss you, but the other
4 really did.

If you want, you can hang with
me for a while. You know, just
chill. I won't even talk to you or
anything.

Tee hee...
You could even tell me about your
adventures if you want.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're the Fearsome 5!
When we arrive, it's live at 5! 
We always stick together!
Even when we're being bad...

Speaking of which, today's the
day we put our secret plan into
action. It's so cool!

Only we 5 know the plan, and
that's the way it has to be.
Sorry, can't tell you...

Oh, man, I'm so excited!
I hope I can find a lot of tasty
fruit in the jungle...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you for coming out to look
for us.
I was starting to get a little
worried out there.

Hey, but some of the guys still
aren't back yet!
You've gotta find them soon!

It wasn't our fault! We were
playing hide-and-seek in the
jungle and just got lost!

I mean, there were tons of cool
things in the jungle, but a lot
of them were scary!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fearsome 5 are baaaack!

Boy, there was a lot of tasty
food growing in the jungle!
That adventure was both
thrilling and filling! Ha!

Everyone gives me flack for
eating all the time, but what
else is there to do here?

If you go on an adventure,
you've gotta take snacks.
Even grown-ups know that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! What a huge explosion!
It went Kaaaa-BLOOOOIE!

I swear I saw something fly out
of there into the jungle.

Maybe... I wonder if it was
something delicious.

I told the grown-ups that they
ought to go check it out, but
they just scolded me.

You know, kids have a hard time.

I'm gonna be a grown-up soon,
and I'm gonna be nice to kids.
And I'm gonna have adventures.

Come back sometime, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
How's your adventure?
Eat any good stuff so far?

I wanna hear your stories.
Hey, hey! Come on! I wanna hear
some stories!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's Mario!
You're on an adventure or
something, right?

Wow, cool! 

Who's that with you? Is that
your partner?

Man, I wish I could be...
That'd be a dream come true.

The grown-ups won't let us out
of the village because they say
it's too dangerous.

That meddling old Cheep Cheep is
always watching us, and she
won't let us enter the jungle.

Heh heh. We'll see about that. 
Us guys? The Fearsome 5? We
aren't afraid of anything.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I got scolded really bad...
Everyone was really worried
about me.

I came back all right, so what's
the big deal?

I had to promise I wouldn't do
anything dangerous again.
Hmph. Hey, but thanks for coming
and finding me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Fearsome 5 are baaaaack!

There's nothing to be afraid of
when all of us are together.
We aren't scared of the jungle.

We aren't scared of anything!
5 friends 4-ever!
Even after we're grown-ups,
we'll still be friends!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Mario!
Oh, it was totally cool! 
What a crazy eruption!
Dynamite!!

Does it get any cooler than the
volcano on Lavalava Island?
I don't think so!

What IS beyond this island?
Anything cool? I wanna go see!

Mario! C'mon!
Come back to the island and tell
us about your travels!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yippee! Hooray! Welcome back!
What adventures have you been
on so far?!

Tell us, tell us!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caaaw!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw?

Are you the Mario that Master
Raphael the Raven was telling us
about?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oracle of the Stars...
Mario comes to this island...

Mario is fated to meet Master 
Raphael the Raven...
Caaaaw...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw. Cawcaaaw!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Cawcawcaaaw?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Cawcawcaw.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Toad House's slogan is...
"Refresh Your Body and Soul!"

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Really?
Mario, you look just fine.
Do you still want to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come again, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Have a pleasant rest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you get some rest?

Good luck on your adventure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, such ill fortune!
The children are missing!

They seem to have secretly
slipped off to the jungle.

They don't know its dangers!
We must get them back here to
safety!

Mario,
could I ask you to look for these
lost children?

As you can see, the Yoshis of
my village are panicking. They
aren't thinking straight.

I'll try to calm them down.
You just find those kids!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I can't tell you how
dangerous the jungle is.

It's even dangerous for us adult
Yoshis if we aren't extremely
careful.

To imagine the boys in such a
place... Brrr...
...Please, you must find them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You've found them!

Oh, happiness! Oh, joy!

But...there are still boys stuck
out there in the jungle.
Please find them!

Five children in all disappeared
into the jungle.
Save all of them, please!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Three of the boys are back!
Terrrrific!!

I'm so glad they're safe.

But two are still missing. 
Please find them!

Everyone is starting to calm
down now that you're helping.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Just one more remains!
Please find him right away!

You seem to be an expert at
finding lost children, Mario!
We're counting on you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Get back here this instant!!
You little ingrates!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you! Down there!
Look up here if you hear me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is so embarrassing... I'm
stuck in this tree.
Can you help me out somehow?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come on, now! Try harder!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well! I never!
You're going to turn your back
on someone in need?!
You hard-hearted man!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, wait!
You almost had it! You just have
to hit the tree a bit more.
Don't quit now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, phew...I'm saved.
I feel like one big ache.

Thanks for getting me out of
that tree. I think I'll be OK now.

Oh! Oh...those little...
I was chasing those naughty
little Yoshi boys, and I fell into
their trap.

Don't they know how dangerous it
is to go into the jungle?
I have to find them before they
get in too deep! 

As for you, you'd better get
back to the village, too. It's
dangerous out here.

Why on earth did you come into
the jungle, anyway?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well! So!
You're looking for those little
rascals, as well.

Then, I don't see why we don't
just look for them together.

They really don't understand the
dangers of the jungle, so we
have to find them soon...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, my! How impolite!
I haven't even asked your name.
What is it, pray tell?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, huh?

Hmmm. Well, I've never heard of
you before.
You must be from far away or
something.

Enjoy lovely Lavalava Island!
...That's what I'd usually say, 
to a visitor, anyway, 

but first, could you help me find
these boys?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yo, what's up?
Thanks for waking me up.

This island's so nice, isn't it?
It's the perfect place for
napping. Perfect temperature.

I'm a Bub-ulb.
My job is to fill this world with
flowers. Nice, huh?

I want you to take this seed.

...Or rather, that's what I want
to say to you.
Unfortunately, the seed isn't 
quite ready yet.

Don't worry, though. It'll be
ready anytime now.
Waiting in such a warm, comfy
place can't be all bad, right?

Come grab the seed later.
I'm pretty generous, so I'll be
here giving stuff to people.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you come for the seed?
Sorry, but it's not ready yet.

Don't be in such a hurry.
Time flies when you chase it.

Come back after a while. And try
to relax, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hello. How are you doing?
What? You want that seed?

Aw, I completely forgot you!
I just gave it to a guy named
Kolorado or something.

Sorry about that.
I'm so generous that I just have
to give something to everyone.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, there's my seed!
So you were able to track it
down after all?
Oh, that's cool.

When I thought about it later, I
had a feeling it would've been
better to give that seed to you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yo, what's up?
I can't get over how perfect the
temperature is around here.

We have to thank the sun that 
it's so warm. Thanks, bud!
So luxurious...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waaaah! It's dark! I'm scared!

There was this flower that spun
around and I thought it was way
cool so I got on it.

And then I spun around and
around and then I was up in the
air and flying and then I ended
up here!

I didn't know how I got here.
It was so dark...and scary...
and I couldn't find a way out.

Thanks for coming to get me out
of here!

I can see how to get out now, so
I'm going straight home!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Buh-buh-boooo huh-hoooo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aiigh! That was so scary!

We were playing hide-and-seek
and there was this weird plant
and it trapped me here!

Sushie, you were right! This
jungle's really dangerous!
I'm sorry I disobeyed you.

Thanks for coming to get me.
I'm going home now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aiigh! That was so scary!

We were playing hide-and-seek
and there was this weird plant
and it trapped me here!

Sushie was right... We should've
just stayed inside the village to
play hide-and-seek.
We should've obeyed her.

Thanks for coming to get me.
I'm going home now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wuh-huh-waaaaaaa!
Sniff sniff...

We were playing hide-and-seek.
I had to be "it," but I couldn't
find anyone at all.

I was wandering around, and
then I got lost.
You were right, Sushie. The
jungle's really scary.

Thanks for coming all the way
out here to look for me.
I'll be a good boy from now on
and listen to you...

Mario, will you be "it" for
hide-and-seek instead of me?
I'm going home now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wuh-huh-waaaaaaa!
Sniff sniff...

We were playing hide-and-seek.
I had to be "it," but I couldn't
find anyone at all.

I was wandering around, and 
then I got lost.
This jungle is way too scary for
kids like us, I think.

Maybe we should have listened to
Sushie's advice...

Mario, will you be "it" for
hide-and-seek instead of me?
I'm going home now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeeeeeeeek!
Somebody, help me!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm so scared...
I wanna go home!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whuh-waaa! Are they all gone?

I'm sorry for disobeying you and
going into the jungle...

I'll be a good boy now.
When you say stuff, Sushie, I'll
listen. I swear.

Thanks for saving me.
I'm going straight home now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whuh-waaa! Are they all gone?
I thought those things were
going to eat me right up!

Thanks for saving me, Mario!
I'll do what you grown-ups tell
me to do from now on.

I don't even wanna do bad things
anymore.
I just wanna be a good boy.

I'm going home now. Bye!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Zzzzzzz............
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh... Morning.

Hey, it's Mario. What's the
matter with you?
You were looking for me?
Oh? Sushie, too?

We were playing hide-and-seek,
and I got real sleepy.
I figured I'd take a nap here.

There's nothing to worry about.
The jungle's not so bad.

I am starting to get a little
bit lonely, though, so maybe
I ought to head back home.
Bye now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh... Morning.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grraahahahoho!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaaaaaaargh!!


Yeeeeek!
H---E---L---P... HELP!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow! Get ahold of yourself!
What do you say you attack the
enemies instead of me, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, this time you came through.

Awfully good of you, old chap!

Now, I feel that our destination,
the volcano, is quite near.
Let's press on while our spirits
are high, eh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew... You saved me once more.

You're top notch, Mario!

Now, I feel that our destination,
the volcano, is quite near.
Let's press on while our spirits
are high, eh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yow! Off me, you brute! Aargh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That was frightful...

Have you no manners, Mario?!
Going on without me!! You boor!

...Well, not everyone is noble.
It would seem that our goal, the
volcano, is quite near.

Let's press on, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! Mario...

Have a look at this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Looks like the entrance to the
volcano, eh, old boy?

Somewhere in that volcano are
the treasures I'm looking for!
I know it! The secrets of an
ancient civilization!

And yet...
I can't find a way in...
Bit of a sticky wicket, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But I shall not give up!
A good explorer never stops
gathering information.

Let's go back to the village to
look for clues.

There must be a way in there.
There simply must!
Come now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh... Geaargh!!


S--T--O--P! STOP IT!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Oh ho ho ho!
Did you think I was beset by
enemies again, old boy? 
Just a bit of a joke!

Explorers must have a sense of
humor, don't you know.

At any rate...
Let's move on, hm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aye aye, all right.
Is everyone ready?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now, Ravens!
Get to work!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw caaaw.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This won't take long.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm!?
What in blazes...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw caw caaaw!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Finished!
Caw!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Roger that!
You can reach the volcano now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh! Top notch, really!!
It would appear we can enter
the volcano, dear boy!

What luck, eh, Mario?
I shan't delay another moment!

The ancient treasures are 
calling me! Onward!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Koopa! What a maverick!
Charging into the volcano...
He's bold, I'll give him that!

Bold and certifiably nuts...
But enough about that! I want
to give you that important item
I was talking about.

Here, take it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's an Ultra Stone. I found
it a long time ago in the depths
of this jungle.

Now that you have this stone,
when you find a Super Block,

you can upgrade one of your
party members from Super Rank
to Ultra Rank.

Strengthening the members of
your party will be the key to
your success. Trust me.

That's what a Star Spirit told
me in a dream.

Use it and prosper!
I've got to go now.
Over and out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw cawcaw caaaw...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Caw cawcaw.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, woe is me...
My beautiful treasure...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen to you!

No treasure in the world is more
valuable than life! Be thankful
you escaped!

To think! This island was put in
terrible peril because of the
meddling of Bowser's men.

I think it will work out OK. The
eruption will subside, and Lava-
lava Island will be just the same
as it used to be.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But... Sigh...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dear Mario!
You have saved five of us Star
Spirits now!

Just a few more to go!

My name is Misstar.
Let me grant you Power that will
help you along!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have to go back to Star Haven
for now, but if you need me,
please call on me at any time.

I will be watching you and
wishing for your success.
I know you'll see the princess
soon enough, Mario. Have faith.

Thank you again for saving me.
See you soon!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... I was so close...
The treasure...right there...

And then to get saved and
yelled at by some sort of
blooming great starfish...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!

Welcome!

Sorry I'm so surprised, but I
can't even remember the last
time someone came up here.
It's sure been a while.

What? Oh yes! Affirmative!
I'm the master of this island.
Call sign: Raphael the Raven!

If you have any problems at all,
just let me know, OK?
Go ahead, out with it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah. Oh, so you're Mario.
I see. Roger that.

You can't find a way to reach
the volcano, is that it?
Yeah, that's a problem.
Not for me, though. I'll help.

To be honest with you, I knew
you'd ask something like that.
I got a message from the Stars,
so I knew you were coming.

I've got something exceptional
to give you that ought to help
you on your way...

But that's for later!

Right now, let's take care of
that volcano problem, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Caw caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Cawcaaaw caw.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Excellent response time, Ravens.
We've got work to do.

I'll brief you only once, so I
want your full attention!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...and it must be done just as
quickly as possible.
Got it?
I should hope so!

Let's move, Ravens!
Follow me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Something else you need?
Don't bother me for no reason.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Heave-HOOOOOOO!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come on, then.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You must follow Master Raphael
the Raven.
Caw!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Kolorado, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A letter? For me? All the way
out here on Lavalava Island?
How very rare...

Oh, good show!
It's a letter from my wife.

Thank you ever so, old chap.
This is just what I needed to
give me the strength to go on.

...I know!
I'll pass this along as a spot of
thanks.

I came across it while I was
wandering about the jungle
researching things.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pardon me for interrupting your
work, but...
You're Kolorado, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
Are you all right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeeow ow ow...!
The treasures are waiting for
me over there, I know it...
Oh, a letter...

Oh, good show!
It's a letter from my wife.

Thank you ever so, old chap.
This is just what I needed to
give me the strength to go on.

...I know!
I'll pass this along as a spot of
thanks.

I came across it while I was
wandering about the jungle
researching things.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
INVADERS DETECTED!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
IDENTIFIED AS...MARIO!

ALERT! REPORT TO BOSS!
ALERT!
ALERT!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm...
I sense danger here...

All adventures are dangerous,
though, so what of it?
We must press on toward the
glory of an unknown treasure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaaaah!!!


What's wrong with this rock?
It sank right into the lava!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please...er...after you.
Do go ahead, old boy.
Rather stifling in here...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My finely honed intuition tells me
that great discoveries lie just
beyond here...

But there's this mysterious block
in the way. Curses!
What to do...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmmm...
There must be some way...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! Excellent! Now, Mario!
No time to hang about!
Onward to glory!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm?
It smells like treasure!
Treasure, old boy! Make way--
I'm going ahead!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
GyaaaaaAAAaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Er... Don't mind me, Mario. Just
investigating this floor a bit
more closely. You go on ahead.

Oh, my aching...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
Wai... Wait one moment!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huff huff huff..

According to the information I've
gathered...

the hidden treasure should be
right around here. But I need to
go a little farther!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aiigh!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Barely nicked me...old boy...
Oh...my poor shell...ow...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good show, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Treasure, old chap! Treasure!!

I can almost taste it!

I tell you, the moment when you
find the treasure is without a
doubt the finest moment in
archaeology.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Close! So very close!!
My treasure-hunting senses are
going simply mad right now!

My intuition tells me...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's over here!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
MARIO STILL APPROACHING!

IDENTIFIED AS SEARCHING FOR 
STAR SPIRIT!

CODE RED! REPORT TO BOSS!

ALERT!
ALERT!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Huh?
There seems to be nothing...

Alas...
Even my finely honed intuition
can be wrong on occasion.

I shall not give up.
Let's head back the other way.
Perhaps the treasure is a bit
deeper down in the volcano.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Success is bought with failures.
Don't look so down, old boy!
Perhaps the treasure is a bit
deeper down in the volcano.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
BLECK HYUCK HYUCK YUCK!
YOU MADE IT, MARIO!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
YOU GUYS...BAD GUYS!
BAD GUYS COME TO STEAL STAR
SPIRIT!

BAD GUYS WHO COME TO STEAL
STAR SPIRITS GET HURT!
WE DON'T LET IT HAPPEN! NO!

WE TRAP STAR SPIRIT!
WE GET THIS VOLCANO!
VOLCANO IS OURS! GOOD DEAL!

WE MAKE THINGS HOT FOR YOU!
WE BEAT YOU, MARIO!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! You shan't fight alone!
Kolorado to the rescue!

Hii-yaaaaaaah!!!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow ow OW!! HOT!!!!
Oh, it burns! Really!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So sorry, old chap, but that's all
I can do at the moment!
Good luck with all this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well! That's that, then!
Now there's nothing between us
and some treasure, eh?
Let's go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The treasure doesn't seem to be
anywhere around here...
Gad, where could it be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
this way! We must hurry!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah ha! Treasure!!
...Er, no, it's...

...some sort of starfish...???
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmmm. This won't do.
The adventure's never over until
the treasure is found!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! Yes, of course!
Perhaps that horrible fiery
monster had it and was hiding it
somewhere! Yes, that's it!

I'll just run back and check.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm... Hmm?
What's this trembling, then?!

...Probably nothing!
Kids with fireworks, no doubt.
Now, after that treasure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No! Wait!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yaaargh! HOT!! So hot!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thuh... that's lava, isn't it?
It's coming near! We must flee!

N... Nooo!
The treasure is still here!
I just know it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
This volcano is going to erupt
any time now.

It's far too dangerous to go
back the way you came.
We have to escape another way!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I feel a slight wind coming from
this cracked wall...
There could be a room beyond.

Mario,
can you blow up this wall?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!! Old chap!
We should forget the treasure!

I'm of the mind that perhaps we
should escape with our lives.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now! Hurry!
We must get out of here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, hurry!
The lava is getting higher!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! I knew it!
At last! The treasure is right
there!

So close... Can't resist...
By the Stars, I'll risk my life
for that treasure!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My treasure! Noooooooo!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What ho...?
Now who might that be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ho ho ho ho! Up here, son!

They call me Wise Wisterwood.
I am the oldest tree here in
Flower Fields, the land of trees,
flowers, grasses and plants.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

And you must be Mario.
I've heard a lot about you, son.

You're trying your best to save
the Star Spirits and the rest of
your world, aren't you?

Very noble. If that is true, then
your arrival means a Star Spirit
is here in our land.

I would help you in your quest,
but alas...

I cannot right now.
Flower Fields is in trouble.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A creature named Huff N. Puff
and his followers invaded our
fair land not long ago.

These creatures brought clouds
to our sunny sky. It has been
dark and cloudy ever since.

The sun doesn't even bother to
rise in the sky anymore.
We are all weak and fading...

Oh! I remember something!
The rumor is that Huff N. Puff
is holding somebody captive...

Of course!
It must be the Star Spirit that
you're searching for!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Oh ho?
You're going to defeat the
wicked Huff N. Puff, then?

Well, that would make the wishes
of Flower Fields come true...

But it's not that easy.
Huff N. Puff is up in the sky, on
what we call the Cloudy Climb.
There's no way up there now.

Well, 
...You might be able to reach it
if you find a Magical Bean or
something that grows high...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now, wait a minute...

I think there IS a flower that
has a Magical Bean...somewhere.

Umm... I believe...
Her name is Petunia.

Perhaps she is off to the east.
It wouldn't hurt to go visit her
and ask about it.

The other flowers and Bub-ulbs
around here might have some
useful information, as well.
I'd say talk to everyone!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank you, Mario. You did a
tree-mendous job.

You cleared off those clouds so
the sun could rise once more.

It's so nice seeing my dear
Flower Fields full of light again
after such a long time.
There's nothing like sunlight!

Oh yes, of course!
You should plant that Magical
Bean, don't you think?
It should grow well now. 

I'd say the best place for you
to plant it would be over there
where you can see the soil.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

If you want to plant the bean,
the best place is that patch
where you can see the soil.

Hurry up and plant it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ho now! What are you doing?
Haven't you ever grown a plant?

When you're planting something,
the order is soil, then the bean,
then water.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Soil!
Bean!!
Then water!!!

...That's the only way!
Come on, now. You can do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ho ho ho! Success!

Look at that sprout! Now you
can go up to Cloudy Climb.
Best of luck, son.

...Hmmm. My spot seems to be
getting less and less sunny.

...How disappointing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Congratulations, young Mario!
You saved the Star Spirit!

Because of your efforts, Flower
Fields is beautiful again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you, Mario.
It was worth living so long to
meet a man of your stature.

Please come and see me again.
I'll be looking forward to it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What ho...?
What is it, son?
Do you need something?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

If a bean is what you seek, you
ought to ask Petunia if she'll
give one to you.

Petunia's hobby is collecting
rare beans and seeds.

She has this and that and then
some other things...and she likely
has a Magical Bean.

That particular bean definitely
is the best one...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Have you met Posie, by chance?
She's a wonderful flower.

The soil is very nutritious and
rich where she is.

As a result, Posie's flowers
always grow and grow...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

The spring water that flows
where Lily the Flower Spirit
grows is so refreshing.

Is that spring still gushing?
I wonder how Lily's doing...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

The lack of sunshine completely
robs us of our vigor.

If these clouds continue, we'll
all likely wither up.

If only I could move around...
I'd take a journey to the Sun
Tower to cheer the sun up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, Mario.
Huff N. Puff is on Cloudy Climb.

You can reach Cloudy Climb by
riding on the leaf of the Bean
Stalk that you grew.

Teach Huff N. Puff a lesson!
Please! We're all relying on you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Thank you from the bottom of my
trunk, Mario.

It was worth living so long to
meet a man of your stature.

Please come and see me again.
I'll be looking forward to it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What ho...?
What is it, son?
Do you need something?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Thanks to you, everyone in
Flower Fields can live in peace.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You want to meet Petunia?
That flower seems a little
strange to me, you know.

She collects beans and seeds,
but she never grows them.

She just likes seeds.
I call her the Seed Maniac.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that some of the trees
in Flower Fields drop berries if
you hit them hard enough.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that some of the trees
in Flower Fields drop berries if
you hit them hard enough.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you met Mr. Sun before?

I heard that Mr. Sun lives on top
of the Sun Tower.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The light of the sun
is back--ooh, yeah!
Feels good, so good, uh huh!!

Flower flower shower power
shoo-bee-do-waa ooo-waaaa
Dooo waaa!♪

I feel like singing and dancing
all day long!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Rosie and Lily are always
arguing about which one of them
is more beautiful.

They're both beautiful!
Why compare?!

Every flower is beautiful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Petunia?
The Seed Maniac, Petunia? The
one who collects seeds like a
crazy flower?

I know her. She's growing due
east from here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are so many beautiful
flowers in Flower Fields.

It would be a mistake to judge
them by their beauty, though.
Not all of them are gentle
flowers, that's for sure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lily is very beautiful, but I've
heard that she's more than a
little bit strange.

They say she always floats in
the water, dreaming of things
that could never happen.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mr. Sun can't rise because so
many clouds are in the way.

He used to be burning hot, but
now he's cooled way down.

I've never heard of a sun that
wasn't burning hot before.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, the sun's back!
He's burning hot again!

Way to go, Mr. Sun!
Everything's back to normal!

Just gimme my soil, water, and
sun and I'll be happy.
I don't need anything else.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, the sun's back!
He's burning hot again!

Way to go, Mr. Sun!
Everything's back to normal!

Just gimme my soil, water, and

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've heard rumors about many
flowers, but I've never heard
any rumors about me. 

What do they think of me?
Are they talking about me? 

I wonder how it would feel to be
the center of attention all the
time... 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sick of this weather. Flower
Fields is always cloudy.

It never used to be like this.
That Huff N. Puff's the cause!

Plants like us can't live long
without the light of the sun.

Everybody around here is losing
hope and starting to wither...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Every plant needs good soil in
order to grow big and healthy.

The more nutritious the soil is,
the bigger plants can grow.

And then, plants that grow
really big give nutrition back!
They drop their leaves, and the
leaves become fertilizer.

We grew with the nutrition of
Wise Wisterwood's fallen leaves.

So Wise Wisterwood is kind of
like our father, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you seen the Crystal Tree
near Posie's place yet?

I've heard that tree bears the
most wonderful berries...

If you believe what folks say,
those berries are the most
beautiful things in the world.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Without beautiful sunlight, we
plants are doomed.

We can't live in Flower Fields
if it's always cloudy. 

I never thought I'd start
withering at such a young age! 

I wish I were blanketed in warm,
rejuvenating sunlight like I used
to be...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, the land's full of sunlight! I
wish I could kiss this whole world
right now!

As long as I have sunlight like
this on me, I could live here for
the rest of my life.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, the land's full of sunlight! I
wish I could kiss this whole world
right now!

As long as I have sunlight like
this on me, I could live here for
the rest of my life.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello there!
How are you?

Are you enjoying the sunshine as
much as I am?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The sun can't come up because
a thick cloud is completely
covering the sky.

We Bub-ulbs can live just about
anywhere if there's sun, but now
there's none at all!

I'm not saying that having some
clouds is bad. Of course not!

But there should be some gaps
for a little precious sunshine!

Sigh... I hate that stupid cloud.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Without sunlight, the seeds we
have can't sprout, and we can't
make any new ones, either.

If the sun never rises again, all
of Flower Fields will wither up
completely.

Do you have any ideas?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you looking for water?
You might try Lily's spring.

But if you want water to plant
something, it's hopeless. 
There's no use planting now. 

Even if you water them, plants
won't grow without the sun.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You mean you're thinking of
doing something to that thick
cloud so the sun can rise again?

You think that'll work?
Oh, it would be so nice if the sun
rose up again!

I hope your plan works...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's the sun!
The sun has come out!
I knew you could do it!

It's all because of you!
I can't believe I made it through
those sad, cloudy days!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, are you still on that
dangerous adventure?

I can't stand that Huff N. Puff.
What a mean guy!
He loves clouds. And he loves
that we hate them!

Please, could you beat him?
I hope you really stick it to him
and save the Star Spirit!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now I'm going to grow and grow
and produce lots and lots of
cute little seeds!

You know, Mario, as long as
you're around, I think the
world's going to be OK. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How're you doing, Lakilester?

Are you becoming a better
Lakitu by helping people? Hmm?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Darn it, I told you not to call
me Lakilester!

Gah! You never listen to me!

...But that's why you're so cute.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please take care of Lakilester.
He acts like he's really tough,
but he's a bit of a pushover.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, guy! Where you going?

Oh, Petunia...?

Yeah, Petunia's straight west
from here. Yup. West.
...Heh heh heh heh...

Sorry, guy, I can't tell you any
more, not even if you ask.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mr. Big Shot! You looking
for something?

The only thing that Posie's got
is soil, guy. Just soil. Yup. 

She definitely doesn't have
anything beautiful. No way.

...Pfff...ha ha ha...

Sorry, guy, I can't tell you any
more, not even if you ask.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mr. High and Mighty!
Great weather, isn't it?
An ideal day for gardening!

You know, it's the perfect
season for growing giant bean-
stalks. They're simple!

All you need's a Magical Bean,
some soil, and some water.

Yeah, that's it. You don't need
anything else at all. Nothing.

Heh heh heh...

Sorry, guy, I can't tell you any
more, not even if you ask.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Super Star! Lemme fill you
in on something!

You can get yourself one fine
gift if you hit the three trees
in a row in this order:
left, right, then middle. Yup.

Hee hee hee...
It's true! I swear!

Oops, I've told you too much!
No more secrets out of me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you! Everybody's hero! You
want to know the inside scoop on
something good?

If you find a well in the place
with lots of dead trees, you can
throw something in it to get a
cool reward.

Whatever you do, though, don't
throw in a Blue Berry!

Ha ha ha! Yeah! I'm serious! 
Do you believe me? Huh? Do you
believe me? Do you?

I've also gotta tell you... Oops,
sorry. Everything else is a
secret. Sorry, guy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, guy! By the way, do you
even know what my name is?
They call me Tolielip.

I personally think it's kind of a
rude name.
I mean, I never lie! Never!

...Heh heh heh, ha ha ha!!
Wah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!
Baaaaah ha ha ha ha!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, stranger...
What do you think of my bright
red coloring? Isn't it nice?

What's that? You want to pass
through here?
Ha ha ha... No, I'm sorry. I
couldn't possibly let you through.

Although, perhaps I could make
an exception if you gave me
something delicious to eat...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You don't want to give me
anything, is that how it is?
Then sorry, but no.
You can't go through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chomp chomp munch chomp...

Aw, yuck!!!
Disgusting! That was awful!

No way you're going through!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Munch munch munch...

Ummm... I really don't like this
type of berry at all.
You'd better get me a better
flavor, or you can't go through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Munch chomp smack...

Ooh, delicious! This is it! Great
color! Full flavor! It's perfect!

You're a champ for bringing me
such a tasty snack.
Of course you can go through!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Go on through!♥
For you, the gate's always open!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, genuinely nice people
are really hard to find.

I've put many different people
to the test since I've been here,
and you're the nicest.

If you keep doing good deeds, I
bet you'll go through many gates
as you travel!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good day, Mario! It's great to
see you.

I'm the guard of this gate.
I must tell you, though, I don't
let many people through.

I have excellent taste in foods,
so you must bring me something
sufficiently tasty to get by.

Well...? Do you have anything?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, nothing tasty, eh?
Well, that's unfortunate...

I understand it's hard to meet
the standards of such a
cultured flower as me.
I suppose you weren't up to it.

Sadly, it also means you can't
pass through here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chomp smack chomp...

Haaaaack! Pbbbbth!

What is this garbage!?
This is decidedly substandard!
I'm a connoisseur!

It's downright ungentlemanly to
eat anything but berries while
in Flower Fields!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Munch chomp munch...

Ummm, well...
It's not bad, I suppose.

But it's not enough to satisfy a
gourmet such as me.

I'm sorry, but I never let people
without distinguished taste
pass through here.

Come back with some culture.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Munch chomp chomp...

Bravo!!
Magnificent!!

A sweet, subtle flavor with a
delicate finish!

And such marvelous coloring!
It reminds me of the warm
sunlight I so yearn for.

I'm truly taken aback by your
cultured taste!
Of course you may go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sir, your taste is flawless!

You may use this gate as if it
were your own front door. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's always a pleasure to meet
people with wonderful taste.

And here I was thinking that
there were no more cultured
people left in the world!

Bravo!! Scintillating! Let's hear
it for incredible snobbery and
fine culture!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ahhh, I'm so hungry...

I'm tired of guarding this stupid
old gate...
I'm so, so hungry...

Hey! You there! I don't suppose
you have anything good to eat
that you'd like to give me?

Listen, if you give me something
succulent I'll let you through
here, and I won't tell anybody...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nothing? Not even a bite?
Aw, shoot...
Then I can't let you go through.

I'm sitting here starving, and
you won't even spare a lousy...

Ever since the sun disappeared,
nothing's gone right for me.
I feel so blue...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chomp smack munch...

Oh, bleah!!!

This is totally icky!
Listen, I can't eat anything but
berries from around here.

Yeah, I guess maybe I should
have told you that first, huh?
Stupid old me.

Now I feel even more blue...
Please...just leave me alone.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Munch chomp crunch...

As far as berries go, it's so-so.
But it's missing...something.

Nothing tastes good. I've been
blue since the sun disappeared.
I hate being a blue flower.

Nothing good is blue. Yeah, you
heard me! Nothing! I bet even
Blue Berries taste disgusting
because...they're blue!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Blue Berry?
I'm sure this'll be gross.
Munch chomp munch...

Oh, how delicious!♪
Such a splendid taste!

There ARE good blue things! 
I'm filled with hope again!

Go! Go and never feel blue!
I'll never forget you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Head through there!
I'll never forget you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Blue is a nice color, or so I've
begun to think lately.

Has the sun changed my opinion?
Or do I owe it to you, Mario?

Oh, yeah! You've got a little blue
in your outfit, too!
Ha ha ha! You and I match!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you have a second?
Then listen to my sad tale!

Ever since the sun went away,
I've begun to droop...
I have no energy at all.

Without the sun, it just seems
like the whole world is sad.

Now these Monty Moles dig into
the ground and bite my roots!
Oh, woe is me!

My beautiful seed collection will
become a Monty Mole banquet if
this keeps up...

Please, sir...
You look strong and capable.
Could you get rid of those Monty
Moles for me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In case you're wondering, the
Monty Moles I'm talking about
are...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
this guy...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
and this jerk...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
and this troublemaker...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
and this wicked creature!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This guy is...
Well, you probably don't need
to be concerned with that one.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please don't fail me!
My seeds and I are counting on
you to save us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are still Monty Moles left!
Please don't desert me!

I can't tell you how horrible it
feels to have Monty Moles biting
at my roots in this dark place!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yiipppeee!!
Hooray! Hurrah! Yahoo! Whee!
You got rid of the Monty Moles!

Oh, thank you! Thank you!!

To show you how grateful I am,
I'll give you this Magical Bean!
Here you are!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm? Yes, my name is Petunia.
They call me the Seed Maniac.
Hee hee! Nice to meet you.♥

By the way, about that Magical 
Bean that I gave you...
You shouldn't plant it.

Why not?
Because as a seed, it will always
enjoy freedom!

After it's planted and it
sprouts up, it won't ever be able
to move again.

Don't you think that's sad?

Please don't plant it with, oh,
for instance, Fertile Soil and
Miracle Water!

I don't want to think about a
sprout growing out of my cute
little seed!


No!!!!!!!!!




———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you really going to plant
my Magical Bean?

Oh...sigh...OK.
I've already given it to you.
It's your choice.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
After basking in this lovely sun
for a while, I've noticed...
that it feels good to grow!

Even though I can't move, I'm
completely happy right here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It feels so good to grow in the
warm sunlight!

Even though I can't move, I'm
completely happy right here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It feels so good to grow in the
warm sunlight!

Even though I can't move, I'm
completely happy right here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi! My name's Bubble Plant!
You wanna know why my name's
Bubble Plant?

I'll tell you if you give me a
Bubble Berry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi! I'm Bubble Plant!

I'll show you how cool my Bubble
is if you give me a Bubble Berry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, awesome! Good going!

OK!
Get a load of this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ummmm... Hrrrrrrrrr......

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There! Isn't it great?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You don't have a Bubble Berry?
Not even one? 
That's too bad.
You're really missing out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at this Crystal Tree.
Have you ever seen anything so
beautiful in all the world?

...Oh, excuse me.
I forgot to introduce myself.
My name is Posie.

Hm? What's wrong with my mouth?
This is my nose! Oh, how rude!

Anyway, it was this Fertile Soil
that made my nose grow so long.
I happen to like it! Hee hee...

Your nose is pretty nice, too.

It could stand to be a little bit
longer, so why don't you take
this Fertile Soil with you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your nose'll be perfect soon!
...Hee hee hee...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch!
Be gentle with this tree!

The tree and I are connected at
the roots, so it hurts me when
you hit the tree.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh? Rosie told you to bring her
something beautiful?

Rosie really loves beautiful
things above all else.
She's a little self-involved.
Have you noticed?

You really need help, huh?
OK, I'll help you.

This tree and I are connected
by our roots,

so maybe one or two Crystal
Berries will fall down if I shake
the root.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm... Rrrrrrghh......

Hyahhhhhhh!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew...

...Oops.
That was a bit unladylike.
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!

Rosie should be more than
satisfied with that berry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch! That hurts!

What's the matter with you?
I gave you a Crystal Berry,
didn't I?

Don't tell me that you want
another one!
You shouldn't be so greedy.

Do you think it was easy shaking
that root? I can't just do it
over and over!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Youch ouch ouch!!!
Don't you hear me...OUCH!!

...Ooh, I shouldn't be so loud.
Hee hee hee hee.

Please don't hit the tree!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch! What're you...OW!
Stop it! I...OUCH! OUCH!

I said stop it!! Aren't you
listening to me?

Don't ever come here again!!
Do you understand me?! Out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't come back here!!!
Get out and stay out!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sigh... You keep coming back...
You've got guts.
I like that!

I guess you can keep hitting the
tree if that's what you want...

But you're not going to get any
more Crystal Berries by hitting
the tree, so quit it!

...Get ahold of yourself, Posie.
You're losing control.

Hee hee hee hee hee hee...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What do you think? Pretty, no?
Gorgeous and fascinating!

Hee hee hee! Who, me?
No, not me. I'm talking about
this Crystal Tree.

It grew from a seed that
Petunia gave me a long time ago.

The soil here is so fertile that
the tree grew this big.

Petunia has a lot of rare seeds,
but she never plants them.

What a waste, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good soil, clear water and ample
sun will generally produce a
wonderful flower.

But there isn't any sun in Flower
Fields right now.

I'm afraid that it'll be impossible
for plants to grow.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You and I are... plant pals!♥
...Hee hee hee!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Rosie wanted that Crystal
Berry, didn't she?

Shouldn't you give it to her?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Rosie liked the Crystal Berry?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

That Rosie's so selfish. All she
cares about is beauty.

Even though Flower Fields is in
terrible trouble, she only cares
about how she might make herself
more beautiful.

It's appalling, really.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now that the sun has returned,
the Crystal Tree and I are
filled with new life.

I heard that it's all because of
you. Thank you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Petunia heard that I planted
the Crystal Tree, but she wasn't
angry at all! Weird!

I wonder who changed her view?
Maybe you did... 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no!!! The spring....
The spring went dry!

Why!? What for? And why?
What'll I do?! What can I do?
I don't know!! Who does?!

I can't think of a thing! I'm all
over the place!
Be cool, Lily! Be cool, Lily!
Be cool and cruel!

Gaaaaah!!
Being cruel won't do anything!!
You're a fool, Lily!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gaaah!! Oh, how horrible!
The spring went dry!

What a tragedy... Oh!
This can't happen to me!
No, it can't! Not to Lily!

Somebody! The horrible thing
that rides the clouds...took our
precious Water Stone!

Water flows from that magical
Water Stone...

Without it, the spring will never
recover...

Oh! And I'll wither up if I can't
float on the water!

I'll be crushed by my own weight
and wither... Poor Lily!

Oh, no! Don't give up, Lily!

Perhaps a handsome prince will
arrive and help you soon...!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...............................................
Oh......!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A prince... Well, he actually looks
more like a plumber, but beggars
can't be choosers!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, my name is Lily.
I'm a beautiful, fragile flower
who lives in this spring.

Um... To tell the truth, I have to
ask you to do me a favor. 

Could you please get my Water
Stone back from that horrible
cloud creature?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, you're a dream come true!
Thank you so much!

{Water Stone}
 The Water Stone looks
 just like this.


Please find it!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, how awful...
You weren't my prince...

Well...I knew you must not be.
...After all, you don't look
anything like a prince...

{Water Stone}
 In case you care,
 the Water Stone looks
 like this.


If you find it somewhere, please
bring it to me!

I'm withering as we speak!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... I feel terrible.
My condition will only get worse
if the spring's water never
comes back.

Am I being punished for being
too pretty...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's the Water Stone! 

Quickly!
Put it in that hole there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What? Why won't you put the
Water Stone back and fix the
spring? Huh?

You're a...flower hater!
I hope you dry up! I hope your
petals all fall off!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, it's water! Sweet water!!

The spring is full of water.
I'm floating again...
Oh, this is paradise...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you so very much! I'll give
you some Miracle Water from this
spring.
Here you are!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the most nourishing
water around! It's water with
a little Lily extract!♥ 

If you use this Miracle Water
on any plant, it'll grow like
gangbusters!

...Uh...but not right now.
Because there's no sun...

Oh, yes! Great idea!
You should go see about getting
the sun back into the sky.

A resourceful guy like you must
have some idea about how to get
the sun back up again!

I bet you'll do it!♥
You saved me, after all!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The water in the spring is back
to normal. Aaaaah!
It feels so good to float...

But if the sun doesn't come up,
we'll all wither up anyway.

Oh...that'd be terrible.
If only I could go all the way to
the Sun Tower and give the sun
a little support...

Nobody ever thinks of the sun's
feelings... It's probably sad!

Oh, Lily, you're so caring!
I could almost cry!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The sun is shining. And I am
floating.
Oh..., I'm... so... happy!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Some sort of pink gem seems to
be floating on the water. Is it
the tear of an angel?
No, it's not.

Her name is Lily.
She's a beautiful, tragic flower
fated to be unhappy.

See the reflection of her face?
She wears a brave smile...

...but if you remove the veil of
petals one by one, you'll find
Lily's soul is wet with tears. 

Don't cry, Lily.
Crying will never free you from
the bonds of this spring...
It's no use...

Unless perhaps you cry so much
that all of Flower Fields is
flooded and you can swim free...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Where'd you drop it, idiot?
Huff N. Puff will have our clouds
if we don't find it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ohhhh, man, I'm so clumsy...
That stone gave out an endless
supply of water! Without it,

we can't increase the power of
the Puff Puff Machine! 

It's just gotta be around here
somewhere! It's just gotta be!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...What?
Is that... Mario?
Look, man, it's Mario!

Let's look for the stone later.
Let's go rough this dude up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! Mario? Are you sure?
I'm not sure I'm, you know, in
the right mental state...

Aw, forget it! I'll fight anyway!
Here it comes, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hello.
It seems like ages since I last
saw a visitor here.

I'm Rosie, a Rose Spirit.
I'm ever so glad to meet you.

Here I am in full bloom, and
there's nobody to look at me.

Please, admire me all you like.
Breathtaking, aren't I?
Aren't I just incredible?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Really? I'm that beautiful?
You're so honest and charming.
And underneath that scruffy
mustache, I bet you're handsome.

I like you. And because I like
you, I'll show you this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, you don't think so?
Tee hee hee...
You don't have to be so coy.

I can tell you're too shy to
compliment me to my face...

OK, then praise this instead.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This stone! Isn't it beautiful?
I found it just the other day.

Some strange creatures on
clouds dropped it.

I couldn't resist its gorgeous
glitter, so I made it mine.
I could look at it all day...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This stone makes me look even
more beautiful, if that's
possible.

Go on, you can look at me! I'm
used to people staring in wonder
at my beauty.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
What did you say?
I should give you this stone?

Oh dear... You're saying Lily's
in trouble without this?

...How very sad. Oh, well. It
can't be helped.
The stone is mine now, you see?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You mean Lily will wither up
without this stone?

Huh... How sad... Really...
How very pitiful...

As hard as it is to believe,
that Lily sometimes acts like
she's prettier than I am. 

She's dumb, but she's not evil.
And if she's gone, there'll be
no flowers to set off my beauty.

...Let's see. Tell you what...

If you bring me something more
beautiful than this stone, I'll
think about trading it. 

So let's wait 'til then!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You'd better bring something
more beautiful in a hurry,
before I change my mind.

My beauty may never change, but
my mind easily does.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you found anything?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, how pretty! I love it!
That's much nicer than this ugly
old stone.

You'd better hurry back and
give this stone to Lily.

Make sure she knows that she
was saved because of me!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...♥ Such loveliness...
I've gotten so beautiful that
I'm starting to scare myself!♥

Who is the most beautiful flower
in all of Flower Fields?
That is me, of course!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, did you come back to gaze
spellbound at my beauty?
Go on. You may ogle just as long
as you like.

It's my job to bloom beautifully.

And, I must admit, I'm incredibly
good at my job.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The sunlight glittering on this
Crystal Berry is really quite
striking, you know.

I love all things beautiful!

And yet, no one realizes how
hard it is to be so gorgeous...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!♥ You've come all the way
back to look at me again?♥

Tell me again how I'm the most
beautiful flower in the world!

I'm prettier than Posie and Lily.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey... Hello.
I never thought anybody would
come all the way up here.

I'm the sun.
No... That's not entirely true.
I should say, I WAS the sun.

The clouds that came out of the 
Puff Puff Machine that Huff N.
Puff built... 

Those clouds keep me from
climbing into the sky.

I'm a complete failure as a sun.
All of those flowers and plants
in Flower Fields are suffering...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where is it? You mean the Puff
Puff Machine?

I think it's east of here. The
clouds seem to come from over
there, anyway.

Why do you want to know?
Do you think you can break the
Puff Puff Machine?

Naw...there's no way...
Don't strain yourself. You might
as well go home.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where is it? You mean the Puff
Puff Machine?

I think it's east of here. The
clouds seem to come from over
there, anyway.

If those clouds were gone, I
could rise right into the sky and
bathe all the poor plants with
sunshine...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey!!!
I heard that you're the guy who
broke the Puff Puff Machine!

Thank you so much!
Thanks to you, Flower Fields has
blue skies again.

And I can shine once more!

Speaking of shining, I'd better
get back up into the sky! All
those flowers are waiting!

See you! Bye!
Good luck!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey... We meet again!

Hey, did you know?
The sun is the sun only when it
rises to light the skies.

Today I am once more spreading
sunshine, so I can be called
Mr. Sun again.

Anyway, see you! Good luck!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey hey hey! Hold up!
Wait, man!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, man!
I don't think we've ever met,
have we?
I mean, you're Mario, right?

My name is Lakilester...
Er, no,
it's Michael... No, um...

Oh, yeah...
Spike.
Yeah yeah, I'm Spike...
Well, whatever. Never mind.

Look, I don't have a problem
with you personally, but I've
got orders from Huff N. Puff.

Sorry, man, but I have to give
you a bit of a beat down.
Like I said, man, sorry!

(...Did I sound cool?)
(Ha... Yeah, totally cool!)

Here it comes, man!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uuurgh!!
Man, you're tough as nails!
I give up, man!

Go on...do your worst.
I'm not afraid of it.

Do whatever you do to guys
you've defeated...Fire Flower
in the eye...POW Block...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wait!!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw no, Lakilulu!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No! Please!
Please have mercy on my poor,
sweet Lakilester!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, don't call me Lakilester!

It's Spike, remember?
I told you I changed my name
last month! C'mon now!

Man... I mean, gee whiz...
You're always embarrassing me
like this...

Although...for some reason it
makes me like you even more...

I mean, what? No!!
Did I say that out loud? Forget
that I said that!

...Anyway!
I lost a challenge man-to-man,
so we have to settle this.

I have to face the music.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, please forgive him!

My Lakilester was just following
Huff N. Puff's orders!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

He's really sweet! Please don't
take my sweetie away from me!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Really!? Oh, for real?
You'll forgive him? Oh, thank you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stop calling me Lakilester! It's
such a stupid name! My name is
Spike! SPIKE! Don't you ever
listen to me?

Sigh..........
I'm beginning to think that this
whole deal is stupid.

I was working for Huff N. Puff
to be part of something big, but
all I've been doing is picking
pointless fights...

This isn't what I wanted in life.
What I wanted was....
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, man. I've got a question.
What in the world are you doing
all this fighting for?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

....Huh.
Yeah...fighting for yourself...

That's the way to go, man.
Walkin' your own path with honor.

I can get behind an ideal like
that! I'll go with you!

I'm completely fed up with the
pointless jobs that Huff N. Puff
threw my way, anyway.

With you, I can improve my skills
by taking on the enemies that
challenge us along the way!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

World peace, huh? Isn't that a
bit melodramatic?

Still, I must admit there's a
certain manly charm to having
such a noble purpose...

Yeah! That's the way to go! I'm
going with you, man!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Man, you're a cool customer.
You're out there every day
risking life and limb just
because you feel like it?

Wow. Talk about a tough guy. 

You know what? I wanna fight
just because I feel like it!
I'm going with you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Why? Because Spike is a million
times cooler! Lakilester is the
dumbest name ever!

It just doesn't fit the image
of a dangerous rebel like me.

The name doesn't matter, man!
What matters is this...

I've decided I'm going with you!
You're the real deal!
Traveling around with you has
gotta be as cool as it gets!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no! Lakilester!
You can't leave me!
Please take me with you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, Lakilulu, chill out.
You've gotta understand...
I'm doing this for you, don't you
see?

I'm going. I've gotta be a man!

Wait for me! I'll return a much
more manly Lakitu!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Oh...OK.
I'll wait for you, Lakilester.

But you'll be so sorry if you
don't come back to me in one
piece!

I swear, if you make me worry,
I'll take a Spiny and...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK! Enough of that! Heh heh...

I guess I'd better make sure I'm
tougher than you by the time I
come back, huh?

See me off with a smile, now!
You're so much cuter when you
show me those pearly whites!

Bye for now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, my Lakilester!! 
Come back to me soon!!
I'll be waiting with a smile!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aghhhhhh!! Come ON!
Call me Spike!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's go!! C'mon!
We need more clouds! I wanna
see this land covered!

We'll make them fear the power
of my Puff Puff Machine!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Go away!
Don't disturb me!
I'm completely absorbed in my
work right now, can't you see?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huff N. Puff is making a name
for himself as an evil genius.

This cloud-covering scheme is
pretty high on the wicked scale.
I bet King Bowser's overjoyed at
the suffering we're causing.

Don't you think so, too?

...Oh, my... You're...!
Mario! You're a wanted man!

C'mon, Lakitus, get him!
Protect the Puff Puff Machine
at all costs!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Stop that!
The Puff Puff Machine is
extremely delicate!

You might break it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I said don't hit it!

Don't you realize that if the
Puff Puff Machine breaks, we
won't be able to make clouds,
and blue skies will return?

You think it's easy to fill the
sky with clouds?

...Oh, my...
You're... Ma... Ma... Mario!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ahhhh, retreat, boys!!
He beat us, but good!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
♪ Aw, fluffy fluffy 
Great Puff Puff Machine,
spewing out the clouds,

making brown outta green!
Wither 'em all up! Yeah!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Quit it!
Leave me alone, man!
Can't you see I'm busy working
right now?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Master Huff N. Puff is the man
with the plan, all right.

I mean, I love clouds. Love 'em.
And so covering the world in
clouds seems pretty cool to me.

How about you? You like clouds?

...Eeeek! You're...
...that wanted man! Mario!

You guys, it's Mario!
We've gotta get him before he
breaks the Puff Puff Machine!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! What're you doing!
The Puff Puff Machine's 
delicate, man. Didn't you know?

If you break it, we're gonna be
in a world of hurt!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Didn't you hear me? Stop it!

If you break that machine, how
are we supposed to keep filling
the sky with clouds, huh? You
ever think of that, genius?

You think clouds just appear out
of thin air or something?

....Wait a minute...
You're... Ma... Ma... Mario!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Baah ha ha! Look at those
chumps run away!

All right! Now, Mario...
We'd better do something about
this Puff Puff Machine, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, hold up, man.
You're just going to walk away
from this Puff Puff Machine?
Then what did we fight for?

Don't you think we ought to
break it or something?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!
The clouds are gone! It's time
for a little sunshine!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, precious sunlight!
Ho ho ho ho ho!!!

Mario did it! He saved Flower
Fields!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ohhh, yes!! The sun!!!
Yay! Yippee!! The sun's back!!!

Oops... Tee hee hee!
Losing control like that...
It's so unlike me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah, the bright rays of the sun...
Once again I can gaze at the
sparkles of light on the water...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ohh, it's about time. The sun!
Flower Fields is saved!

And, of course, the sunlight can
only add to my beauty...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the sun, it's the sun!!!!!
Oh, that heat feels so good!

Maybe being stuck in one place
isn't so bad after all.
I feel full of life again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Helping folks feels...good!
I could get used to this, man.

Mario, what are you doing next?
I'll follow you anywhere.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you a man named Mario? And
did you or did you not break one
Puff Puff Machine?

What possessed you to do that?
You completely ruined my plan to
cover Flower Fields in clouds.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You see, I was going to turn this
sunlight-blasted place into a
cloud-covered paradise.

But I can't expect a man of
your intellect to understand...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I must tell you, King Bowser
ordered me to defeat you if you
showed your face...

but I'd take you down even if
it weren't a direct order!

You cloud-destroying pest!
You can't save the Star Spirit!

Gahh ha ha ha ha ha!!!
Here comes the storm!


———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is that you, Spike?!
So! You have betrayed me!

You will be punished.

I was given this Star Spirit by
King Bowser. I'll never give it up
to the likes of you.

You will both pay dearly for
your crimes!


———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No!! I cannot lose!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Master Huff N. Puff! I wish to
pummel Mario, too!
Permission to attack?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, take him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You asked for it...
Now you'll witness the full power
of my storm!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Master Huff N. Puff!
Leave him to me!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gaaah ha ha ha ha!!!! How do
you like that!?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa!! Master Huff N. Puff, you
are truly the mightiest!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We seem to be in trouble. Hmm...
I guess I'd better stop messing
around and fight hard!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Will you be all right, Master?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're not finished yet!!!
Here I come!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a pleasure meeting you.
My name is Klevar.
Thank you for saving me.

Huff N. Puff is gone, so the
flowers in Flower Fields can live
peacefully once more.

I feel that if you hadn't come,
Flower Fields would never have
seen the light again.

Now there is only one of us
Star Spirits still trapped.
Just one more, Mario!

Here... Please use my Power as
you continue your fight.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now, you are able to use the
Powers of six Star Spirits.

If you use mine well, it should
prove to be extremely helpful in
battle.

Don't become overconfident,
though. You must be careful.
Bowser has power, as well.  

Remember that even stronger
enemies await you...

I hope our Powers will help you
so that you may help us...
We're all depending on you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll go back to Star Haven now.

I can't wait to get there!
I've been terribly worried about
everyone...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sniffle... Sniffle.........
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sniffle...
Who's throwing stuff down into
my well?

Whoever it is, you deserve this
for your rudeness!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sniffle!!!!!
Who's throwing stuff down into
my well?

Huh...?
This is a Blue Berry...

I love these... Thank you... 
I'll give this to you in return.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sniffle!!!!!

Burp... No more berries!
I'm stuffed now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, we have a guest!
Welcome! You poor man, you must
be freezing!

If you'd like to see my husband,
he's in the other room.

Please, go right in.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you'd like to see my husband,
he's in the other room.

Please, go right in.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No reply...
Mayor Penguin's body doesn't
budge an inch.

What's this? He has a memo in his
hand that says, "Herringway."
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No reply...
Mayor Penguin's body doesn't

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Something's inside the box. It's
quite heavy.

What could be inside?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Darling,
would you like a cup of tea?
....... Hmm? 

Oh... Dear, you know you'll catch
a cold if you sleep there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Help! Somebody! Anybody!
My husband is dead!!
He's been murdered!

It's a
penguin murder mystery!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's going on here, madam?

Just calm down, now.
You need to speak slowly so I
can get to the bottom of this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My husband is dead!
Look at him lying there!

Oh, my darling husband!!!
Somebody clipped his flippers!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By puffin, you're right!
The Mayor's been murdered!

This is like a mystery novel!
Except it's real! How tragic! 

But madam, if I may ask...
Who on earth would have reason
to put this penguin on ice?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Him! Right there! That man with
the suspicious mustache!

I told him not to come in the
house, but he barged right in!

My husband was alive right up
until this man showed up!

He must be the murderer!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you... Mustache!
Are you listening?
This good woman's accusing you.
What do you say for yourself?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't try to play ignorant with
me, buddy. I'm a professional.
We've got a witness here.

Isn't that right, madam?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! That's right!
He did it in cold blood!
I, uh...saw it with my own eyes!

Besides, he's the only one who
came into this room!
It all adds up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So you're sticking to your story,
claiming you're not the culprit.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's your problem?
You don't actually think Mario
did it, do you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you crazy?
Do you really think Mario would
do something like that!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't be ridiculous!
Mario didn't do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario didn't do it.
He's obviously innocent!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I was with him the whole time.
I swear on my own grave! Mario's
innocent!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, um, didn't do it!

It's mean that you're treating
him like he's a bad guy, even
though there's no, um, evidence!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, use your head!
Do you really think Mario is
capable of such a thing?
Think about it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What! Are you nuts, man?
Mario's not a murderer! That's
completely ridiculous!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm... If you're telling the
truth, then we're dealing with a
backroom murder case.
Oh, I never trained for this...

A backroom murder case... A
high-ranking penguin slain...

How could such a horrible plot
twist hit our peaceful city?

You! Mr. Mustache! Once more
for the record! You swear you
didn't do this?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK... I think I believe you.
But this means we have to find
the true murderer....... 

Ah! Perfect!

I'll give you a chance.

Since you claim that you're not
the guilty party, then you must
bring me the murderer yourself!

If you do that, I'll believe you.
It's the only way...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, off with you.

You haven't proved that you're
innocent yet, so I must forbid
you to leave the city.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm?
Got any leads yet?

You're still our main suspect, so
I'd advise you to go find the
real criminal. And fast.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You killed him, didn't you?
I knew my instincts were right.

When I saw a stranger like you
out here in such a remote place, I
knew that you must be up to no
good! Oh, the horror!

My poor, poor penguin-kins!
Please forgive me for letting
this murderer in the house!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, you again.
Have you come up with anything?

Hmm...!?

Say, isn't that penguin behind
you the mystery novel writer
named Herringway?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What-what!?
Mayor Penguin was clutching a
piece of paper that had
"Herringway" written on it?

Bah! If that were true, I most
certainly would've noticed it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm... He definitely does
appear to be holding a piece
of paper.

Yes, of course!
It's a message about his death!

With his last breath, the Mayor
told us the murderer's identity!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So... Mr. Herringway...
You cold-hearted murderer!

It all makes sense now!
No wonder your novels are so
exciting and suspenseful!

You live out your own plots!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dear man... Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?
You actually think I would do this
to the Mayor?

He's a great friend of mine!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmm... Yes...
Yes, you were good friends...

Ah ha! But that was just a
cover so that no one would
suspect you of this heinous
crime!

That's it, isn't it? I've solved
this crafty mystery!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, come on. Really.
You simple, simple penguin.
I would never be so predictable.

Besides, I'm completely innocent.
I've been working in my house on
my new novel for weeks.

I didn't have time to sneak over
here to kill Mayor Penguin.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'd just like to say that I still
think the man with the mustache
is the murderer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmmm...
This penguin murder mystery is
getting more intriguing all the
time...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uuhhh...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, my aching... Ouch...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Eeeeeeek!

My husband's returned!
He's a ghost!!! Eeeeek! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, good gracious!
Hello, everyone.

What's going on here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What-what?! Mayor!
We thought you were dead!

Our backroom murder mystery
is a wash! What a plot twist!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh...?
What are you talking about?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Umm....

I think... I seem to remember
going to the shelf to get this
souvenir for Herringway.

Oh, yes, of course!
I reached up, slipped, and then
whacked my head on the floor.
Yes, that's what happened!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here you are, Herringway.
This is what I was reaching for.

Toad Town was great fun.
So many interesting sights... Wish
you could've been there.

Some time after all this hubbub
settles down, I'll give you a full
account of the big city.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well...uh, thank you, old friend.
That's very thoughtful...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But Mayor!
Here we were thinking that you'd
been murdered!

The whole city was up in arms!
Next time be more careful!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah... Yes. So sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha ha! I thought it rather 
entertaining, actually.
Besides, everything's OK now.
The Mayor's just fine.

I must return to my home now.
I believe I've just had an idea
for the sequel to my new novel.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ummm...
I have the best intentions, but
for some reason I always end up
causing a ruckus.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello. Sorry about all that.
I must apologize... 

... Say!
You're Mario, aren't you?
Well, let me welcome you to Shiver
City, jewel of the north!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...What's the matter?
Oh, you want to hike over to
Starborn Valley, do you?

I see... Of course.
I'll tell the gatekeeper to allow
you out of the city.

You'd better bundle up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...I knew you were innocent the
whole time!

A backroom murder case?
Please! How completely silly!

That over-zealous guard must
read too many mystery novels.
Ha ha ha ha ha...aaanyway...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi there! How are you?

Herringway's mystery novels
have become very popular here in
Shiver City, you know.

But when I became a character
in a mystery, I realized that
I'm not so fond of books like
that.

I'm serious. I mean it.
Only penguin poetry for me now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, hello there, Mario!
My husband tells me you're
looking for the Crystal Palace.

What an exciting adventure!
You're like a hero in a novel!

Imagine that, being in a story...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My husband says that you're
preparing to fight Bowser so you
can save Princess Peach.

Ah! It's like a romantic novel!

I'm on your side. I want there to
be a happy ending!
Good luck!

Save the princess!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please come back anytime.

These northern lands aren't
much for scenery, but there's
always plenty of suspense!

Ha ha! Only joking, only joking.
You'll always get a warm welcome
around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
Did you reach Starborn Valley?
Did you see Merle?

... Oh, excellent. He said what?
An item that has been passed
down in this city?

Um... Oh, right! There was
something like that.

Just a minute,
I think I've got it somewhere.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, I found it.
Here it is.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Bucket has been passed
down through the years in
Shiver City.

As Merle must have told you, 
there's a legend associated with
it.

If you use this and the Scarf
together, the way to the Crystal
Palace will open.

Who knows what all that means,
though! Ha ha ha!
I don't have the slightest clue
as to how to use them together.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sounds like those Star Kids in
Starborn Valley are in trouble.

I hope you do your best for the
little tykes. They're just kids.
Best of luck to you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Have you found the way to the
Crystal Palace yet?

Oh... No, huh? Boy, it must be
difficult being a famous
adventurer...

Poor Princess Peach...
If you can't save her, I don't
know who can!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You found the path to the
Crystal Palace!?
That's fantastic!!

That Star Spirit up there is as
good as saved already!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I do believe you've saved
all seven Star Spirits!

Now all you have to do is defeat
Bowser and bring back the Star
Rod so that the world can be
peaceful again.

And all those poor, kidnapped
people can come back!

I wish to the Stars you'll win!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Mayor Penguin of Shiver
City, correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
For me?
Oh... It's from Yoshi Village!
I don't know where that is, but I
bet it's pretty far away.

I'll read this later.
Thanks very much!

Oh, hang on!
I'll give you this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A really shady individual came
to the city recently.

He was screaming at the top of
his lungs and running around...

It was reeeeally odd...
I think something strange is
going on in our peaceful city.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha! I'm not going to help you.

I don't socialize with murderers.
Get away from me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha! I'm not going to help you.

I don't socialize with murderers.
Get away from me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So...you weren't the criminal
after all, huh?
Ha ha ha ha ha... Sorry.

The Mayor's wife raised such a
stink that I believed it.

I'm just happy that the Mayor's
doing fine.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've heard that all the Star 
Spirits made it back to Star
Haven. Fantastic!

That means soon all our wishes
will once again be granted.

Right now, we're all wishing that
you'll beat that evil Bowser and
restore the peace.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
People who travel to here from
other towns must think that this

I'm used to it. I heard, though,
that somewhere in the world is a
hot town covered in sand. Now
THAT would be intolerable.

I don't believe it even exists.

Herringway?
Why, he's a mystery novelist who
lives in this city.

You suspect Herringway?

Nah! It couldn't be him!
He and the Mayor are friends!

He really does seem to be as
careless as they come, you know.

So, Mario, you're finally going
to fight against Bowser!

Trust me--we'll all be cheering
for you to beat him!

Once peace returns, I wanna go
visit Toad Town.
I wanna visit the great Mario's
house, too!

The last Star Spirit was held
near this city, wasn't it?

So, our humble frozen home is
the setting for a great story!

Oooh! How exciting!
I bet people in Toad Town will
start giving Shiver City some
respect now!

Herringway?
Yes, of course I know him.

Everyone in this city knows
about him. He's a world-famous
mystery novelist.

...You think Herringway killed
Mayor Penguin?
Hmm... That sounds nuts, but...

...you might be on to something.
Herringway does know everything
about crimes and criminals.

And he seems to have
mysteriously disappeared...

Herringway was writing a new
novel in his secret room.
No wonder nobody could figure
out where he was!

By the way, Mario...
You've read some of his
manuscript, haven't you?

Tell me the ending! Pleeeease!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mayor Penguin was murdered!

In his back room!
And no one has the slightest idea
who did it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! It can't be!
It's like we're in one of
Herringway's mystery novels!

How could such a terrible thing
happen in such a small, peaceful
city?

Who could do such a thing?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Mayor's wife said the man
with the mustache did it.

And he seemed to be such a
gentleman, too. Still, I guess you
shouldn't trust anyone who
carries such a huge Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brrr! How terrifying!
It just goes to show you that
you should never trust your
first impression of people.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Mayor wasn't murdered!

He just whacked his own head on
the floor and fainted.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But that means...
...the man with the mustache
wasn't evil, after all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, you're right!
Hey, I solved the case! The
criminal was a box of souvenirs
from Toad Town!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waaaa ha ha ha ha!
Who would've believed we'd have a
mystery in this sleepy city?

It's quiet, peaceful... I love it.
I'm going home now.
I'm gonna read a novel.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please come again, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look, I'm not selling anything to
Mayor Penguin's killer.
Get out of here, will you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Toad House slogan is... 
"Refresh your Body and Soul."

Do you want to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Huh?
You look OK to me, Mario.
Are you sure you feel like taking
a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hope to see you again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Sleep well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you have a good nap?

Good luck to you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
I took a nap, and when I woke up
there were all these items!

And it was the weirdest thing...
The floor was all wet, as if snow
had melted everywhere...

Do you think someone left these
as a present for you, Mario?
But who would do that???
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Starborn Valley and Shiver
Mountain are both near here.

But you'd better dress warmly if
you plan on reaching them.

You turned out...ahem...much
more normal than I expected.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Starborn Valley?

Oh. Sure.
Go east from this city.

But you have to be careful!

I have it on good faith that
there're lots of scary monsters
between here and there.

The thought makes me shiver...
It seems like all I hear these
days are frightening rumors.
What's Shiver City coming to?

I'm glad the case got solved.

You certainly got a raw deal for
a while there, Mario.

Aren't you afraid to take on

if you're really not the one who
murdered Mayor Penguin!

Until you do, I'm sorry, but I
can't let you leave the city. I
won't budge from this spot, oh no

I'm serious, now! There's no use
trying to move me!
...Am I being too rude? Sorry.

made, yah? Her exaggeration was

She reads too many of those

suspected you, too.

A friend of mine followed the

haven't seen him since. Do you
think he was captured?

So many people were caught...
I wonder if they're all OK.
Oh, I'm so worried.

This city is becoming pretty

I saw this totally suspicious
stranger wandering around just

He seemed to be searching for

off him!

Good luck! You'll need it!

Before you do, could you find out
who that stranger that I saw
before was?

I figure it must've been a
monster made of snow and ice. 

If that's true, this city is in
serious trouble!

What'll we do if it runs amok in
our streets?!
Mariooooo!!

Did you know that there's a Dojo

What?
You don't have anything?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey... You have...
...a First-Degree Card!

Heh heh heh. A beginner, huh?
I've got a Third-Degree Card.

Looks like I'm stronger than you.

Heh heh heh. It's a start.

Wow, you're strong!

Wooow! I mean, woooooow!
You beat The Master!!

There have been rumors of a

to keep the city's borders
extra safe.

It's scary out in the snow, so
city-skating we will go!♪

skating!!

skating all day long!

Cold... It's cold here!
It's too cooooold!
Brrrrr!

No ice-skating. Monsters about.
Nothing to do but shiver...
What did we come here for!?

It's not like we can just zip
back to Toad Town!

Hey, didn't you hear?

That monster's gone now!
Let's go to Star Valley and hit
the slopes!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That'll be great!
Skiing in a world of snow, ice,
and stars... 
How perfectly marvelous!

Sounds lovely!♥
Let's go! Let's go right now!

We're on alert because a
stranger appeared in the city.

So I can't let you pass without
permission from the Mayor.

Uh, hello? You're the number one
suspect in the Mayor's murder!

You can't leave the city! Not
until you prove you're innocent!

Oh, OK...
The Mayor said it's OK for you
to go on through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Basically, what I do is watch this
gate to see if strangers go in
or out of the city.

It may sound simple, but it's
incredibly important.
By and large, it's a good job.

It is a bit chilly, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The sky was filled with so many
beautiful stars last night.
It was really incredible.

I don't think it's quite as
beautiful as it was when things
were peaceful in the world, but
some of the brightness is back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What in the...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why are you in my fireplace?

You found my secret room...
...through the chimney...
...ingenious...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Me?
I'm Herringway. The novelist.

Haven't you heard of me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whaaat!?
Mayor Penguin was murdered?
And I'm the chief suspect?

You must be joking!
That's ridiculous!
I did no such thing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're very suspicious, huh?

Well, I suppose I would be, too.
It appears as though I should
drop in at the Mayor's house.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Engage stairs!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right then, come on. Let's go
to the Mayor's house.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's no time to lose. To the
Mayor's house!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's get to the bottom of this
case right now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's just like the Mayor,
hitting his head on the floor and
knocking himself out.

I was really worried there, and
all for nothing!

At least it wasn't a complete
waste of time. Now I have
material for a new novel.

You know... Maybe I could write a
story about you, too...

How about that? Ha ha!
Don't worry, I'd write about you
as a hero, not a criminal.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My secret room's exposed now.

The penguins of the city always
try to read my manuscripts
before I finish them.

I suppose I'd better make a new
secret room...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You saved the last Star Spirit!
Everybody's talking about it!

You know, I never thought about
you as the famous Mario.

It's so exciting to meet a hero!

I'm a huge fan!
I'm pulling for you!
Best of luck to you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey hey hey hey hey!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brrrraaah ha ha ha! Brrr!
I've been waiting for you,
Mariooooooooo!
I've been here forever!

I was getting desperate!
I thought I was gonna freeze!

This place is freezing, and cold,
and nasty and icy! I hate it!
I can't take it anymore!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I gotta get out of here!

I'm going to beat you up in
record time and head back to
some place warm.

You ready, ice-boy? Let's do
it!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, I've been busy, Mario! I
learned cooool techniques!

Check this out!
Aah hahhhhhhh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at that piece of work!
I've been taking a little magic
course on the side!

And now, you're gonna be my
final exam! Yeah!
I've gotta win this time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! You like magic tricks?
You won't like this one!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ha ha ha ha!! That felt
fantastic!

I just keep on getting better!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooooo!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boooooaaaaahhhh!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tuuuuurn back.
Coooome no farther.
Tuuuurn away, or I'll eat you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whaaaaat do you think?
Scaaaary monster, aren't I?
Youuu know you want to run...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Yeeeeees.
Veeeerrrry good.
Veeeeerrry smart.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whaaat!
Youuuu will regret this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you scaaaaared yet?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ho ho ho ho! Your puuuuny
attack doesn't hurt me at all!

Giiiiive up or suffer!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thiiiis is your only chance!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooo!
Ruuuuun away!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah. You're Mario, yes?
Thank you for coming.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How do you do?
I'm called Merle.

I care for the Star Kids born
here in Starborn Valley.

There are many things I must
tell you...

...but not here. Come, let's go to
my house.

I cannot concentrate out here in
the cold.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This way. Please follow me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I must apologize for the rude
reception of the Star Kids.

None of us expected that you'd
come here so quickly.

They frighten strangers to try
to keep this valley safe from
Bowser's followers.

Please...you must forgive them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Come in, please.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now. Mario.
You must heed well what I'm
about to tell you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This frozen area is called
Starborn Valley.

It is named this because it is
here that Stars are born and
raised before rising to the sky.

But now... Ever since Bowser
stole the Star Rod from Star
Haven...

The power of that place has
weakened and Star Kids have
found themselves unable to rise
up into the sky.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I sent a Ninji to my father,
Merlon, hoping that I could coax
you to come here...

Because I have found out where
the last Star Spirit is.

It came to me in a dream... A
vision of the last Star Spirit
begging me for help.

If my vision speaks truly, then
the last Star Spirit is being held
atop Shiver Mountain, which lies
to the north.

Up top sits the Crystal Palace.
The Star Spirit waits there.

The Crystal Palace was originally
built to honor the Stars...

But as time passed, it slowly 
faded from the memories of local
people...

...and now, no one can remember
how to reach the palace.

There is a way, though, and it
involves items that have been
passed down in these lands.

Here, take this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Scarf has been passed down
through many generations in
Starborn Valley.

I wish I knew how to use it...
but I do not.

According to the legends...
You must use this and another
item that has been passed down
in Shiver City

if you hope to open the way to
the Crystal Palace. Sadly,
that's all I know.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If things remain as they are,
Star Kids will never again be
able to rise to Star Haven.
Such a fate would be awful.

Please! Help them! And expel
Bowser from the sky!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh yes... Mario!
I'd almost forgotten!

There is supposed to be a small
shrine somewhere along the path
to the Crystal Palace.

A legend has been handed down
in this valley regarding the
shrine's secret:

"Truth lies not only in the eyes.
Sometimes, even walls may lie."

Confusing, yes, but you must
find this shrine and solve its
mystery to reach the Crystal
Palace.

Please don't forget it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mayor Penguin of Shiver City
should have the other vital item
you need. If you use it and the
Scarf,

it is said that the way to the
Crystal Palace will open.

First, you must go to Shiver City
and visit Mayor Penguin.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My dream told me that a Star
Spirit waits in Crystal Palace.
Please, you must save him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
You have saved the last
imprisoned Star Spirit!

I saw your triumph in a vision.

Now, finally, it is time to take
back the Star Rod.

Mario...
...the fate of the Stars rests
squarely on your shoulders.

Good luck to you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
I have a wish... My wish is for
you to reclaim the Star Rod as
quickly as possible.

The fate of the Stars and yes,
the whole world, lies with you.
Good luck to you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please get the Star Rod back
from Bowser, Mario!

The Mushroom Kingdom deserves
to be at peace.

Good luck...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can hardly believe it! You've
saved all the Star Spirits!

So I guess now you're going
straight to Bowser's Castle?

All right! I hope the princess
and everybody else is still doing
OK...

You'd better save them as
quickly as possible!
You're the only one who can do
it, you know.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Along with the Ninjis, we're
taking care of the Star Kids
under the instruction of the
mystic, Merle.

It's very rewarding to think
that one of these kids might
grow up to be a Star Spirit!

Oh, can you imagine it? What a
happy day that'd be...

But unless things get better
around here, it'll just be a
fantasy that never comes true.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Star Spirits are all back in
Star Haven! Hooray!

That means the day when these
little Star Kids might rise up is
coming soon.

Oh, I've dreamed about that day
for so long! Until it comes, I'll
keep taking care of them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
One of the Star Kids seems to
be playing hide-and-seek.
You haven't seen him, have you?

I swear, the second I take my
eyes off him he always runs off
somewhere...
What a naughty little Star Kid.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You saved the last Star Spirit!
Congratulations, Mario!!

Bowser doesn't have a chance!
You'll have that Star Rod back
in Star Haven in no time!

Best of luck!

Hey, by the way, I still haven't
found that Star Kid who's been
playing hide-and-seek... Where
could he be...?

Have you seen him, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're Frost T., correct?

The name's Parakarry. I deliver
letters.

I believe I have one for you.
Hang on a moment.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...no! Confound it!
I seem to have lost it!
...I'm terribly sorry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another letter, duly delivered.
A postman's job is never done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank you.

Ah! How nice!
It's a letter from little Dane T.
and Mini T.

Those naughty little rascals...
When I visited their home, they
were always up to something.

They do write me letters often.
It's nice to get letters... Their
mail makes me as happy as mail
from my wife and daughter.

Oh yes, I almost forgot! I need
a letter delivered.

I'd like you to take this letter
to Goompapa in Goomba Village.

It's actually a reply to little
Goombaria, but I think her dad
could explain it to her better.

Drop it off whenever you have a
chance, all right? Thank you so
much.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've got my hands full with these
Star Kids.

They're all so active!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why, they say you saved all of
the Star Spirits!
That's awfully good of you!

Now what you need to do is get
back that Star Rod.
Star Kids are counting on you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've never been so busy.
These Star Kids are as hyper as
the day is long.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I watch the sky at night...
The stars are so beautiful.

Soon, they'll be as bright as they
used to be, back when the Star
Rod was in Star Haven.

I just know it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
One of the Star Kids is hiding
somewhere! Hmmmph!
Could you tell me if you find him?

I suppose it's natural for
youngsters to be full of energy,
but they're trying my patience!
I don't have time for this...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Star Spirits are all back in
Star Haven? That's great!
I couldn't be happier!

Now, though, you still have to get
that Star Rod back.

These poor Star Kids...
Until the Star Rod's back, they
can't rise up to the sky.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wanna go to Star Haven.

When I get to go there, I wanna
deliver lots of people's wishes,
and I wanna become a great
Star Spirit someday.

When I do, I'll grant your wishes,
Mario! Of course I will!
I promise!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's Star Haven like?
You're gonna go there before we
even get to, aren't you?

I bet it's super cool...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder how Twink is doing?

He was the last one to rise up
to the sky. He went just before
Bowser took the Star Rod.

He was such a great kid. He
looked after everybody.

Do you think I'll ever get to see
Twink again?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! Yes! Stellar! I can rise up
to the sky pretty soon now,
right?

I can't wait! I'm gonna rise up
the second the Star Rod is back.

And the first thing I'm gonna do
is visit Twink.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You found me!
Hee hee hee hee...
What, did you see me glittering?

Hey, do you think I can rise into
the sky soon?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You found me!
Hee hee hee hee...
What, did you see me glittering?

When I grow up, I'm gonna be a
really great star that people
can see from really far away,
and I'll be really cool.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Tell me a story!
Tell me the story about the time
you saved a Star Spirit!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, when you see the Star
Spirits and they ask about us,

tell them that we'll be good so
they'll let us rise up as soon as
possible, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder what Twink is doing.

Do you think Twink's doing fun
stuff up there?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've still got some more time 'til
I rise up to the sky.

Once we all rise up, lots more
little stars will come here.

I'll be an older star then.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody read me a story.
It was all about how Stars
in Star Haven grant people's
wishes.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When I go up to the sky,
I wanna grant all the wishes of
everyone in this valley.

They take good care of us and
always stand up for us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm cooking for the Star Kids.
They're behaving pretty well.

That's a relief. It's probably
because they believe you'll get
the Star Rod back.
I certainly hope you do.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All of the Star Spirits have
finally returned!
What a joyous day!

Things are really looking up!
We're all cheering for you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The slogan of Toad House is...
"Refresh your Body and Soul!"

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Huh?
But...you look healthy.
You want to stay over anyway?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Pleasant dreams!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

I wish you luck!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A warm scarf!♥
Thank you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A cool bucket hat!♥
Thank you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a kind man you are!
We thank you.

As a reward for your kindness,
we shall tell you our secret.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please pass through here...
With many thanks and blessings
from the snowmen!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmm??
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooo!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's wrong with my eyes?
You look just like me!

Impostor! Who are you really?
Tell me your name!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm Kooper... Yeah, that's it.
The question is, who are you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wha... Wha... Whaaat!?
That's impossible!
I'm the one and only Kooper!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're talking crazy-talk now.
You're making no sense!
I'm the genuine Kooper! Really!

C'mon, Mario! You know me.
This guy's a big liar.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm not lying!
Mario...you know I'm Kooper,
don't you?

Don't you recognize your buddy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shut your mouth, goody-goody!
I'm his buddy! Yeah, that's it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why you... You're the one who
should shut his mouth! 
I'm his buddy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen, Moron...er, Mario, 
you have to decide who's lying.

It's the only way. Pick the one
you think is lying and whack him
really hard with the Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Fine! Yeah, fine with me!
If you think you'll get away with
a trick like that, fine!

I know Mario knows who I am.
I believe in you, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't listen to this idiot!
Look at him! He's a liar!
Go on, hit him! Hit HIM!

This guy thinks he can pull the
wool over your eyes, Mario!

Don't let him get away with it!
Hit him as hard as you can!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm not worried...

You and I go way back, Mario. I
know you know who I am.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow! Unbelievable!
You don't even recognize me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Baaa ha ha ha ha!
You simpleton, Mario!
I completely fooled you! Ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You deceitful monster!
How dare you try to trick Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What're you gonna do about it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeeeow!
What made you think that I was
the one lying, huh?

It must've been luck. No one has
instincts that good.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't be such a crybaby!
You lost!

What were you thinking, trying to
trick Mario like that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What? Shut up!
I'll trick YOU...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
At last...it is Mario!
I'm glad you found this place.

I've been expecting you.

Hm hm hm ho ho...
Do you find it strange that I
know of you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My name is Madam Merlar.
I am a messenger of the Stars.

You know Merlon and Merle well. I
am their ancestor.

The Stars spoke to me of you
through my dreams...

They said you would come to the
shrine on Shiver Mountain.
It is here that I guard the way
to the Crystal Palace.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We have little time to waste, so
listen carefully.

You may not know this, but the
followers of Bowser have invaded
Crystal Palace, where stars are
honored.

Now, what I have to tell you is
very important.
Listen to every word I say!

I can't tell you the whole tale.
In the interest of time I'll be
brief, so pay attention to the
key points.

The story begins a long, long
time ago...

I was still a young woman back
then...

A horrible thing happened on the
mountain one day...

I ran there immediately and...
...but it was actually...
.... 

Oh! Such a sight! I...
...was...and...it was so...
....

It was.....none other...... 
........so.......than....
.............then I....
.....................

...........   ......
.........
... .....
................
............   ......
........

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

..................................
..................................
..................................

.................so that's why you
must get Bowser's men out of
the Crystal Palace. But... 

Hey! You! Were you even
listening to my story?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well... OK, then.

As I was saying, you need the
Star Stone to reach the palace.

I'll give it to you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
With this stone, you can open the
way to the Crystal Palace. 
Go on. Make haste!

... Hmmm.
Do you think you understood my
shortened version of the tale?

It really doesn't do the story
justice, you know. Perhaps one 
day I'll tell you the full story.

Until then, good luck.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yikes! Mario's here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! We'd better beat him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noo!!
The real Mario's so strong!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What? Who are all of you!?
You're all trying to look like me!

Mario...
Don't tell me you can't tell which
one is the real Bombette! You
can tell, right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, I heard that!☆
You're spreading lies, you
impostor!☆

I'm the real Bombette!☆
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, no, no!♥

Mario. Look carefully at me and
you'll know.♥

I'm the real Bombette.♥ It can
only be me.♥
These others are all liars.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm the one!!!!
Mario!!!! Me!!!! Don't fall for
these tricks!!!!

I'll blow you up if you do!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I... I'm the real Bombette...
Puh... Please... Trust your eyes
and look at me...
I... I'm not lying...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooo!
I can't bear this!

Mario! Smash the impostors with
your Hammer!

All of you pretending to be me! I
can't take it another second!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, that's a nice idea.♥
That'll clear all this up.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, good idea!!!!
I just hate impostors!!!!

Mario!!!! I'm the real Bombette
so don't you dare hit me!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, I'm Bombette!
I'm not ever going to forgive you
if you mess this up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm Bombette!☆
You know it!☆
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario.♥
I am Bombette.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's no way that Mario will
make a mistake!!!!
We have journeyed so very far
together!!!!

Isn't that right, Mario????
You know which one of us is the
real Bombette, don't you????
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thuh... This is terrible...
It... It's so clear that I'm the
real Bombette...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Mario! You're terrible!
You don't even recognize me!
Oh, I can't bear it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ohh!☆
Somehow you managed to see
through my disguise.☆

Darn it!
I thought I was doing so well!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh!♥
You must be very smart to
figure out I was an impostor.♥

Curses! I thought we were doing
a great job of confusing you!
I'll be back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!!!!
Why did you hit me!!!!

Blast!
You found me!!
What's wrong with my disguise?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No... Noooo...
I... I should have worked harder
on my Bombette disguise...

I... I won't forget this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So! Choose the impostor!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you'd hit me with the Hammer,
Mario, I was going to bomb you
the next time you napped.

But you didn't!
I'm so happy that you knew I
was the real Bombette!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who're you?

The great and honorable Crystal
King said that I can't let anyone
pass!

You're up to no good! I'm going
to have to hurt you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I won't let you!
I won't and I won't and I won't!
You can't!

You'll have to go through me if
you wanna get past!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, didn't you hear me? I said
I'm not budging, you got that?

Do you have any idea how mad
the Crystal King will get if I let
you pass here?

I don't want him mad at me, so I
have to teach you a lesson!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
I'm the real Kooper.
But of course you know that,
don't you, old boy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
Look at me! I'm the real deal!
Nobody else looks like Kooper.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, come on!
I'm Kooper!
I mean, this is ridiculous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm the real Kooper, sonny.
You believe me, don't you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm the real Kooper.
There isn't any doubt in your
mind, is there? Brother?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, old bean...
You'd best smash these
impostors one by one.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a good idea.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brother,
smash them all except me, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen, old chap,
I'm the real Kooper.
It's rather obvious to anyone
with a bit of sense.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, listen.
I'm the real Kooper.
These others are impostors.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, open your eyes!
I'm Kooper!
I mean, seriously! Look at me!

Is it really that tough to see
through these "disguises"?
Please!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm the real Kooper, youngster.
You're not saying you suspect
this old Koopa, are you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brother!
I'm the real Kooper!
As my brother, you must be able
to see that, right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hm! Mario!
Well done! I don't know how you
did it, but you found me out!

Good-bye!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch! That hurt!
Still, good job.
You must have some incredibly
keen eyes to spot me.

Darn it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Ow!
You did that on purpose, didn't
you!?

That's just plain mean!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You must have some sort of sixth
sense, sonny.

Grrrr!
Remember me! I'll return!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brother!
I said I was the real Kooper so
many times... So mean...

Just joking.
I definitely thought I had you
going there, though...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You must choose the impostors!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! Yes!
Good call, Mario!

I knew you'd get it right!
Those were the worst disguises
ever!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can't go through here unless
you solve the puzzle.
Once you solve the puzzle, we'll
let you through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can't go through here unless
you solve the puzzle.
Once you solve the puzzle, we'll

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can't go through here unless
you solve the puzzle.
Once you solve the puzzle, we'll
let you through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Who comes to my palace!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
You finally arrived!

Heh, heh, heh, heh...
I know you believe you can save
the Star Spirit, but I'm afraid I
won't let you.

First I shall defeat you, then
I shall present Bowser with an
iced Mario gift!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no!
The last Star Spirit!!
King Bowser, forgive meeeeee!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My name is Kalmar.
Mario,
well done. Thank you for coming.

You have successfully rescued
all of us Star Spirits.
We are in your debt.

Now all that is left is for you
to challenge Bowser.

My Power should help you...

to bring back the Star Rod,
to beat Bowser, to bring peace
back to the Mushroom Kingdom,

and...
to save Princess Peach.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
you must make your way back to
Shooting Star Summit.

From Shooting Star Summit, we'll
prepare the route to
Star Haven.

The name of this route is 
Star Way.

Once you travel the Star Way,
you'll finally reach Star Haven.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My only wish is for you to save
this precious world.

You can do it, Mario.
Good-bye for now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bloooaaahhhhhhhh!!!!
Welcome, worm!

I'm called the Guard Door of
Bowser's Castle.
It's my job to keep suspicious
types from entering.

You must be Mario.
Let me guess... Do you want to
go through here? Hmm?

You want to get to the other
side of this wall, right?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's the matter with you?
You want to go through here,
don't you?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well, if you don't want to go
through here, then you're
wasting my time.
Go away! Now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK then... Heh heh heh...
Stand in front of me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's the matter with you? Are
you scared or something?
Quick! Come stand in front of me
if you want to pass through.

I don't have all day to wait for
you to wander over here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you standing squarely in
front of me?

OK... Then...I'll let you go
through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Are you standing squarely in
front of me?

OK... Then...I'll let you go
through.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gaaaah ha ha ha ha!!
You fell for it, worm!

You'll never escape from that
impenetrable prison!
Try all you like! All you'll do is
exhaust yourself!

I'll tell you what: If you make it
back up here, I'll let you go
through. How's that?

Ahhh ha ha ha! I know you'll
never make it!

I hope you have a good time
shaking and crying down there!
Gah ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Blooooaa-huh?!
You came back!?
You escaped from that
underground jail!?

But there was no way you could
escape!

Grrrrrrrrrrr..........
Of all the dirty tricks...

I guess I have to keep my word.
You can...go through. Grr.
But don't think I'll forget this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you've come to save us!

I just knew you would!

All the Toads in here used to
work in Peach's Castle.

The princess isn't with us... I
think she must be confined
somewhere else.

Mario, don't worry about us!
Saving Princess Peach is the only
thing that matters.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!
You've gotta save the princess!
You've just gotta!

She must be waiting for you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I still can't believe that all of
Peach's Castle was kidnapped
during the party.

I know it was just a means to
catch Princess Peach, but still...
Only an evil fiend like Bowser
would do something like that.

Please make him pay!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
I'm sorry that I can't be of help
to you...

But I'll make a wish to the Star
Spirits for your safety.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This wouldn't have happened if
we'd had better defenses. 

I don't know how I can ever
apologize to Princess Peach...

Ugh... It doesn't matter. Saving
her is all that counts now.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'd love to join you,
but I'd just slow you down...

Mario, please take care.

Don't worry about us.
We'll keep our eyes open for
Bowser's minions and find a way
out of this place.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!
You came at long last!

As you can see, we're in a 
horrible situation!

Princess Peach is who knows
where and her beautiful castle
is being run by Bowser's horrid
staff of rejects.

Nothing fills me with more joy
than serving this castle with my
heart and soul, but right now
there's nothing I can do.

We have no choice but to rely on
you now, Mario.

Please, at least save our dear
Princess Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...

Please save Princess Peach!
We're all relying on you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There we go!
It's a piece of cake to break
these walls. The material's weak.

These are much easier than the
walls of Koopa Bros. Fortress.

You're really lucky you have me
along, aren't you!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh-oh!
Ma... Mario...is right...there!

Now what were we supposed to
do in this situation?
Kammy Koopa told us something,
but I'm drawing a total blank.

I think...she told us not to let
him touch that switch...

Oh...oh...no... Do you think that
means we have to fight him?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No!!!!!!
He'll wipe the floor with us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stop your bellyaching!!
Who says we should be afraid of
Mario, huh? He's not so bad!

Whatever happens, we can't let
him push this switch!

Don't you care that King Bowser
needs our help?

C'mon!! Take this...plumber!!
Show him what you're made of!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Waahh!! We have no choice!
Gotta be brave... Gotta be...

Attaaack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, what do you know? It looks
like the lava cooled off.

It looks like it hardened enough
to walk on, too.

Awesome! You rule, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! That lava hardened when
it cooled off!
Now we can walk across it.

Let's go, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ohh... How totally weird!
The lava cooled off and became
hard as rock! Neat!

It seems cool enough for us to
walk on, Mario!
We can go on now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The lava seems to have cooled
and hardened...

Maybe we can walk across it...

Oh, excellent.
Even I couldn't fly across here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew... Finally, that hot lava
cooled off.

Now you can walk on it, Mario!

All the difficult obstacles in this
castle are really starting to
irritate me, you know.

Whatever. Let's get a move on.
Time for some lava-walking!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The lava, um, got all hard.
We can walk on it now, huh? Can't
we?

That tricky old Bowser!
He can't fool us, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What!? What is it!?
The lava cooled down and turned
hard enough to walk on?

Oh, how convenient.

I didn't really fancy the idea of
becoming a fried fish...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Awww...rad! The lava totally
cooled off and hardened!
We can walk across it now, right,
man?

Yeah. Way to use the old brain!
That's why you're The Man!

Every day, man, I learn
something new from you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!♥
You came to rescue me! Thank
you so much!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, me?
Oh, I just saw a chance to get
away from Bowser and I ran!

There's no need to fight him
because I'm already safe.

See? No need to fight.♥
Let's hurry up and go home.
I'll be right behind you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's go home now, OK?

We'd better go back the way you
came in.
I'll follow you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's go home now, OK?

We'd better go back the way you
came in.
I'll follow you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... What?
What's wrong, Mario?

...A suspicious guy?
I... I didn't see anything.
Maybe it was your imagination...

Huh...? You what?
You want to save the people in
Peach's Castle?

Who cares about them!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now there's no time to spare!
Let's get out of here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, ow! Please don't!
How could you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ouch! Oh, how could you?
You're so cruel, Mario!
Why do you want to hurt me?

I'm going to tell King Bowser
you're treating me like this!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No!! Ow! Stop it!
Please don't!!!
Help me, King Bowser!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I said, cut it out!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, shoot!
I wonder how you saw through my
disguise... It was perfect...

Well, I guess there's nothing I
can do about it now...
I'll just beat you up instead!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grooaaahhhhh!!!
Who would've thought you could
make it this far?

You won't make it any farther.
Because, unfortunately for you,
I won't let you pass.

Graaa ha ha ha ha ha!!!

But......
I guess, if you really want, I'll
give you one chance.

Because I know there's no way
you'll make it anyway.
Want to give it a shot?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh? Why're you still here?
Did you change your mind? Have
you decided to stop being a baby
and challenge me?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I see... Not up to it...
That's a smart choice,

because you and I both know you
wouldn't be up to my challenge.
You just be a good little boy and
run along, now...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Grrooaaa ha ha ha ha ha!!
This is completely pointless, but
I suppose I'll let you try,

because, of course, I have such
a kind and generous heart...
Just joking, worm!
Grooahh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!

Now! Mario!
Do you want to know what I've
got in store for you?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Now for a little quiz.

Several of my followers will come
out here. Your job is to
carefully keep track of their
numbers and colors.

Then you'll have to answer my
questions correctly.

Quite frankly, we both know that
this is impossible, but if you get
five questions right, I'll let you
go through here.

You're allowed only two mistakes,
though. Grooooaaaahh ha ha!

Fool that you are, you'll likely
make three mistakes and suffer
the dire consequences...

Let's get going!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK, smart guy, let's get going!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Time's up!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now.
Tell me, how many Koopas were
there!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now.
Which were there three of!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now.
Who came out of the middle
entrance!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now.
How many Goombas were there!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now.
How many arms did you see just
now!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now.
Which were there three of!?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now.
You just saw some Koopas. I ask
you this: What color were their
shells?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrr......
You're right!

That question must've been way
too easy.
Now they'll be harder!

Next question!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrrr......
Right answer!

Aaaarghhhhhhh!!!!!!!
I can't believe you've gotten
four questions right!

All right, enough of this! I'm
gonna quit messing around and
ask you a really hard one!

Next question!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Groooaaa ha ha ha ha!!
Bzzzz! Wrong!
What an idiot! Durrrr!

You'll be hating life if you make
three mistakes, Mario!

Gaah ha ha ha ha...
Let's get to the next question,
shall we?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrraaaaaaaaghhhhhhh!!!!
Cor.... Correct!!!

I can't believe it!
You got five of my super duper
brain-busters right!

Greaaaghhh!!!!!


I've been defeated...!!
By Mario!!!! Oh, the shame...!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bzzzzz! Pinhead!
Wrong again, worm!!

Something horrible will happen if
you make one more mistake!
Just one more, Mario! You're
hanging by a thread!


Gaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!


Now, the next question!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!
Nope, that's wrong, idiot!

You made three mistakes!
Too bad for you, Mario!

As promised, here's your horrible
reward!

Prepare for battle!
Anti Guys Unit! Attack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll let you go through if you
manage to beat them.
But that's impossible.

I guess you might as well try...
Groaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, but...no! NO!!
You beat the Anti Guys Unit?!!

My last line of defense!
The mighty Anti Guys didn't
stand up...to Mario!

Groahhhhhhh!!!!


I concede defeat.
I've been defeated by Mario!!!
Why? Why? Whyyyyy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pssst... Psssst...

The Toad House's slogan is... 
"Refresh your Body and Soul!" 
...This isn't a real Toad House,

but you can take a quick nap
here if you feel like it.
Are you going to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Really?
Mario, you're at full strength.
Are you still going to nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come back if you get
tired again...
Take care--if you can. And good
luck!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

These are difficult times...
Please rest well, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Then take care--and go!

Oops... Shhh...
I should be quiet... Otherwise,
they'll find us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, you're safe!
Oh, I'm so glad.

We all got captured before we
knew what was happening.

A few people at the party were
able to get away, but they
caught most of us. 

I wonder where Princess Peach,
the Minister, and all the other
guests are.
I'm really worried about them...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, your main goal is to save
the princess, isn't it?

She must be doing OK, holding on
to the belief that you'll come.

We soldiers should have broken
out to save her by now...

But it's taken all our efforts
just to protect the prisoners.
...What a shame.

I come all the way from Dry Dry
Desert to Princess Peach's
party and look what happens.

I've been to some lame parties,
but that was ridiculous.
I wanna go back to the desert
as soon as possible.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whuhhh?
Who're you, man!?

I don't know your face.
Maybe you're Mario, huh?
Heh heh... Just joking.

I'm the guard of this warehouse.
I'm really, really bored, man.

Hey, you know... If you've got
any coins, I'll sell you stuff.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

What? You've got nothing?
Lame...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, you're loaded, man!

Take a look around. I'll sell
anything you see.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You think I'm stupid, man?
You're a terrible liar.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleeeaaaargh!!
How in the world did you get this
far in the castle?
Congratulations...

...but this is the end of your
adventure, I'm afraid.
I've got much better defenses
than the other Guard Doors do.

Your luck has just run out!

Come on, boys!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here come the Koopa Bros.!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I bet you never thought you'd
see us again, huh, Mario?
You do remember who we are,
don't you?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Yeah, that's right!
We were too cool to forget! A
lasting impression, yeah!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

What!!!???

I just said we were the Koopa
Bros., Mario!
How can you not remember us?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now they're going to beat you
within an inch of your life!
Feel like running away, worm?

Tell you what: If you beat them,
you can go through here.
Of course, you'll fail...

but at least you can try.
Geeaarrr har har har....
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't think we're like before!

We've increased our power
beyond our wildest dreams!

After you trounced us, we
learned a new technique and
trained all day, every day.

We're not just the Koopa Bros....

We're the Super Ultra Mighty
Koopa Bros. the Great!!

Check out our coolness!

Huh...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uaaaaaaghhhh!!!

I found you, Mario!!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dwahhhhhhhhh!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
At last! You're mine! It was a
pain finding you, you know?

Today, at long last, I'll settle
my score with you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here it comes, Mario!!
This is the final fight!!!
Only one of us is walking away
from this battle!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Darn it!!!!!
OK, try this on for size!!

Ultimate Power!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shoooot!!!!!!!!!!!
OK, maybe something else...


How about this!!!???
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aaaargh!!!
You've still got some skills!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Darn it!! Darn it, darn it!
Don't think you've won, Mario!

I swear to you, I'm gonna beat
you so bad next time!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gosh!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ummmmmmmmmm........

So, since you beat the guy that
beat the Koopa Bros., does that
mean you beat the Koopa Bros.?

No. You beat him, he beat them...
But you didn't actually lay a
finger on........ 

Arrgaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
It's too confusing!!

.....OK, fine!

I guess there was no big
difference between that guy and
the Koopa Bros.
You can go through.

It's not possible for you to beat
King Bowser anyway.

I'll let you have the honor of 
being beaten personally by the
evil King Bowser. Lucky you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a makeshift Toad House.
The Toad House's slogan is...
"Refresh your Body and Soul!"

I know it's not a great house...
but plenty of sleep will heal you,
no matter where you happen to
be sleeping.

Will you take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Really?
You look fine to me, Mario.
Are you sure you want to nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please come again, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please, get some sleep.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Then take care--and go!

Good luck, Mario! Bowser will be
no match for you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario, thank you for coming.
It's so good to see you.

All the prisoners got split up so
it's just been us four...

Are the others all safe?
Please don't say we're the only
ones you've saved....

I hope this whole horrible mess
will be over soon so we can have
a reunion with everybody!

Thanks for coming.

I can't believe I was captured
so easily... How shameful.

I bet Princess Peach is being
held under heavy security.
Please! Save her.

If I'd known this was going to
happen, I would have gone home
with Mayor Penguin!

I wish I'd wake up in Shiver City
and never have to leave again.

Sniffle... Sob...
I dream of sweet shaved ice
treats every single day.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaa ha ha ha ha!!

If it isn't my old pal, Mario! I've
been waiting for you...
I'm amazed that you managed to
come this far.

How lucky...for me.

You've been a distraction for
far too long, little man!

It'll be a pleasure to squash you
personally! Again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Fool! You can't beat me! I'm
inviiiiincible!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaaaah ha ha ha!!!
All right, Mario!

Let's see your so-called power!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All right, enough of that!
Now witness the power of this
fully operational Star Rod!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What the...OW!
What in the world was that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Goooah?
What happened to the power of
that stupid Star Rod?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Graaaargh!
You cheap little...coward!!

This fight's just beginning!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gosh, you're not bad!
How'd you get so strong?

Still, you're just an annoyance.
That was like a warm-up for me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No!!!!! Leave me alone!!!
Mario, help me!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you want to save Princess
Peach, you'd better follow me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What took you so long, slowpoke?
I don't have all day, you know!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaaa ha ha ha ha!!
Welcome to your nightmare!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You should thank me, Mario.

Since you've been my rival for so
long, I've arranged a special
arena for your defeat!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaa ha ha!!! Like it?
You're completely trapped! How
does it feel, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, be careful!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleah nyeah heh hee ha heh!!
You fell right into our trap! And
you call yourself a hero?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you think we were foolish
enough to just sit back and
watch as you saved the Star
Spirits?

I've put together a little
surprise for you...a device that
increases Bowser's power!

King Bowser will be so powerful
that not even the power of the
Star Spirits can compare!

He'll now truly be invincible...
...thanks to my wisdom!

Are you ready, my King?
Then power up!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uuuuaaaaahhhhh!!!!!! Yes!!!
Oh, Kammy Koopa!
That was incredible! I feel like
I'm exploding with power!

Now I'll be able to squash this
cheeky plumber!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you! Mario! 
It's not going to be like before,
you mustached loser!
Prepare to be beaten!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwuuh huh huh huh!
Time to increase my power with
my good old Star Rod!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaaah ha ha ha!! You idiot!!
That weak attack doesn't
affect me anymore!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, we're hurting, Mario!
The Star Beam doesn't work!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no, Mario!
The Star Beam isn't working!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's the matter?
Why won't the Star Beam work?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh-oh, this is a problem!
The Star Beam's ineffective!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, don't just stand there
staring at the sky, Mario!
The Star Beam doesn't work!
Think of something!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no!! We're in trouble!
The Star Beam doesn't work?
Oh, that bad monster is gonna
beat us up now for sure...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, this is no good!
The Star Beam doesn't work!
What'll we do, Mario!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh man, just what we need!!
The Star Beam's broken!
What're we gonna do, man?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no! Brave Mario!

What can I do...?
The way things are going, Bowser
will surely defeat him...

Somebody... Please... 
Help Mario...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why do you have to constantly
run your mouth?
Keep quiet!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Princess Peach, are you all
right?
I'll get you out of those ropes!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twink!!
I'm so glad you're OK!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You insolent little Star Kid!
How dare you!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You little whippersnapper...
You're too young to fight me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I... I... I'm not afraid of you!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, be careful, Twink!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Twink......
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyeah heh hoo hah...
Did I just feel a breeze?
Was that really your attack?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ow! Why, you little...
So you can fight a little...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeeow! What's going on!?
Why does it seem like this Star
Kid's getting stronger!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It... It can't be....
My attacks don't work...

Oh... Oh no!!!

Now I remember... The Stars get
all of their power from ordinary
people's wishes... 

Peach's wishes are giving that
little Star Kid power!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooooohhh... King Bowser...
I have failed you...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yes! We did it, Twink!
Now we must save Mario!

But...
What can I do...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I know! Princess Peach!
Make a wish!

Just like you did for me! Make a
wish to give more power to the
Star Spirits!

Think of the Mushroom Kingdom, 
Star Haven, Mario...
Make a wish to the Stars,
thinking of all those things!

If your wish is strong enough, it
will reach the Star Spirits and
give them strength!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, Twink...
I'll try!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll go help Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaah ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!
What's the matter, Mario!?
Feeling a bit under the weather?

You ought to work out more!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh my!!!
I feel power flooding into me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Honorable Star Spirits,
I'll do what I can to help!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twink!?

What a surprise!!
I feel... The wishes of Princess
Peach and all of the Mushroom
Kingdom are giving us power!

Perhaps now we can match
Bowser's strength!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now! Mario!
Don't give up!

Everyone's behind you!
Receive our power and do your
very best!

Power up the Star Beam!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wha... What's going on...?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario! Are you still standing?
You should just give up!
You'll never beat me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaaa-huh!???
You've gotta be kidding me! My
Star Rod power's gone!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This battle's not over yet!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ohhhhhhh, NOOO!!!!

Mario defeated me...again... He
always defeats me...
This time I became invincible!
And I STILL couldn't beat him!

Darn it!!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You took back the Star Rod!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
I knew you would save me.

Thank you, Mario!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whuh? Huh? I'm awake! Huh?
What's going on!?
This isn't part of my plan!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yo! Kammy Koopa!
What's with all the shaking?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh, your Kingship, the battle
with Mario was so intense

that my device for increasing
your power seems to have
started malfunctioning.

Uh...it's entirely screwed up,
and its power appears to be
heading back into your castle.

I hate to tell you this, but
both your castle and this spot
right here are about to explode.

We must flee, my evil King! We
have no choice!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What...? Are you... Really?
That's...a big problem.
Let's get outta here right...

Huh?...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aaahhh!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mighty King Bowser...
I've been looking for you.

A report, Your Evilness:
Mario defeated the Goomba King.

He's heading for Toad Town now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What? Unbelievable!
What was Goomba King thinking?

I used the Star Rod to make him
a king because he begged me...

And Mario whips him so easily?
What a wimp!!

Uh...Kammy Koopa!
You ARE sure that Mario can
never defeat us, right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please, please, Your Vileness!
Try to be calm.
Goomba King is small-time.
I had a feeling he'd fail.

It doesn't matter, because
while you hold the Star Rod
you are definitely invincible.

You could beat Mario with one
claw tied behind your back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, yes. Very good!
Gwaaa ha ha ha ha!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By the way, Kammy Koopa,
those Star Spirits we captured
don't have any way of giving
Mario their power, do they?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please, don't worry yourself.
Each is held separately.

And each is carefully guarded by
your handpicked subjects.

Even Mario can't save all seven
of the Star Spirits.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm...

Who's the closest Star Spirit to
Mario? It's that one at
Koopa Bros. Fortress, right?

If Mario somehow reaches there,
can the Koopa Bros. defeat him?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
King Bowser, you mustn't worry...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hi-yaa!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here come the Koopa Bros.!!

Uh-huh! Oh yeah! We're the
coolest of cool!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...
Pssst! Kammy Koopa.
Are you sure these guys can get
the job done?

That Goomba King was gigantic,
and even he couldn't beat Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pssshaw! Get real, King Bowser!

Yeah, the Goomba King was huge,
but he was a total wimpola!
We're nothing like him!

See, what we've got going on is
the power of teamwork...

Together, we can put the hurt
on Mario in seconds flat!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Excellent!
That's the spirit! Sell it,
Koopa Bros.!!

Show our king that special
attack you do so well!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, ma'am!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ready, everybody!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh...OOOH!


That... This is... Ohhhhh!!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How'd you like it?
King Bowser? How was it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, yeah! Excellent!! Really!!
I'm not easily impressed, either!

Mario won't have a chance if you
finish him with that attack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We'll take him, King Bowser!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By the way, my Koopa Bros....

About the captured Star Spirit
I've locked up in your fortress...
Who's guarding him right now?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Uh...nobody, sir...
You know, we're here and so...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You idiots!! Use your heads!
Get back to the fortress and
guard that Star Spirit!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sniffle...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario's probably hurt...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everyone's in prison...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Mushroom Kingdom will be
destroyed if things continue the
way they're going.

Something must be done...

If only somebody could help me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaa ha ha ha ha!!
My dear Princess Peach,
how are you doing this fine day?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's no use waiting for Mario this
time, my dear!

We're soooooo high above the sky
right now.
Even Mario doesn't have a
chance of reaching us up here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, Princess, as long as I
have this Star Rod, no one in the
Mushroom Kingdom can touch me.

You know the power that grants
everyone's wishes? It's mine!
Isn't that just wonderful?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nyeah hee hee hee!

Imagine what it's like down in
your kingdom! Your subjects
must be so upset because their
wishes aren't being granted!

Oh, how delightful!
They deserve it for the way
they've treated us Koopas over
the years!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you, you know, want anything,
all you need to do is ask me,
Princess. I can grant wishes.

Of course, I'll only grant
requests that I like...
Anyway, think about it.

You take care, Princess Peach!
Enjoy your stay here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You watch yourself, Princess.
You'd better not cause trouble.

Bleah heh heh ho ha ha...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Please...
If only somebody could help me...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello, Princess Peach!
Pleased to meet you!

My name is Twink.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But you're...
You're a Star Kid, aren't you?
How'd you get here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I came from Star Haven to
grant your wish!

It's our job to grant wishes, you
know.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! You came because I wished
that somebody could help me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, of course!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, that's just great!
Thank you so much for coming!

Here's my wish: Go right now and
take that Star Rod back from
Bowser, OK?

Think you can do it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
......

Uh...sorry...
That's a little much for a novice
Star like me...

Maybe one of the honorable Star
Spirits from Star Haven could
grant a wish like that.

I'm so sorry.
Please, ask for something easy,
something a small Star can do.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Then... Can you take me away
from here?

Everyone in my castle has been
captured and I have to save
them all as soon as possible.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Oh...I'm sorry.
I can't grant that wish either,
I'm afraid.

Actually, I just got called up to
the sky a day ago, so I can't do
big wishes yet...

If I were a more splendid Star,
maybe I could actually help...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's all right...
Don't be sad, Twink.

Mario will definitely do something
to save us all.
He's probably coming right now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Twink!
Do you think you can find Mario?

I want you to give this to him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Lucky Star, isn't it?

OK! I'll do it! Princess Peach,
I'll fly to the Mushroom Kingdom
just as quick as I can!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Wait, Twink!
Wait one second! Can you also...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Please tell Mario that...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm fine and he shouldn't worry...
...OK? Can you tell him that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course!
I'll tell him your exact words,
Princess Peach! Definitely!

Now, don't despair...
I'll be back soon, so stay safe
until I return, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario... Where are you...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder what Mario is doing
right now...

I wonder if he's hurt...
I'm so worried about him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He'll be all right, Princess.

Why, I bet he's saving some Star
Spirits right now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes... You're right, Twink.

I must be strong.

I need to concentrate on finding
a way out of here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
But there are tons of guards
just beyond your door...

And it's impossible for you to
escape through the window...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Wait a minute!

I remember the Minister telling
me that there was a secret
passage out of this room!

Twink!
Help me look for it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Cool! Great idea!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The fireplace... Quite nice...
So big...and so warm...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm... A warm fireplace?
Don't you find that suspicious?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you really think so, Twink?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So many dresses...and yet they
all look exactly the same!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
They're not the same!
The designs are all slightly
different and very fashionable!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! A photo of Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't look at that!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is no time to sleep.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, let's keep looking!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Beautiful flowers, aren't they?
They smell so good...♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sure. I guess.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Eeew!
I look frightful!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's not real, Princess...

but... I must say...
That's not a good look for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Look!
There's something behind this
drawing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes!! Cool!!
Now we can get out of this room!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

  Ohhhh!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where are we... ?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Looks like it's locked.

Oh no...
We can't get out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Look at this!

It looks like somebody left a
private diary just lying around.
Should we read it?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Ohhh... You like doing this sort of
thing, do you? Tsk tsk!

OK, then...very quietly...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's see...

Day: ○/○  Month: ☆ 
Sunny

Today I went to Star Haven and
stole the Star Rod.
Now I'm invincible! Cool!

I also captured those seven
Star Spirits, so they won't
annoy me anymore.

It was a hard day's work and
I'm feeling pretty bushed.
Dinner was nice but a bit bland.

........

I feel like I might know the
person who wrote this...
Should we read more?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK, let's continue.

Day: ○/×  Month: ☆
Cloudy then sunny

Today was great, diary! I used
my castle to lift Princess
Peach's Castle way up into the
sky! 

Then I barged into Peach's
Castle and beat up Mario! Yeah!
Unbelievable, I know! So fun!

And there's more! After that, I
kidnapped Princess Peach!
I couldn't be happier, diary!
I hope she likes me...

...!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach! This is Bowser's
diary! Ugh!

What'll we do?
Should we read more?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

What? Really?
You're stopping now?

There might be a hint that can
help Mario in here!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Day: ×/×  Month: ☆
Sunny

Well, the Koopa Bros. got beaten
by Mario, diary.
He even set free that stupid
Star Spirit I kept there.

I'm so mad I can barely write!
"Ohh, I'm Mario, I'm so big and
strong and good and helpful..."

I hate him! But I'm not worried.

There's no way Mario can save
the Star Spirit being held
in Dry Dry Ruins.

To do that, he'd have to solve
the mystery of the sands and
then find Dry Dry Ruins in 
Dry Dry Desert.

How would he even know to go to
the desert, anyway?

So I'm not worried at all.
In fact, I'm so calm I'm gonna go
to bed now.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
!!!!!

Dry Dry Ruins in the middle of
Dry Dry Desert!
One of the revered Star Spirits
is being held there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twink, do you think you can
find Mario and tell him that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, of course, Princess Peach!
I'll find Mario right away...

???
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no! I can't believe I left my
secret diary lying out!

It would be so embarrassing if
somebody read that thing...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whuh... Wha... Whaaaat?
What's the princess doing here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
AAhhhh!! You little sneak!
You read my diary!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
King Bowser!
Is there a problem?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're the worst guards ever!
Take Princess Peach back to her
room! Immediately!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, sir! Straight away! Forgive
us, sir!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooooo! Put me dooown!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaa ha ha ha...hello.
How're you feeling, Princess?

Nothing makes me happier than a
smile from you, Peach.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, tough luck! I'm in a very
bad mood, you monster!

You've imprisoned all of the
guests from the castle!

You are the single greatest
disaster to ever befall the
Mushroom Kingdom!

I'll tell you what: I'll smile
when you make everything as it
was before you showed up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaa ha ha! Oh, that's rich!
You know I can't do that!

That jerk Mario just beat the
Koopa Bros. and Tutankoopa!

Sure, they were complete wimps,
but they were still loyal to me. I
can't forgive Mario for
disrespecting me!

I'm nipping this in the bud right
now. I'm going to use Invincible
Tubba Blubba on him.

He's the strongest creature I
know...after me.
You'd best forget about Mario...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Nastiness!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We have a problem!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why, Kammy Koopa!
What's got you so riled up? You
look upset.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Psst...Psst...Psst...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whaaaat!!?
The Star Spirit flew away from
Tubba Blubba's Castle...!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ki... King Bowser!
Keep your voice down!
Princess Peach will hear you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmm... Yes, right... 

Tell me the details over there.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twink, did you hear that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes! I sure did!
The Star Spirit must have
escaped...

Did you hear him call that Tubba
Blubba thing "invincible"?

That doesn't sound good!
Do you think Mario can win?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We'd better try to find out
about Tubba Blubba.

If we could find something,
ANYTHING, about a weak point...
it might just save Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Good idea!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Then... There's no time to lose.
We won't get anything done if we
stay in this room.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are still guards outside.
Be careful not to get caught.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are guards here, too. 
Probably lots of them. We'd
better be extra careful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Hey...  Have you heard
about Master Tubba Blubba?

I heard a rumor that he loves
eating ghosts!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh... Ghosts, huh?

Master Tubba Blubba... 
He lives deep inside of
Forever Forest, doesn't he?

I think he's guarding one of the
Star Spirits right now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, Master Tubba Blubba lives
in the castle at the top
of Gusty Gulch.

I heard that somewhere near his
castle is a mansion and a village
full of ghosts.

I guess Master Tubba Blubba 
sometimes goes there to catch
Boos.

And then, when he catches one,
he gobbles it down starting with
its head! Chomp!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brrrrr...
Oh, man, that's so scary...

Now I won't be able to walk to
the bathroom alone at night...
And I'm gonna have nightmares, I
know it! Why'd you tell me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I also heard that Master Tubba
Blubba is invincible.
They say he can't be hurt.
Nobody can even scratch him!

He might even be stronger than
King Bowser...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stronger than King Bowser?
Come on! That's impossible!

Even Master Tubba Blubba has to
have some weak points. It's just
common sense!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah... You may be right...

There's another rumor that
Tubba Blubba's got a secret
that would ruin him if it ever
got out.

I bet it's about his past. I
heard he didn't used to be
strong at all...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Shhhhhhhh!!!!!
 

What if Tubba Blubba hears you?
He might gobble us up!

...Still...
What do you think his secret
could be, anyway?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I don't know.
No one knows. That's why it's a
secret, you half-wit!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twink... 
It sounds like Tubba Blubba has
a weak point, after all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If only we could find out...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Huh?
Hey... Did you hear someone
talking just now?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gasp!

Do you think someone knows we're
goofing off in here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Whoa!
Princess Peach!!
How'd you get here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sorry to do this, but...
You have to go back to your
room. Right now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Nooo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder how Mario is doing...
Do you think he found a way to
beat that Tubba Blubba?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder, too.
I'm so worried...  What if Mario
got hurt...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well... Um... No use wondering!
Why don't we go out and try to
eavesdrop again?

If Mario managed to beat Tubba
Blubba by now,

Bowser and his followers will be
really, really mad!
...Don't you think?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You may be right, Twink!
There's no use just sitting
around worrying like this.
Let's see what we can find out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It can't be!! No! No! No!
Explain that again! Slowly!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Wretchedness,
I keep trying to tell you.

Tubba Blubba was...gulp...
defeated by Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, that's strange because...
YOU TOLD ME HE WAS INVINCIBLE!
How can you beat someone who's
invincible?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grrrr...  Stupid Mario...
I guess maybe he found out the
secret that made Tubba Blubba
not quite so invincible...

And then he beat him...
Gah!!! I despise Mario! Really!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Filthiness...
We have to come up with another
tactic, and quickly.

Mario will most likely go
to Shy Guy's Toy Box next.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes... So we should prepare
something there for his arrival.

I won't be satisfied just having
him beaten up anymore!

What we need to do is find his
weak point and completely
humiliate him! Yeah!

Kammy Koopa, you've gotta find
out what Mario hates, and...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Unh...?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Gaaaah!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

For the love of... Why...
Why is Princess Peach here?!
What's wrong with those guards?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No... Wait, hang on.
This is actually good timing,
my mischievous princess.

We're just discussing the weak
points of our mutual friend,
Mario.

So... Princess Peach...
What do you know about his
weaknesses, huh?

And listen. You must be honest!
Which one of these things does
Mario hate most?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Mmm...
I see! Excellent!

Is there another thing that fills
him with dread?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Good, good...
And how about these things?
Which of these does he hate?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, excellent!
Perfect! Thanks, Princess!

Gwaa ha ha ha ha!!!
Be sure Mario can't avoid these
things that he hates! We'll
beat him for sure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you get all that, Kammy
Koopa?
Get going immediately!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bleah heh nyeah heh ho!
Of course, Your Gnarliness!

Mario's really in for it now...
...or is he...?
Hmmm... I started to wonder for
a second there...

But, then again, King Bowser's
ordered this so I have no choice
but to obey him...
I guess we'll see!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm not sure we can entirely
trust what the princess tells us
about Mario's weak points, but
I'll do as you say.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course you will.
My tactics are brilliant. They're
pure art!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

So... Kammy Koopa,
have Princess Peach taken back
to her room immediately.

Finally, we will witness the end
of Mario! At last!
Gwaa ha ha ha ha ha!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Guards! Attention!
Take Princess Peach back to her
room at once!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, ma'am!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooo! Not again...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey... Twink.
Those guards have stopped
paying attention to us again.

Let's sneak out of here.
We might be able to find some
news to help Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you think it's still safe to
use that secret path?

Don't you think Bowser's figured
it out by now?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's still all right, Twink.
Bowser hasn't noticed anything.

He looks scary, but he's
basically a major bonehead.
Let's get out of here. C'mon!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Urp... Huh...?
Who are you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why, I'm Princess Peach.
And who might you be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! You're Princess Peach.
Everyone calls me the Gourmet
Guy for some reason.

I guess I'd better report you to
King Bowser. You aren't
supposed to leave your room.

But I AM really hungry... Tell
you what... I'll keep this a
secret if you make me something
really yummy.

So, Princess Peach,
what do you say? Will you cook
me something or what?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'd love to cook for you, Mr.
Gourmet Guy, but...
I have no ingredients and no
utensils.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Aw, that's no problem.
There's a kitchen one floor below
us. It's five-star!

You can go cook there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here, you'll need this.
This key will open the door that
leads downstairs.
Now you can get to the kitchen.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So! I'll just sit here and wait
for my yummy meal, OK?

Oh yeah, I forgot...
There are plenty of guards
downstairs, so be careful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... I can't wait...♥

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here you go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! I've been waiting so long!
I've wasted away to nothing!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thank you!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooooooo! Haaaaackpth!
Aw, disgusting! This is awful!

Where'd you learn to cook, Truck
Driving School?
Go back to the kitchen and follow
a recipe or something!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll never eat such a nasty
creation again, I tell you!
I swear...trying to poison me...

Go back down there and make
something good, will you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What ingredients did you use in
that monstrosity?

Whatever they were, I think they
were seriously wrong!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ack! Bleeaaagh...!
Awful! Just awful!

You didn't mix the ingredients
very well!

You have to mix them right!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Cough...gag... Pbbbbth!
This wasn't baked for the right
length of time!

Listen, baking is the most
important part of cake making!
You have to time it properly!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmmmm... No no no. All wrong.
Look at this decoration. Awful.

You shouldn't have too much or
too little decoration on a cake,
don't you know that?

Try to use a little more care
next time, OK?
I feel sorry for the cake.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...       Ohhh,
Ohhhhhhh!!!!!

Deliciooooooous!!!

This is way too DELICIOUS!!!!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew... 
That was really good.

I haven't felt this way since...
well, ever!
To show you my gratitude, I'll
tell you a secret.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
One of the Star Spirits is inside
Mt. Lavalava on Lavalava
Island.
This island is to the south.

You should tell this to Mario.

But you'd better tell him that
there's also a nasty Lava
Piranha guarding the Star
Spirit.

He'd better be careful.
I really don't dislike Mario.
That's why I'm telling you this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twink, did you hear that!?
Mt. Lavalava! Lavalava Island.
The Star Spirit is being held
inside that volcano!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario could really use this
information, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, he could...

Twink, I'm sorry that I keep
asking you to do this stuff,
but...can you go tell Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course I will.
I'll do it right now!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'll be back soon, Princess
Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What's with all the shouting?
Keep it quiet in here!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So! It was you, Princess Peach!
You've got to keep it down!

You're a prisoner, and as a
prisoner you need to keep...

...Whuh!?
What are you doing out of your
room, anyway!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Guards!!
Get the princess!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooooo!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Things are getting pretty weird
in the castle, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You said it...
But at least we can go
downstairs with this key.

Maybe we'll find something out
while we're down there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, here's the kitchen.

So...
What shall we do first?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach!
This looks like a good cookbook.
Let's use it, OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How's it look? Twink?
Anything look really yummy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hang on a second...

Oh! How about this?
"Special Strawberry Cake."
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Sounds good!♥
Let's whip one up!

OK, Twink,
read me the recipe.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're in the middle of the
recipe! Where are you going?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Ummmm...
You haven't made anything yet.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Ummm... It needs something...
You haven't decorated it yet.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach, you're leaving
without the cake!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, Princess Peach.
This time, we're gonna make a
delicious cake, right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We sure are! I know we can!
This is going to be the best cake
Gourmet Guy's ever eaten!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK, Twink,
if you please, read me that
recipe again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's start from where we left
off, OK?

We got as far as putting in the
Sugar and Eggs...

but we need to mix it better.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your bowl's over there. It has
Sugar and Eggs already in it.
Why don't you go over there?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's start from where we left
off, OK?

We got as far as mixing the
materials in the bowl...

but the Flour and Butter need
to be added properly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You already have a bowl with
some batter in it over there.

Now you need to add Flour and
Butter to the bowl.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's start from where we left
off, OK?

We got as far as adding Flour
and Butter...

but the actual baking part
needs some work.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your bowl full of batter is right
over there.

Mix it lightly and pour it into the
pan, OK, Princess?

After you've poured it into the
pan, bake it in the oven for 30
seconds.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's start from where we left
off, OK.

We got as far as baking the
cake in the oven...

We should've decorated it with
the Cream first and then the
Strawberries, I guess. Oh well.
Let's do it right this time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, that's one good looking
cake, huh?

All we have to do now is decorate
it and we're done.

What you want to do is put some
Cream on it first and then add
some Strawberries.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You want to start over from the
beginning, Princess?
Let's clean up first.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, Princess Peach,
this time we can do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We sure can! I know we can!
This is going to be the best cake
Gourmet Guy's ever eaten!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK, Twink,
if you please, read me that
recipe again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well...

OK. Please listen carefully.
First... 

put Sugar and Eggs in a bowl.

Go ahead, Princess Peach.

When you've finished, let me know
and we'll move on to the next
step.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Done?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please tell me when you're done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK. Let's move on to the next
step then.

Now...

Mix and whip the ingredients in
the bowl.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All set?

When I say "start," press {A} as
fast as you can for 10 seconds
to mix the batter.

Are you ready?

Start!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's it! Great job!
Did it go well, Princess Peach?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, no! In that case, what do
you want to do now?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK. Let's go on to the next step
then.

Now...

Put Flour and Butter in the bowl.

Go ahead, Princess Peach.

Just let me know when you're
done and we'll move on to the
next part of the recipe.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Done?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Just let me know as soon as
you're done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK. After you've mixed the
ingredients in the bowl, pour it
into the pan.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
On to the next step!

Now...

Bake the batter in the oven for
30 seconds.

OK. Head over to the oven.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can put the cake in the
oven with {A}.

Press {A} again when you think
30 seconds has passed, then
take the cake out of the oven.

You can't redo this part, so be
extra careful.

OK. Please put it in the oven.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Done?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Oh, no! In that case, what do
you want to do now?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

OK, put the cake on the table to
cool.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK. This is the last thing to do.
We're going to decorate it with
cream and strawberries.

Let me know when you're all
finished decorating.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Done?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Just let me know as soon as
you're done.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Yes!!
We made it! It looks great!

OK! Let's take this to Gourmet
Guy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pick up this {x}?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Put down this {x}?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You picked up the {x}.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You put down the {x}.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Put down this {x} and
pick up this {x}?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You put down the {x} and
picked up the {x}.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...

...Hey, Twink...
How would you feel about
sneaking out of here again?
Shall we try?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach!
You've gotten so bold!

And here I thought you were
gentle and delicate...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh.......
I... I am delicate!

I'm behaving like a delicate
princess, just like the Ministers
taught me to! 

I love to be delicate!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, OK...
...I believe you, Peach. You're
the princess...

Anyway, let's go for it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! It's Princess Peach!
How'd she get out?!

King Bowser's really gonna flip
his wig if we don't take her back
to her room!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now, hang on just a second. Get
a grip on yourself, OK? No need
to panic. She can't get out of
the castle, anyway.

And besides... What do you think
about asking Princess Peach to
participate in our little game?

She'd be ideal, and we need a
third person...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmmm... Yeeeeah. Yeah!
You might be on to something!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK! Let's do it!

Princess Peach, have you been
listening? Come this way.

We won't tell King Bowser about
your escape if you help us with
this little game we're playing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're set up right over here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh no... Princess Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

We'll see you at the next Trivia
Quiz-Off!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh... Princess Peach.
I almost forgot! Here's your
prize for participating.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Sneaky Parasol.
If you face someone and press
{B} you can transform into that
person.

You just have to promise not to
use it to sneak around.
I mean, nobody would know you
were Princess Peach! Imagine!

Sorry for giving you such a little
prize, Princess.

Heh heh heh... Hey, it's only a
prize for participating...so what
do you expect!?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
What are you all doing?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hey! It looks fun!
I'm gonna join in!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What?
You've already finished?
Aw, of all the rotten luck...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gaaaah!!
Princess Peach? What's she doing
here?

She sneaked out again! Grr!

You!! 
Take Princess Peach back to her
room! Now!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, sir!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sorry, Princess Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nooooo!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey... Twink.
You know the Sneaky Parasol I
got on that quiz show?

I can change into someone else
when I use it, right?

So don't you think I can use it
to get out of here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah... I bet you can...
Why don't you try it out?

Press {B} while facing whoever it
is you want to transform into. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey. How goes it?

Phew... They've been working me
like a dog lately... 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You too?
Seems like everybody's busy...

King Bowser's all ticked off
about something and Kammy
Koopa takes it out on us.

You think, maybe...? Maybe it
means that Mario's coming to
defeat King Bowser!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sayyyy...
I heard that Kammy Koopa is
building some big thing above
Princess Peach's Castle.

I bet you it's a secret weapon
designed to defeat Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That thing that Kammy Koopa's
making up above the castle... I
wonder what she could possibly
do with it?

It's not even possible for Mario
to get up here, so why would she
need a secret weapon?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
On patrol? Very good, then.
You can pass through.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What are you doing here?
Get back to your station!

Kammy Koopa will chew us both
out if she finds you here instead
of at your post!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh? Are you insane? Get back 
to your post! Do you have any
idea what Kammy Koopa will do to
you if she finds you here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why do we bother patrolling?
I mean, don't you agree? Sure, I
know, Princess Peach got out a
couple of times... 

But this castle is hovering in the
middle of the sky! Where's she
gonna go? Huh?

I think King Bowser's nervous. He
hides it well, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Listen, don't hang around me.
Kammy Koopa'll get really mad
if she finds you here.

I guess I understand why you're
so curious, though.
It's not often you get to see so
many books in one place.

I've gotta admit, sometimes I
sneak a few peeks myself... 
Heh heh heh...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wha... What're you looking at?
I... I'm not looking for the book
you think I'm looking for!

I swear! No fooling!

I'm trying to study...something!
Here, take this and go away! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Seriously, leave me alone.
I'm really trying to study.

I always get this killer headache
when I open a book...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! You!
Stop loitering around here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you still here!?
Get back to your post before I'm
forced to report you to Kammy
Koopa!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Why'd you leave your station?
Oh... You're looking for your
relief, huh? Well, get a move on,
then!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sighhh... So booooored...

I wish I were Princess Peach's
personal guard. Then I could
admire at her beauty all day
long.

I hope she breaks out of her
room and comes here today...
I can't believe I said that! You
didn't hear that, did you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey! Hold up!
Your shift? Oh, hurry up, then!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All quiet here!
... Me? Nervous? No, not me! You
surprised me, that's all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm not goofing off! I swear it!
Please, let me guard in peace!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where have you been?
You took your sweet time!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where's my relief, already?
My shift has been over for ages
now! 

Listen... Could you go find that
slacker and get him up here?
Please! I'm exhausted!

{Clubba}
 ← He looks like this.


He's probably goofing off
outside the castle somewhere.
Here. Take this to find him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the key to the entrance of
the castle.

You won't be able to get
downstairs without it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He still hasn't shown up...

{Clubba}
 ← Find this guy, OK?


———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! Finally! About time!
You're so late! Again!
Don't you know how to read the
shift schedule?

Well, I guess I'll let it go this
time, but watch it, OK?
OK. Have a good shift.
I'm shovin' off.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Don't goof off, either!
You're on thin ice, buddy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Zzzzz...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh...nnnn...
...Princess Peach...somewhere
around here...close by...

Zzz... mumble... mumble...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, it's you!
Oh no, it's just me. Hello me!
Zzz... mumble... mumble...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So sleepy... So very sleepy...
Just lemme catch a quick nap...
but don't tell anyone...
Zzz... mumble... mumble...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, you! Yeah, you!
Entry is prohibited for
unauthorized people.

But...you're already up here, so
I guess it's too late.

It's a stupid restriction,
anyway.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's about time Kammy Koopa
came back down.

I wonder what she could be doing
up there? All those construction
sounds...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
OK, OK. Everything's finally
ready.

Even if Mario shows up with all of
the Star Spirits, we'll still be
all right!

It pays to expect the worst.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Absolutely! Affirmative! You're
right, Kammy Koopa!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mmm!!
You there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're doing a fine job.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Keep up the good... Wait...
Something's weird about you...
You smell...too nice...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yahhhh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh-oh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You... Why you little...
Princess Peach!
Unbelievable! Out again!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Guards! All of you!
Catch this little runaway and
take her back to her room!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you all right, Princess?
You're not hurt, are you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you, Twink.
That was such a dumb mistake!
I've got to be more careful.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It'll be OK next time, Princess
Peach.

If you put that Sneaky Parasol
to good use, you can get out of
here without being spotted.

Press {B} while facing the person
you want to change into.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach, you need to be
more careful, OK?

That Sneaky Parasol is the key
to getting out of here without
being discovered. Just use it
properly.

Press {B} while facing the person
you want to change into.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like you can't get out
this door, Princess.
There has to be another way...

Hey! Princess Peach!
Do you remember that Sneaky
Parasol that you won?

If you put that Sneaky Parasol
to good use, you can get out of
here without being spotted. I'm
sure of it!

Press {B} while facing the person
you want to change into.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Mario... I wonder what he's
doing now?

I wish I knew if I was helping him
at all...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Of course you are!

Mario will be fine! You should be
proud of your efforts!

Mario knows all you've done.

And don't you worry, Princess!
You'll be able to talk to him in
person before long!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Tee hee hee... I hope you're
right, Twink.
Thanks for cheering me up.

Let's go back to the room, shall
we?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, Princess Peach! Your cuddly
old Bowser's here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Can't we have a friendly
conversation for a change?

C'mon! Lemme see a smile!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I have nothing to say to you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, don't be such a pill.

You're stuck with me for a long,
long time, beautiful.

You'd better get used to it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario is coming, Bowser. And you
can't stop him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gwaa ha ha ha!!


Oh, you poor, silly girl!

I'm invincible with this Star Rod,
didn't you know?
Mario's no match for me!

He's history. Get over it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
................

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Raunchiness! We have an
emergency!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Grr! It'd better be important!
I'm right in the middle of a
friendly chat with the princess.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh... Mario has now saved all of
the Star Spirits!

There...IS a chance he could
come here using their power...

We must make ourselves ready in
case he shows up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What! Gah!
Mar-i-ooooo!

OK. Listen, Kammy Koopa.
Send everyone to their posts! 

We'll ambush him the second he
enters my castle!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach, why don't you
come with me to watch...
You can have a front-row seat
to see Mario get crushed.

You! Yeah, you!
Tie her up immediately! If she
gets out this time, heads will
roll!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No! Please!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You big...Koopa! Show some
respect to the princess!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What is this whining little
glittering thing? Confetti?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Gah! Buzz off!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twiiiiink!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Take the princess! Now! Let's
move!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Noooo!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What?! Princess Peach!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know you're not allowed to
leave the room!

I'm sorry, but I have to take
you back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are you all right, Princess? Did
they hurt you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you, Twink.
That was just plain stupid! I've
got to be more careful!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It'll be OK next time, Princess
Peach.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You just need to watch your
step a little, Princess.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It doesn't look like you can get
out through this door.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A rather large fireplace.
The fire feels quite warm.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Princess Peach's dresses.
Her favorite outfits!♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A photo of Mario.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A soft and comfortable bed.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A bouquet of Princess Peach's
favorite flowers.♥
It smells incredible.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems to be locked.
You can't open it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hello? Is anyone in here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh noo! I'm caught for sure!

... Huh!?
Princess Peach! You're OK!
Thank the Stars!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You're a Toad from the castle?
How long have you been hiding in
here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, since Bowser took over.
I was so scared of being caught
that I jumped into this closet.

I'm hiding here until Mario comes
and saves us all.

Princess Peach, you ought to
hide too! It's risky out there!
Please don't take any chances!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nobody's in here! Go away!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Nothing in here but clothes!
Please don't open... Oh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh!? Mario!?

... Oh, sweet!!
You came to save me, right?

Phew... I was so scared...

Thanks for coming!

While you're here, would you like
to take a quick nap?

I'll wake you if anyone bad comes
in, I swear it.

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh!? Mario!?

... Oh, sweet!!
You came to save me, right?

Phew... I was so scared...

Thanks for coming!

While you're here, would you like
to take a quick nap?

Oh... Actually... You look fine.

You could take a nap anyway.
What do you say?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Toad House slogan is...
"Refresh your Body and Soul!"

Tee hee hee... I always wanted
to say that.

Would you like to take a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
... ?
You look healthy to me.
Still, you're the boss. Are you
sure you want a nap?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Good luck!
I'll be rooting for you, Mario... 
from in here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Please enjoy your rest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you sleep well?

Good luck, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! Look there!
What a beautifully crafted
treasure chest!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, do you like it?

This is a mysterious treasure
chest that's been passed down
through generations of my family
here at the castle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Really? How mysterious.
A mysterious treasure chest...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's right. This chest is
connected to another mysterious
treasure chest somewhere in the
Mushroom Kingdom.

They say you can put things in
this chest and take them out of
the other chest. Isn't that, well,
mysterious?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah! Wow, that's really cool.
So, where is the other treasure
chest, anyway?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Err... Where IS it...?
You know, I can't remember!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is that mysterious treasure
chest, isn't it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yes, Twink. It is.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So if I have this right, you can
put something in here and
someone can take it out of the
other one, right?

You know, maybe Mario could get
whatever you put in here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yeah, maybe he could! What can I
put in?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You put in {x}
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

perhaps just one little one?
Could you borrow the book 
"Koopa Legends" from Kolorado?

I'm certain if you were to ask 
Kolorado's wife, she'd lend it.

If it isn't a trouble, please
go there as soon as possible.
You promise, young fella?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Great galloping Goombas!
You're a lifesaver, Mario!

This is just what I needed!
Hee hee hee hee...

To show my gratitude, I'd like
to make a gift of this.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
For Peach's sake!!
You're a miracle worker, Mario!
Stupendous! Exceptional!

This is exactly what I wanted!
Hee hee hee hee...

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa a favor.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

lately I've been sleeping poorly.
I'd love a Sleepy Sheep to help
me catch a little shut-eye.

There should be a shop in 
Toad Town that sells 'em.

If it isn't a bother, hurry up
and get one, all right?
You promise, young fella?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My stars!
You're a veritable hero, Mario!

Finally, some peace and quiet!
Sweet dreams, here I come!
Hee hee hee hee...

Take this as a small thank-you.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Super Duper Blooper!
You're one of a kind, Mario!
Stupendous!

Now I needn't fear my pillow!
I hope my dreams are good...
Hee hee hee hee...

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I don't suppose you could go
to Goomba Village and find 
Goompa, the grandfather?

He still has a Tape I lent him
a while back. Could you get it
for me? I really want it.

If you say "The Tape", he'll
know what you're talking about.

Try to keep this whole thing
under wraps, would you?
You promise, young fella?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Suffering Shy Guys!
Mario, you're a real gent!

Did Goompa complain? Hee hee...
Take this as a gesture of my
eternal gratitude.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mother of Monty Mole!
How do you do it, Mario?
Marvelous! Glorious!

Did Goompa complain at all?

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I've got a hankering for some
Koopa Tea. It's the very best!
Fetch a bit for me, would you?

Koopa Tea can be made only with
a fresh Koopa Leaf, which you
can find in the village. Brewing
it requires a special technique.

Only a culinary master can make
this tea the proper way so that
it bursts with flavor.  

You know... I think young Miss
Tayce T. of Toad Town is quite
a tea brewmaster.

What do you say you run along
and bring some back piping hot?
I have your word, young fella?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Great Goomba!
You rock my shell, Mario!

Mmmmmmm! Oh, mercy! So very
succulent! You know, this tea is
equally tasty cold as it is
piping hot.

Take this as thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Great growling Gulpits!
You defy comparison, Mario!
Wondrous! Excellent!

Mmmm! This hits the spot!
You know, this tea is just as
delicious iced as it is hot.

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I have a secret wish to
get the great Luigi's autograph.
He's your brother, right?

That young fella is truly super!
Have you seen him jump? They
should call him "Air Luigi"!

If you could somehow get his
autograph, I'd be really happy.
Could you help, young fella?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hoppin' Hammer Brothers!
You're a wizard, Mario!

Wa ha ha ha...!
I have so many unique treasures
now! What a lucky Koopa I am!

Here! Take this and know that 
I'm very grateful.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By Tutankoopa's beard!
You always come through, Mario!
Supreme! Spectacular!

Wa ha ha ha...!
I have so many treasures to 
fondly remember now!

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

the other day, I went shopping
at Koopa's Shop in the village,

but on the way home, I must've
dropped my wallet on the road.
Look for it, would you?

My memory is kind of sketchy,
but I think I remember talking 
to that guy who listens to the
radio in front of his house.

I'm sure my wallet was with me
then, but after I got home I
realized it was gone.

I'm hyperventilating.
I must find that wallet!
Promise me you'll help?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank Star Haven!
You've saved me again, Mario!

You seem to have a nose for
finding things.

Take this as thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, thank the Star Spirits!
You're the bee's knees, Mario!
Wonderful! Just great!

You seem to have a nose for
finding things.

You're a stand-up guy for doing

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

If you find the time, I really
do have a craving for a 
Tasty Tonic. Most shops sell it.

It's my all-time favorite drink.
It really clears out the old
beak, yes indeed.

Fetch me a cold one, would you?
I'm parched over here!
I have your word, young fella?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pouring Piranhas!
You're like a psychic, Mario!

This is exactly what I wanted!

As a gesture of my gratitude 
and generosity, take this.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thundering Tuff Puffs!
You are truly tops, Mario!
Cool! Isn't that what kids say?

This'll really hit the spot!

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I've heard through the grapevine
that there's a beautiful fortune
teller living on Shooting Star
Summit.

so... if you would

I want you to hike up there
and ask her for an autograph.
I'm too shy...

Run along for me, now.
I can barely wait!
You promise to hurry?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Leaping Lava Buds!
How do you do it, Mario!?

Ohhh... Oh my...
What beautiful handwriting...♥

What must she be like?
Uh... I mean... I sure like
this autograph!

Here, take this as a token
of my thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Jumping Jungle Fuzzies!
You're peerless, Mario!
My word! Good gracious!

Ohhh... Oh my...
What beautiful handwriting...♥

Be still, my heart...
Uh... That is... This will be
the heart of my collection! 

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I'm not quite as mobile as I was
in my salad days, and as a
result I feel like I'm losing
touch with the outside world.

A newspaper would be the best
way for me to catch up, no?

Would you mind reading the Toad
Town News for me?

You could tell me the news then.
My eyes aren't so good, see?

Don't spare the juicy gossip,
either! I'm all ears!

Hurry up if you can.
I'm losing touch here!
Promise me you will?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Creeping Crazy Dayzees!
You're pure class, Mario!

Ah...so that's what's going on
in the world.

I'm not sure I believe all those
wild tales, but I suppose if you
say so...

It's nice to catch up on the
current lingo. I've had a hard 
time understanding youngsters
lately. Now I'm "hip."

Why don't you take this for
helping me?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bustling Buzzy Beetles!
How do you do it, Mario?!
Glory be!

I see...so that's what's going 
on these days.

It seems pretty dubious to me,
but the world is a crazy
place. Don't I know it!

It's nice to catch up on the 
times. I've barely been able
to understand what youngsters 
are talking about. Now I'm "hip."

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I've been ailing a bit lately.
I'd like to get a Life Shroom,
you know, to have on hand just
in case of an emergency.

I must have one! I must!
Please, please find one for me!
You should be able to find one
at select shops.

Please hurry--I'm not feeling
well at all.
You promise to return?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, by the musty Shroom!
You're a peach, Mario!

I feel ten times better,
and twenty years younger!
Maybe I'll go jog! After my nap.

Here, take this as thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yodeling Yoshis!
You're my savior, Mario!
Prime! Delectable!

I feel like a million coins!
I'm filled with vim and vigor!
And now, I believe I'll nap.

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I do have this sudden craving 
for one of Tayce T.'s 
scrumptious Nutty Cakes.

The secret ingredient is the
Goomnut, which grows on certain
trees.

If memory serves (which it
doesn't always) you can find 
them near someone's house...

I don't know if that helps, 
but you still have to find one
so Tayce T. can bake the cake.

I'm getting pretty famished,
actually. Would you hurry up?
Promise?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bouncing  Bob-ombs!
I owe you big time, Mario!

Oh... Oh, this is heavenly!
I'm nutty for this cake!

Here's a reward for you.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Spinning Spike Tops!
You're an angel, Mario!
Right on! Oh yeah!

Oh... Oh, this is too good!
I'm nutty for this cake!

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I must tell you, there's quite
a racket coming from next door.
It's far too loud! Say, you
and Kooper are friends, no?

Well, it's his house and he should
keep his guests from raising a
ruckus. I can't sleep with all
the noise!

Can you go over there and
complain for me? Just tell them
to put a lid on it.

Go as soon as you can--
I'm at the end of my rope.
Tell me when they quiet down.
I have your word?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Shrieking Swoopulas!
Nothing fazes you, Mario!

Ahh, sweet silence! I hope you
gave those hooligans what-for.

Now I can get some precious 
sleep and dream in peace. 
Hee hee hee hee...

I'm so grateful.
Why don't you take this from me?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Galavanting Groove Guys!
You're the man, Mario!
Amazing! Stunning!

Finally, some peace and quiet!
Did those punks make a fuss?

Now I can finally go back to 
sweet dreamland.
Hee hee hee hee...

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I've been hearing people talk
recently. Apparently I'm not
so popular. People are actually
saying I'm cheap! The nerve!

A long time ago, I used to
be like you.........and....

...........................
..............and then.....
...., you know,.........but

can you believe............
........... so I said......
................ and then..

........, you know, .......
completely unfair..........

.................and .....
so very rude..............
......despite my..........

..and finally.............
Hey, are you listening to me?

Well, the upshot is I don't
really need any help. Except...

You know all those Boos living 
in Boo Mansion? Well, one of 
them has an old photo of mine.

So... Well...
I'd like you to ask them if
they'd give it back.

And if you don't mind, could
you hurry up about it?
You promise you'll go?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Great Clomping Clubbas!
I'm in awe of you, Mario!

Oh, the days of my youth!
Just look at me there, so 
young and vibrant! I was quite
the ladies Koopa, you know.

There was................
..this utterly gorgeous..
...lovely................
........the passion......

.........................
maddening................
.........as fast as I....
..and I never looked back.

Anyway, enough of that. Take
this as a token of my thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Prickly Pokey pack!
You're unstoppable, Mario!
Oh, yes! Yes indeed!

Oh, the days of my youth!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I really haven't had a tasty
meal in a Goomba's age.
Miss Tayce T.'s Koopasta would
really hit the spot right now.

Could you head to Toad Town
and have her whip up a batch?
Did you hear my belly grumble?

I'm ravenous! Please hurry up!
Please don't let me starve!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Plummeting Paragoombas!
You're a man of action, Mario!

This looks simply delicious!

I swear, nobody should cook
this dish besides Tayce T.
She's perfected the recipe!

Here's a little token of my
gratitude.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dastardly Duplighosts!
What's your secret, Mario?!
Oh my! Unbelievable!

It looks good enough to eat!

It should be forbidden for
anyone besides Tayce T. to 
cook this. It's perfect!

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I seem to have misplaced my 
glasses, which is vexing.
I suppose I must have dropped
them somewhere.

I haven't gone beyond the 
borders of Koopa Village,
so, logic suggests that they're
somewhere in the village.

Could you drop what you're 
doing and find them?
I have your word, young fella?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hopping Hurt Plant!
You're a master sleuth, Mario!

My eyesight's really gone downhill
these last years...
Now I can once again read books
without any trouble.

Technology's great, isn't it?

Here. I'll give you this to show
my gratitude.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By the biting Bzzap!
I'm stunned, Mario!
Awe-inspiring! Smashing!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I've really been dragging my 
shell recently. I need a tart
pick-me-up.

Let's see... Oh, I know! A fresh
Lime should do the trick.
Can you go find one?

Hurry up, if you could. I feel
as slow as a tortoise.
Do you promise?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By Whacka's Bump!
You can't be mortal, Mario!

Mmmmm.... Yow!
What a sour Lime!
That'll put a spring in my step!

Here, take this as a token
of my thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
By Spiny's spikes!
Are you for real, Mario?
Mind-blowing! Crazy!

Mmmmm... Yow!
What a sour lime!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I recently heard about a snack
called a Kooky Cookie. It's
supposedly delicious.

I must confess that I have a 
sweet tooth. So...do you think
you could track one down?

One of the ingredients is a 
Koopa Leaf but I have no idea
what the other one is.

Hurry up, if you can.
I need sweets, posthaste!
Do I have your word, young man?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lines o' Albino Dinos!
You're world class, Mario!

So this is the cookie everyone
raves about. It does look good!
I think I'll save it for later.

I'll give you this gift to show
my gratitude.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Twisted Tumble Thwomps!
You are unreal, Mario!
Tremendous! Radical!

So this is the cookie everyone
raves about. It does look good!
I think I'll save it for later.

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

There is one thing. I have an
old Boo friend who lives in
Gusty Gulch. Can you go and get
a package from him?

You may have a little trouble
finding him, since the Boos 
there look pretty similar.
I'm sure you can do it, though.

A long time ago, when Goompa, 
Bootler, and I were traveling, 
we met the Boo and became
fast friends.

He recently sent me a letter 
saying that there is a package
there addressed to me.

What are you waiting for?
Go on and get it!
I mean... Please?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Livid Lava Piranhas!
You rule, Mario!

Ah yes!
This is that package
I requested!

Ever since my Boo friend sent
me that letter I've been dying
to know what's inside.

Well, I'll find out right now!
...After you leave.

Here, take this as thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Great gobs of Goomnuts!
You're a real champ, Mario!
Simply brilliant!

Ah yes!
This is that package
I requested!
Ever since my Boo friend sent
me that letter I've been dying
to know what's inside.

Well, I'll find out right now!
...After you leave.

You're a stand-up guy for doing

special gift as thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

People keep talking about
something called a Coconut.

They say they're delicious.
I just have to try one!

Go right away, if you can.
Promise to hurry back?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Great crawling Clefts!
You're larger than life, Mario!

Mmmmm...
How do you crack this thing?
Ah well. I guess I'll try it later.

I'll give you this to show
my gratitude.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stampeding Stone Chomps!
You're super, Mario!
Masterful! Top notch!

Mmmmm...
How do you crack this thing?
Ah well. I guess I'll try it later.

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Well then, young fella! I don't
usually ask for favors, but...

I wouldn't mind getting one of
those Red Jars that they say
were made in Dry Dry Desert's
ancient desert kingdom.

According to popular opinion,
you can get one if you buy 
things in a certain order at 
the shop in Dry Dry Outpost.

First you buy a Dusty Hammer,
then you go ahead and get a 
Dried Pasta, then...er...you
get another Dusty Hammer

and then... Let me see...
Hang on... I've forgotten the
other thing...

...
Aaaaa! Well, you'll have to 
figure out the rest.

But do hurry. I really want one.
Do I have your word?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Levitating Lakitus!
You're tops in my book, Mario!

Eew...it's a little filthy, though.
I suppose I'll add it to my
collection anyway.

Here, take this as a token of
my eternal thanks.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Swooping Sky Guys!
You're a true workhorse, Mario!
Incredible! Outstanding!

Eew...it's a little filthy, though.
I suppose I'll add it to my
collection anyway.

You're a stand-up guy for doing
an old Koopa so many favors.

This time, I'll give you this
special gift as thanks.
Don't tell anybody, though.
I've got a reputation to keep.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My dear Mario!
You've done me so many favors 
and never complained. Please 
know I'll always be grateful.

I do have one last request, 
though, and it's the toughest.

Defeat the Evil King, Bowser!
Defeat him at all costs!

As long as he rules, the village
children will never feel truly
safe.

Even a selfish old Koopa like
me wants the village to prosper.
Please, Mario! You can do it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

So it is told that far away,
at the very top of the sky,
there exists a Star Haven,
where Stars make their home.

In Star Haven, there's a
treasure called a Star Rod.
According to legend, it was made
with ancient magic.

There are said to be Stars that
are particulary strong and
good-hearted. They are called
Star Spirits.

Using the magical Star Rod,
these Star Spirits grant the
wishes of everyone in this world.

That's why, when we make a wish
to the night sky and it comes 
true, it's all thanks to the Star
Spirits and their Star Rod.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Now, if you will, how about a
little timely information on how
to operate the controls.  

Move the Control Stick and
press the {Z} Button to spin
and run. That, my friend, is a
Spin Dash.

Also, when you talk to somebody,
you can press {Z} to go back and
read the previous message again.

Hmm, let's see. Ah! If you press
{▲} while out and about, the
amount of HP, FP, Star Points,
and Coins will be shown.

And what else...
If you move the Control Stick
slightly, Mario walks slowly and
quietly.

Sometimes it's good to walk
slowly rather than always 
running, don't you know.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

If you go east from the place
where Princess Peach's Castle 
used to be, you'll find a place 
called Shooting Star Summit.

At the foot of the summit live
Merluvlee and her brother,
Merlow.

The older sister, Merluvlee, can
see things you're looking for by
fortune-telling.

The hobby of the younger
brother, Merlow, is collecting
Star Pieces.

If you take him Star Pieces,
he'll swap them for Badges.

In point of fact, these two 
are the granddaughter and 
grandson of Merlon, who tells
fortunes in Toad Town.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

There is a message board on
the side of Merlon's house that 
posts news.

It would appear that many
people enjoy scribbling on the
back of the message board.

Indeed, various things are
always written on it.

You may want to take a quick
look occasionally. Sometimes 
you'll read interesting news.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Have you seen any Candy Canes?
They're those striped objects 
growing beside Pleasant Path. 

They're mysterious objects.
Nobody knows anything about 
them. Even I don't!

There are rumors, though...
Many believe that if you do
something for the Candy Canes,
you'll be rewarded later.

Why don't you investigate?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

In Koopa Village, there lives a
selfish village senior named
Koopa Koot.

This old Koopa Koot
stops passers-by and asks
them for favors. Or so
I've heard, anyway.

And yet, they say that even
if you meet his requests, he 
gives you only one coin.

But it's been rumored that
every once in a while, he gives
out something good.
Who knows what he might have...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I remember reading something 
interesting in a book recently.

It seems there are three blocks
laid on the ground somewhere on
Pleasant Path.

And then...what was it?
Ah! When you do something to
the blocks, supposedly you can
receive something good.

Unfortunately, the book was 
quite vague on what to do. 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Do you know about Fire Bars?
You know, those flaming
obstacles that spin round and
round?   

They're terribly dangerous and
you'll be burned if you touch one.

According to a brilliant book
I read some time ago, there's a
way to beat them.

But if you can't touch them,
how do you beat them? Maybe
the book wasn't so brilliant...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

In our fair land, there are 
several radio stations to listen
to.

If you occasionally check the
radio, you might just hear some
useful information.

I've heard that someone in
Koopa Village has a radio,
so why don't you ask if you
could have a listen?

Actually, one of the radio
stations, FM Shroom, will soon
be celebrating its 10th
anniversary. Sounds exciting!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Have you seen that Chet Rippo
character around Toad Town?

I've heard rumors that if you
talk to him, he will increase 
one of your point levels. 

But be careful, because when
he increases one of the point
levels, the other two levels will
go down a wee bit.

So I would suggest giving the
matter a lot of thought before
committing to the deal.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

There are tales of long ago,
when thieves ruled the far-off
land of Dry Dry Desert.

These robbers collected things 
from all over the desert and 
hid them in various places.

I've heard of one of these 
hiding places, a block lying
somewhere in Dry Dry Desert. 

When you hit the block once,
a ? Block appears.

But that's not all. Oh no!
When you hit it ten times,
another ? Block shows up!

This is but one of the rumors
about hidden loot in the desert.
Thieves thrived there, and I bet
they had many hiding places.

If you find yourself in Dry Dry
Desert, I would suggest that
you take the time to look around
for treasures.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

At the edge of Dry Dry Desert,
there's a dusty old town called
Dry Dry Outpost.

Somewhere in this Dry Dry
Outpost, there's supposedly
a female wizard.

If she casts a spell on you,
something good may happen 
during battles.
Why don't you give it a try?

By the way, this wizard is said
to be the twin sister of
Merluvlee, the fortune-teller
from Shooting Star Summit.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

There's a place called
Mt. Rugged. Trust me, there is.

On this mountain, a very rare
creature called Whacka lives. 

If you hit a Whacka, something
called a Whacka's Bump will
appear. It's very valuable.

It's been said that if you eat
one, you'll be instantly filled
with energy.
But...

It's rather sad, actually...
Even though Whackas are kind,
people keep pummeling them to
get the Whacka's Bumps.

That's why the number of
Whackas on Mt. Rugged has been
declining.

In fact, there's a rumor that
there's only one left.
The last Whacka...how tragic.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Near Toad Town Station, there's
supposed to be a Playroom.

But it's apparently closed to
non-members, which seems
pretty rude, if you ask me.

On top of that, even if you find
the place, you still need a
membership card to play the
games in there!

I like to play games as much as
the next Toad! But I have no
idea how to get a membership
card.

Hmm...You know...

I've heard that Koopa Koot of
Koopa Village is a member of the
Playroom...

That old Koopa Koot might know
something more about it.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I once read that a so-called
Mysterious Treasure Chest lies
in Princess Peach's Castle.

Apparently it's one of a pair.

When you put something in one of
the treasure chests, someone
can take it out of the other one.

That's a pretty exceptional
treasure chest, isn't it?

A long, long time ago, this chest
was given to one of Princess
Peach's ancestors by the Star
Spirits.

According to the book I read,
there's only one treasure chest
in Princess Peach's Castle.

Where in the world could the
other one be?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You do, of course, know that
Forever Forest is east of town.

It's a bit of a weird place.
I've heard that ghosts have
been known to haunt it, so you
may want to steer clear.

If you do want to go through
the forest for whatever reason,
it's vital that you find the
correct path.

To find the right one, look for
scenery that differs a bit from
the other scenery in the area
and follow the path nearby.

According to a rumor I heard,
there's sometimes a hidden path
in addition to the right one.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Throughout the world, I've
heard, there are chambers
hidden in the ground.

If the ground near one of the
chambers gets a big shock,
a hidden panel pops up

and a Star Piece shoots out
from the ground below.
You ought to keep an eye out
for these chambers, Mario.

Say, that reminds me...
I heard that there's a Badge
with the power to warn you when
you're near a secret.

If you found this Badge, it'd
be easier to find the chambers.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

There's a grim guy called
Anti-Guy who guards a special
treasure chest...

According to a book I read a
while back, he absolutely loves
Lemon Candy.

If you take one to Anti-Guy,
he might mellow out a bit.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Some enemies will attack the
party member who's with you,
Mario. Remember, your friends
are in the battle, too!

In a battle, you can defend your
friend by pushing {A} at the right
time, just like you do to defend
yourself, Mario.

It's a simple technique, but it
helps protect your pals.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Did you know that when you
attack enemies in the field,
you'll get in a First Strike
during the battle that follows?

When you strike, if you Spin
Jump or attack with Bombette
or Kooper, you'll hurt enemies
more than usual.

Sure, it's a minor technique,
but every little bit helps.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You may see symbols above
enemies in the battle sequences.

These mean that the enemy can
make you dizzy, put you to
sleep, or call in some
reinforcements.

When you see those enemies,
you should try to paralyze them
or put them to sleep before
they do it to you.

The battle will be much easier
if you can make it so your
enemies can't move.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Prices for goods go up and down
depending on which shop you
go to.

Of course, it's smarter for you
to buy items at a cheaper shop.
Be a bargain hunter! 

You know, if you're a real 
go-getter, you can even sell
items you buy at one shop to
another shop.

If you have good business sense,
you may just make a profit.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Ever been to Li'l-Oinks Farm,
near Toad Town Station?

On that Farm, no more than
ten Li'l-Oinks can be in the pen
at one time, so

when the 11th comes, the first
Li'l-Oink runs away and leaves
the farm.

Whenever a Li'l-Oink runs off,
it drops an item. The item
dropped depends on what kind
of Li'l-Oink it was.

Of course, whenever you take
one of these items, other
Li'l-Oinks will also leave the
farm.

To grab the item or not to grab
the item...
that is the question.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

If you take a Koopa Leaf and
Dried Pasta to Ms. Tayce T.,

she will make some scrumptious
spaghetti for you.

That dish is actually a
traditional one, a classic handed
down in Koopa Village through
many generations.

Why don't you try it once, Mario?
Come on! You'll love it!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Do you know of the Yoshis that
live on Lavalava Island in the
South Ocean?

Perhaps because their tropical
island is so colorful, the Yoshis
themselves are of many different
colors. 

It seems they have different
personalities, depending on 
their body colors.

They all love food, but Yellow 
Yoshis seem to really delight
in delicacies.

Next time you see a Yellow Yoshi,
try giving it something delicious.
Trust me--it'll be happy.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You know a Koopa called Mr.
Kolorado, the famous explorer
and archaeologist?

I have nothing but respect for
him. Solving the riddle of the
Candy Canes on Pleasant Path,

investigating Dry Dry Ruins
in Dry Dry Desert, discovering
many new facts..these are but
a few of his accomplishments.

Recently, he found a treasure
that proves an ancient
civilization once existed on
Lavalava Island.

According to Mr. Kolorado,
a long time ago, people once
lived on Lavalava Island.

I heard that these people used
to live in the holes dug out of
the side of the volcano on
Lavalava Island.

But they they were forced to  
flee the island because the
volcano became very active.

Even he couldn't find out what
kind of people they were or
where they escaped to.

Long after these mysterious
people left the island, Yoshis
and Ravens arrived, and they've
lived in harmony ever since.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Do you know a giant Koopa called
Kent C. Koopa?

A long time ago, it seems this
gent lived in Koopa Village.

At the time, they say
Kent C. Koopa often trained
with four village Koopas.

Kent C. Koopa was amazingly
strong, so he always beat the
team of Koopas.

Strong as he was, I've heard
from some village residents that
even Kent C. Koopa had a few
weak points, though.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

There should be a place called
Flower Fields hidden somewhere
in the world.

A very rare Crazee Dayzee,
called an Amazy Dayzee, is said
to live there.

I heard that this Amazy Dayzee
is so timid that it runs away
when it sees anyone.

If you glimpse it,
count yourself lucky.
I'd sure like to see it once.

Even if you miss it the first
time, you might see the
Amazy Dayzee if you visit the
same place again.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

It's a known fact that Miss
Tayce T. is the best cook
around. Everyone says so.

I've had the good fortune to
try many of her dishes, and
believe me, they're heavenly.

If I had to pick a favorite,
it would be her Yoshi Cookie.

According to Tayce T.,
the recipe calls for Cake Mix
and a Melon.

Try it if you get the chance.
I highly recommend it.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

I just heard a rumor...
Apparently, there's a shop
somewhere under Toad Town.

I can only wonder what kind of
goods they sell there.

Some folks are saying you can
find real bargains there, while
others have been ripped off.
Who's telling the truth?

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

In hot climates, Snowman Dolls
seem to sell very well.
It makes sense that warm folks
want cold goods, right?

On the other hand, people who
live in cold areas pay dearly
for Fire Flowers.

One could make quite a profit
if one bought and sold wisely.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Koopa Village folk adore any
food that has a bit of
Koopa Leaf mixed in it.

Koopa Leaf is an extremely
delicate ingredient, so unless
you cook it correctly, it won't
taste very good.

In these dark times, there are
only a couple of people in the
world who can successfully make
Koopa Leaf dishes.

I recall a shopkeeper at Koopa
Village complaining about this...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

According to the vast stores of
information I've gathered,

there appear to be soldiers
called the Koopatrol guarding
Bowser's Castle.

They're nasty. And moreover,
you can't jump stomp on them
because they're fitted with
special spiked armor.

There are creatures called
Bony Beetles as well. They can
also extend sharp spikes.

When you head to Bowser's
Castle, I would recommend that
you take along a Spike Shield
Badge, if you have one.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

You know a fellow called Goompa
in Goomba Village?

In olden times, he used to be a
famous fighter.

His name is all over the copy of
the Fighter's Almanac that I
happen to own.

He was an unrivaled champion.
He'd knock out his enemies
one after another using his
greatest move, the Multibonk.

When he was younger, he
traveled the world, looking for
someone to challenge him.

In fact, Goompa taught the 
Dojo Master here in town.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

In the frozen heights of the
north, there's an icy peak
named Shiver Mountain.

Legend has it that deep in the
mountain is a mystical fortress
called the Crystal Palace.

The existence of the Palace has
faded from people's memory.

In this day and age, nobody
remembers where it is or how to
get there.

You can see why folks call it a
phantom palace.

There is hope, though...
According to my sources, the
famed archaeologist Kolorado

has immediate plans to search
for and rediscover the legendary
crystal structure.

How exciting! Ah, to be young
and adventurous again!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Just the other day, I was
fortunate enough to read the
most fascinating book.
This book said, and I quote...

"...the Evil King chortles, and
a sacred rod and seven lights 
fade into darkness. A lovely 
maiden rises to the heavens.

"But lo! A hero clad in red
appears and travels the world.
He gathers around him eight
who are pure of heart.

"This hero restores the seven
lights, and they raise him high 
into the sky.

"On the airy heights, the hero
clashes with the Evil King.
The lovely maiden wishes..."

That's how it ended!

Somebody had torn out the rest
of the pages! Now I'll never
know the ending! What kind of
no-good tears up books!?!

I think I have heard of this kind
of story but I'm not sure where
I read it...

    What Shy Guy Problem?
   Mario Trounces Thieves

The little larceny-lovers known
as Shy Guys have finally quit
terrorizing the town.

Mario tracked them to their Toy
Box hideout, valiantly dispersed
their ranks,

and managed to rescue an
imprisoned Star Spirit.


To those who would prey on the
innocent and weak, we say this:
Mario will prevail!

  A Whale of a Story

The small island that appeared
recently in the harbor has
turned out to be an ailing whale
from the deeps.
Apparently the whale was
floating there, trying to quell
a stomachache caused by a hairy
caterpillar it swallowed.
Mario saved the caterpillar,
which had been used as bait by
a fisherman. Both whale and
caterpillar felt lots better.
All's "whale" that ends "whale"!

       Pleasant Path
  to Become a Toll Road?!

An enormous Koopa Troopa has
parked himself on Pleasant Path
between Koopa Village and Toad
Town.
The huge creature, who is
apparently calling himself
Kent C. Koopa, demands coins
from every passing traveler.
If the traveler refuses, this
brute blocks the way with his
enormous body.

We must stop this extortion
as soon as possible!

For now, we would suggest that
you take some coins with you

Door to Another World Opens
  In Center of Toad Town

Behind an unremarkable door
that appeared in the center
of Minh T.'s flower garden,
a flower world seems to exist.
Toad Town officials are
considering a scouting team


but there's probably no point,
as Mario has already stepped
through. We await word from him.

  Volcano Blows its Lid on
     Lavalava Island
  Mario Escapes Molten Magma
A little while ago we reported on
new volcanic activity erupting on
an island in the South Sea.
Mt. Lavalava on Lavalava Island
was the volcano in question.

We recently received a report
from Kolorado, the famed
archaeologist who journeyed into
the volcano with Mario.
He states that Bowser's minions
were behind the seismic tremors
that caused the volcano to
violently erupt.
At great risk to life and limb,
Mario made a daring rescue of
the Star Spirit that was held
in the fiery depths.
Mario...he's on fire!!!

Interdimensional Door

    Another World, Same Story
A world populated by flowers
lies on the other side of the
mysterious door in Minh T.'s
flower garden.
It should come as no surprise to
learn that Bowser's goons were
causing trouble there.

But guess what? Our own Mario
did a little extermination of the
pests in that garden!

By kicking Bowser's underlings
out of the world, he also saved
another Star Spirit!
Now that's flower power!

and discovered the legendary
Crystal Palace at the top of
Shiver Mountain.

This Palace is said to have been
built and dedicated to the Star
Spirits.

Bowser's evil followers, however,
had taken it over.


Mario put those goons on ice and

This is the west entrance to
Toad Town. In case you couldn't
tell, it's the main gate.

The fancy gate and the star
emblem on the ground are symbols
of this fair town.  

Goomba Village, where my house
is, is a brief journey west from
here.

You'll find a very smart Toad
named Russ T. living in this town.

He knows lots of useful
information for adventurers.

You'll also find shops that sell
various items.
Oh yeah! There's also a Dojo.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the central area of Toad
Town, a plaza in front of
Princess Peach's Castle.

Pleasant Path begins to the
east of here.

This used to be a bustling area
before Bowser's attack. Guests
at the castle were always in
and out.

And tourists came from all over
to see the castle.

The wizard Merlon also lives
around here. If you get stuck,
his fortune-telling might just
help you out!

There's also a Toad House where
you can take a short rest and
a post office where you can pick
up mail for your party members.

Also, over by the flower garden,
there's a guy named Rowf who's
opening his own specialty shop.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Miss. Tayce T., a famous local
cook, lives around here.

I'm pretty sure my mom wants to
learn cooking from her.
Tayce T. will cook for you if you
take ingredients to her.

Oh yeah! Forever Forest lies to
the east,

so a Toad watchman stands guard
there and prevents people from
wandering in.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's Toad Town Station.

It's a station for the Dry Dry
Railroad. From there, you can
take the train to scenic
Mt. Rugged.

And there's also Oink-Oink Farm,
where they raise Li'l-Oinks.
Raising Li'l-Oinks costs coins.

My dad said there's a Playroom 
here, but I don't see it...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the residential area of
Toad Town. It's mostly homes.
But there's also a shop.

For Toad Town, this area is
pretty quiet.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Toad Town's port. It's
home to the only restaurant in
town.

I like to stand at the end of
the pier and gaze at the sea.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the reception area for
the Playroom.
You should ask what kind of
games they have, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's called Jump Attack.
If you win the game, you'll collect
lots of coins.

If you lose, you won't get a
thing. Too bad!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
They said this is called Smash
Attack.
The idea is to whack the blocks
placed on the floor.

Let's get in there and smash all
of 'em! But...
Actually, it may not be a good
idea to hit them all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Peach's Castle... 
used to be here.

There's not even a trace of it
now. How awful!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Peach's Castle.
But we just came out of
Bowser's Castle! I've got a
funny feeling about this...

I wonder where Princess Peach
is being held captive.
I think we should brace
ourselves, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the first floor hall of
Princess Peach's Castle.

There are so many doors, though.
Where on earth can Princess
Peach be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the second floor hall of
Princess Peach's Castle.

There are so many doors, though.
Where on earth can Princess
Peach be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a covered hallway in Peach's
Castle, Mario.
Let's find Bowser and save
Princess Peach!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We have to help Princess Peach!!
Mario! Hurry up! Let's move!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! This is Princess Peach's
room, isn't it? It smells great
in here!

It's such a cheerful room,
just like Princess Peach.

I can't believe she was locked up
in here for so long, all by
herself. She must've been so
lonely...

We've got to rescue her,
right now!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is just an ordinary room.

Do you smell something, though?
What a strange odor...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! So many books.

If we weren't in the middle of
such an adventure, I'd love to
read some of these.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This looks like a storeroom.

...!
Hey! Check out that box! Let's
see what's in it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a dining room.

It looks like somebody has eaten
here recently.
Probably not the princess--
they're probably starving her!

People always say that the meals
served here are delectable.
I'd love to eat here sometime.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a kitchen.
I'm just guessing, but I bet this
is where they make the meals.

The castle's head chef probably
cooks all the meals, don't you
think?

I wonder what kinds of savory
dishes he knows how to make.
Hey, Mario...
Have you ever eaten here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a pretty huge drawer
over there.
I bet a person could fit inside!
If they wanted to, that is...

Hey, there's a bed, too!
This must be a guest room.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, what happened here? This
is even messier than my room
back home!

It looks like nobody ever puts
anything away in here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bowser's gone upstairs.
C'mon, we have to follow him!
Mario, let's roll!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We have to save the princess!!
Hurry up!
Mario! There's no time to waste!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a castle tower.
These long spiral stairs go up
and up and around and around.
Oog...I feel dizzy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Huh?
Where in the world did Bowser
just disappear to?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This balcony has a great view.
I'm betting that this is one of
the princess's favorite places.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This place feels strange and
mysterious, doesn't it?

If we go east from here, we'll
eventually get to Shooting Star
Summit.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Shooting Star Summit.
Stars are really...uh, shooting.

People say that this place,
like no other, reaches up and
embraces the sky.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This must be... Yes! This is the
legendary Star Way!

It's a path formed out of actual
stars.
It's absolutely beautiful!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Star Haven.
This place is so peaceful!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This building...
No, not building... This palace
is incredible! Look at this
architecture, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everything seems to be shining
and glittering in here. I feel
like I should shield my eyes or
something.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the house of an amazingly
gorgeous woman, the fortune-
teller Merluvlee.

Merlow, who collects Star Pieces,
also lives here.

This house pulses with psychic
power. Can you feel it?

It feels...weird. It feels like
I'm floating on some sort of
spiritual cushion.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're in Toad Town Tunnels.
Eew... I wonder what's making
the water drip from up there?

At best, I guess this place
could be called "damp". Although
"dank" is more like it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh! I wonder where this filthy
water is going?
This'd better not drain into the
sea or the river!

I may have to alert the Goomba 
Environmental Board!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Let's see...disgusting flows
of water...dripping ceilings...
Yup, it's gross down here!

Can we leave now?
I... I'm really uncomfortable.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a strange platform.
What do you think'll happen if
we climb on board?

Are you worried about where the
platform will end up? That's
never stopped you before...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The cool air is certainly nice and
refreshing,

but it's too dark, it smells awful
and I have a bad feeling about
this place. Let's move!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah, Toad Town Tunnels!
Visit its scenic filthy streams
that lead to who-knows-where!

It's spectacularly disgusting!
Come stay awhile! If you're not
totally grossed out the first
night, you stay for free!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a strange, dark place.

Who'd think that a place like this
could exist beneath lovely old
Toad Town?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh... I think this is a sewer.
You know...the Toad Town sewer.
Under Toad Town.

What am I saying? You know!
You're a plumber, after all!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, gross!
I've never seen so much sewage
in my life!

Eew...floating garbage, too!
Talk about disgusting!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sure that some nasty things
live down here in the dark.

We should be ready to defend
ourselves in case of a surprise
attack.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, I really don't like foul
water dripping on me.

Ugh! That one hit the back of my
neck! Bleah! Where's it dripping
from?

Can we get out of here or what?
I hate it here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where are we...?

Are we lost or what? We've been
down here so long... You know,
I didn't know that adventuring
would be this gross.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, who could live down here?
What a crazy dude!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The tunnel is freezing!

I should've worn a sweater!
What do you say we go someplace
a bit warmer?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, even though these
tunnels have many sections
you can always count on one
thing: filthy, stinking water.

Would it be too much to ask to
get out of here before the
stench knocks me out?
Seriously! I'm about to wig out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a room beneath the Toad
Town pond.
I don't think anyone's been here
for a long time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, gross! Look, Mario!
The water's filthy!
And look! Garbage!

These tunnels are a total
nightmare. Let's keep moving 
and get out fast.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It just keeps getting grosser
down here, huh, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a small room with a single
pipe in the center.
Don't quote me, but I'm betting
that the pipe goes somewhere.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Still Toad Town Tunnels...

We've been in these tunnels so
long that it's starting to feel
like... 
I'm becoming a mole♥ ...ha ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like just another
passage in the tunnels.
I get the feeling...

that something valuable rests
around here...
Can't you feel it in your bones?
Do Goombas have bones?

Anyway, something big is near...
I'm almost positive.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
"It smells of treasure here."

How was that?
That was my Kolorado imitation.
Any good? Mario? Hello?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
According to Goombaria,
this is where you landed.

Something about this clearing
feels weird. I can't really say
exactly what, though...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Goomba Village.
My family lives here.

There's also a Toad House, which,
as you probably know, is a good
place to take a rest.

That big tree near my house is a
great place to get Goomnuts.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These are the woods behind my
house.

Until a little while ago,
Goombaria and I used to play
hide-and-seek here...

But there have been a lot of
evil Goombas and Paragoombas
spotted in the area, so Mom
doesn't let us play anymore.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think this is Jr. Troopa's
secret base.

That crazy kid!
Whenever I try to explore in
there, he freaks out.
He needs to chill.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These are the woods behind my
house.
Careful! There are many bad
Goombas around here.

Sorry... I'm sure that you can
probably take care of yourself,
huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Did you know...
...there are good Goombas and
bad Goombas?

A bad Goomba will try to pick
a fight with us the second it
spots us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look, Mario!
There's a Save Block.
Might be a good idea to use it,
don't you think?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If we go east a bit farther,
we'll find a bridge.

Once we cross it, we'll be a hop,
skip and a jump away from Toad
Town.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There're lots of bad Goombas
around these parts.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think there was a bridge
between Toad Town and Goomba
Village.

If we head east, we'll get to
Toad Town. If we head west,
we'll come to my house in Goomba
Village.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah, the outskirts of Toad Town.

To the east is Toad Town.
If we go west, we'll reach my
hometown, Goomba Village.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's your house!
Cool! Nice landscaping!

I like my house, but yours is even
nicer. Did you do the decorating
yourself?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To the west of here is Toad
Town,
and to the east is Koopa Village.

If we go even farther east,
we'll eventually reach Koopa
Bros. Fortress.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's always pleasant around
here. That's why we call this
place Pleasant Path.
It's nice and warm today, too.

Incidentally, lots of Koopas
live around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Koopas like to live around
Pleasant Path because there's
plenty of water for them to
lounge in.

Koopa Village is down this way.

If you want to go to Koopa
Bros. Fortress, we should take
the upper path and just keep
going straight.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Koopa Village.
Big surprise! Koopas live here.

Recently it seems like some
Bob-ombs have moved here, too.
They must have run away from
the fortress, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The house with the yellowish
roof is the home of the famous
archaeologist and explorer,
Kolorado.

Kolorado's always running from
one mysterious place to another
in order to do research.

He's really well respected in his
field.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We'd better be careful. There
are supposedly lots of Fuzzies
around this area.

Usually they stay hidden, but
lately they're more aggressive.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This part of the forest is the
Fuzzies' main stronghold.

The woods would actually be
quite beautiful if not for the 
Fuzzies. The light's nice...

Do you think Koopas do the
logging around here?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If we continue along the pass,
we should reach Koopa Bros.
Fortress.

Many Koopas and Paratroopas
live around here. If they're 
loyal to Bowser, they'll
definitely attack us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Just east of here, we can see
Koopa Bros. Fortress.

Actually, we're probably already
on fortress grounds.

That arch certainly looks like
part of it. And there are lots
of bad guys, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's Koopa Bros. Fortress.
This used to be ruined, but I
guess the Koopa Bros. rebuilt it.

It looks pretty huge, huh?
And solid, too.

This fortress was originally 
built around the same time the 
Bob-ombs took up residence on
Pleasant Path.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's pretty chilly inside this
fortress, isn't it?
It must be because there's so
much water inside.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This fortress stays cool all the
time because it's built entirely
of stone.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This seems to be the central
area of the fortress.
This area looks extremely
suspicious to me.

I wonder what all these gates
guard, don't you, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard there are many tricky
parts of this castle.

I wonder who built it.
It's pretty curious looking.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This place is pretty huge.
Before the Koopa Bros. came
here, this place used to be
filled with Bob-ombs. 

I don't think the Bob-ombs
built it, but they became its
caretakers. 

Of course,
they explode all the time, so
you can see why there are so
many cracked walls.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like they turned this
large chamber into a prison cell.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems strange to keep so
much water in the building.

Do you think it's here to keep
Bob-ombs from burning the place
down? Or maybe it's just for
Koopas to bathe in.

I mean, it's nice that it keeps
the place so cool, but I'm still
suspicious...
Mario... Let's keep moving, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These fire bars are a menace!
They're hot to the touch. They'll
hurt you if you touch 'em.

Somebody said there's a way to 
destroy 'em. How do you think
we do that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, the air is refreshing up
here, huh?

And look at the view! Isn't that
Pleasant Path way down there? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the room where we fought
the Koopa Bros.

Those guys weren't so tough!
They certainly weren't a match 
for us, huh, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the Mt. Rugged Station
on the Dry Dry Railroad line.

Not much grows around here or
on the barren mountain.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a steep mountain!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Watch out for the sneaky Monty
Moles that are common to this
area.

They're dirty fighters. They pop
up from underground and chuck
rocks at people. The cowards!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Phew! Maybe we ought to take a
break! I didn't realize the road
up would be so rough!

Of course, as nice as it would
be to take five on a rock, you
have to watch yourself. Enemies
disguise themselves as rocks.

They're nasty and spiky, so keep
your eyes open.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...I'm exhausted.
Do we have to keep going? Can't
we chill for a bit?

Why'd this mountain have to be
so huge?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! We're pretty high up!
Ooog... I feel a little faint.

I never told you this before, but
I have a fear of heights.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the gateway between Mt.
Rugged and Dry Dry Desert.

If we head due east from here,
we'll eventually reach the town
called Dry Dry Outpost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So hot... I feel dizzy...
Where are we going again? Who
are you, anyway?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So...very...hot!
Anyone smell roasting Goomba?

Must...concentrate...
Many dangers in the desert...
Keep eyes open...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're going to get lost...
This desert seems endless.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Dry Dry Ruins.
Weren't you totally blown away
when it rose out of the sand?

That was awesome! I wish we 
could make it happen again!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dry Dry Desert never ends.
How big is it, anyway?
I'm beat. My feet hurt.

This sand feels like it's a
thousand degrees.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know what I just realized?
I hate the desert! Yup! 

Sand gets in my eyes so I can't
see. I feel like I've eaten a
couple pounds of sand, and my
feet itch.

I'm freaking out here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah, yes! Some more sand and
some more cacti!
How do you stand such a boring
landscape?

Look, when I signed on for this
adventure, I was under the
impression that there would be
no boredom involved.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's scorching, Mario!
I'm turning to charcoal!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I feel dazed... So thirsty...
The cacti seem to be moving...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know what? Traveling in the
desert is really hard.

Just moving my feet in the sand
is exhausting. I feel like I'm
stuck in quicksand. 
Are we even getting anywhere?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario!
Did you know that...

cacti save water inside?
That's the only way they can
survive out here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Does it ever rain in a desert
like this?
I seriously doubt it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If there's too little rain, the
cacti will dry up.
Did you know that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So blue...the desert sky...
They ought to call it...
"Big Ol' Super Blue Sky"!

I think I'm delirious. It's so
hot out here, I can't think
straight.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This looks almost exactly the
same as everywhere else.

Fine, so there're a few trees
growing here. Big deal! I still
hate this place!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's hot. The desert is hot.

I can't imagine that people would
actually choose to live in a place
like this.

Don't they get hot?
I guess some like it hot...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm spent, Mario.
No shade, no water, no nothing.
I hate this place. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All this blowing sand would cover
up most paths.
I don't even know which direction
we're moving.

If we find that big path again,
let's stick to it so we don't get
lost again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is there nothing here but sand,
rocks and cacti?

I guess we should be happy that
we're not in a sandstorm. I did
see a whirlwind, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario... I'm so tired...
If we find a shady tree, let's
take a rest for a while...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How do trees grow here?
When we find a big one, let's
take a rest for a while.

You wouldn't think that anything
could grow around here.
These must be a hardy type of
tree, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We should be near Dry Dry
Outpost.

Boy, after the endless sands of
this desert, it'll be nice to put
our feet up in a town for a while.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Kolorado is searching out
mysteries, as usual. He seems
to be looking for ruins here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here... I remember this spot.
It's where that explorer,
Kolorado, used to have his
base camp set up.

Do you think he found what he
was looking for?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
As long as we stick to the path,
it's easy to go from Mt. Rugged
to Dry Dry Outpost without
getting lost.

Since so many people use this
path, the desert sands can't
cover it up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Traveling through places like
this desert really makes you
appreciate water.

I'm pretty thirsty right now.
Aren't you, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In an area like this,
it's tough to find things that
can serve as landmarks.

But that rock in the shape of a
cactus is a pretty good one.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Just putting one foot in front
of another is hard here.
Whenever I take a break, I feel
like I don't want to move again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah, a couple of trees are
growing here. It might just be
my imagination, but the air feels
a bit cooler right here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Just east of here is the desert
town, Dry Dry Outpost.

We'd better remember how to get
back here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The desert is filled with bandits
who love to steal coins from
travelers.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
More rocks and sand! It'd be
really easy to get lost around
here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! There's a whole lot of
nothing around here.
Any idea which direction we
should take, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, it's smart to take a
nap when it gets too hot.

That reminds me of something my
mom used to say:
"Take a nap, will you!"
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look, it's unbearably hot out. I'm
getting pretty fed up with it, if
you want to know the truth...

Isn't there somewhere we can
stop for a rest? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at that rocky plateau.
It looks like it's too high to
climb, but I can almost see
something good up there...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look! Look, Mario!
There's actually some grass
growing around here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, there sure are a lot
of rocks in the desert.

Before I came here, I thought
there was just sand. But there
are rocks, too. Whoopee.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Cacti also have flowers, did you
know that?
I haven't seen any, though...

Do people eat cacti?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The desert wind constantly
builds up and tears down the
sand dunes.

They say it constantly changes,
but it pretty much looks the
same to me all the time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are big cacti around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario?
Are you thirsty at all?
I'm parched. Really thirsty.
Totally dried up.

Wait a minute...
My mouth is really dry! Maybe
that's why they call it Dry Dry
Desert!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look! Look, Mario!
There's actually some grass
growing around here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh...thank heavens!
At last, we've found an oasis!
It's not a mirage, is it?

The trees are so green! The
water, so blue! Hurray!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So hot...so very, very hot...
This desert trip...
I can't take it anymore!

Hey, Mario,
let's find some shade and relax
for a while, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If we get lost in the desert,
we'll dry up and turn into
mummies.

How about it? Let's rest by that
small rock.
Maybe there's something unusual
about that rock...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario, aren't you hungry? How
about thirsty? Tired?
I'm all of those things.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
W... Water...
Must have water...

I'm so thirsty I could bite a
cactus...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you think there are any other
mysteries in this desert besides
the ruins?

It'd be nice if we stumbled upon
some treasure or something.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
No matter where we go, all I see
is sand.
That's what this is like. A sea of
sand.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're lucky we have hats on.
We'd probably have come down
with sunstroke by now if we
hadn't had our hats.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Dry Dry Outpost.
Lots of Dryites and Nomadimice
live here.

I'm so happy to find civilization
after crossing that desert.

Despite the climate, lots of
travelers seem to come here.
Still, they can't get that many
tourists. It's too hot!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that this town was
originally founded by thieves
from the desert.

It's a pretty mysterious town,
don't you think?

There are all kinds of stories
and legends about this place.
The residents around here love
all those old tales.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's the entrance to Dry Dry
Ruins. It's called the illusion
ruin.

Nobody could find this place for
ages. But we did!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Legend has it that there are
many traps and puzzles in these
ruins.

When this was a great palace,
the keepers set all the traps
up to keep looters from stealing
their treasures.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Compared to the desert, it's
cool in here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's a great view of the
desert from the upstairs floor.

The farther down we go,
the cooler it'll get. It'll get
darker, too, though.
Should we go down there?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now that I've helped you find 
Dry Dry Ruins, will I become
famous, too?

You don't care. You're already
a household name.

Hmmph.
Hey, a picture of some Chomps.

Maybe there are Chomps
guarding these ruins.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a bit sandy, huh?
Well, when you're buried in the
desert, you pick up some sand.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's amazing that these ruins
still have moving parts.
Haven't they been buried here
for ages and ages?

And yet, when we push switches,
stuff moves...
Amazing craftsmanship. You've
gotta applaud the designers.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My mouth is so dry...
I feel like I ate dust.

I feel like my skin is cracking
off and my eyes are turning 
into sandpaper.

D'you have any moisturizer?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at these stairways!
How do they make 'em revolve?

Whoever built this place must
have been brilliant.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sure that ruins like these
are full of hidden rooms.

We should keep our eyes open for
anything suspicious.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at the Chomp statues!
Even though I know they're just
statues, they still scare me.

This seems to be the very center
of the ruins.

In case I haven't mentioned it
before, the architects of this
place were geniuses.

Moustafa's ancestors must have
been amazing people.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm pretty beat.

Phew... Well, heroes don't take
rests, I guess.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I feel hungry for some reason.
Did you hear that? My belly
is making sounds like a Chomp!

Boy, a cold drink and a hot
sandwich would taste good.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I knew this place would have
lots of hidden areas.

Ancient palaces always do!
It's like a law of ancient
architecture, I think.

And by the way, there's always
supposed to be treasure, too.
I wouldn't mind finding
something nice...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Tutankoopa's old lair.
That guy wasn't so tough.
You're much tougher, Mario.

I can't believe Tutankoopa was
the master here.

This kingdom was originally
built by Nomadimice, many
generations ago. 

I'll tell you, Tutankoopa didn't
look much like a Nomadimouse.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's pretty dark around here.
We'd better be careful not to
get lost or ambushed.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We'd better get ready for a
fight!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If we go east, we'll get to the
entrance of Forever Forest.
If we go west, we'll hit Toad
Town. Remember?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy... This forest is really dark
and spooky.

People say that if you don't
choose exactly the right paths,
you'll get totally lost.

I can believe it. This looks like
the type of place where you get
lost and then monsters come out
of the grass and...

Hey!
Did you notice that grass over
there rustling? I swear I saw
it move!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario...
Don't look now, but I think I
saw an eye shining deep inside
the hole in that tree. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The flowers in this forest are
unusual, huh?
They're strangely colored, and
they look creepy when they move.

I think I saw some that were a
slightly different color over
there.
Did you see 'em?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The trees in this forest are
weird, aren't they?
I've heard sometimes they smile
wickedly...

I'll tell you, if I see a tree
smiling, I'm gonna run in the
opposite direction!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is it just my imagination or is
it getting darker?
Are we going the right way?
I'm getting a little worried.

There seem to be a lot of
strange glowing mushrooms
around these tree trunks.

Boy! They're everywhere!
Must be an infestation...

It kind of looks like one
mushroom patch is slightly
different from the others.

My mind may just be playing
tricks on me, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What kind of evil flowers would
grow in a place like this?
When we approach, some seem to
shrink, while others just grin...

But...but I'm not scared.
I mean it, Mario!
I told you that they don't scare
me! All right?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Where are we?

After making so many turns on
different paths, I'm getting
confused as to which way is up.
Aren't there any signs? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look, I'm sick of this forest, all
right? Let's get out of here.

I don't care how many important
things are hidden in this forest,
I can't spend another instant in
the freaky place!

Look, I know I saw a beehive.
Let's make the beehive a
landmark. OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This all looks the same to me.
Gloomy trees that seem to go on
forever. Seems like they found
the perfect name for this place.

By the way, did you hear
something in that bush?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Boo's Mansion.

Great name for a haunted house,
don't you think?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the back gate to Boo's
Mansion.

As far as I can tell, this is
the edge of Gusty Gulch. Tubba
Blubba's Castle is up on the hill.

It's amazing how the scenery
changes from forest to gulch
so quickly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a magnificent mansion!
Being haunted must hurt the
real estate value, though...

I like the old-fashioned yet
eerie style.

The chandelier and the display
case look like they're valuable
antiques.

Even the sofa in the foyer looks
like it's pricey, even though
it's a bit worn.

I love antiques.
I wouldn't mind taking a good
look at those things.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The blue light is spooky in here,
but you can tell that this room
is really nice.

It feels like something is
watching us.

It feels like that everywhere.
It's almost as if this haunted
mansion is...haunted.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A storage room... isn't it?
You'd think those candles
would provide a bit more light.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Another storage room, I guess.
Not a whole lot here, as far as
I can tell.

Hey, incidentally,
what happened to the door...? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This room does have a lot of
space, but it's still a shame
to use it for storage.

That pot and those wooden
boxes look suspicious...

There's also a weakened spot
on the floor.
Look...under the chandelier.

Hey, check it out!
A real old rocking chair!
These things rule! 

It rocks back and forth when
you sit on it. I love napping
in these.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There certainly seem to be a
lot of books.
I didn't know Boos liked books.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, that strange contraption
at the back of the room is a
phonograph.

You know, a machine for
listening to records.

Have you seen any records
around here?

I wouldn't mind doing a little
adventuring to the timeless
classic, "Mario's Theme"!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow!
What a gorgeous chandelier!
If they actually cleaned it,
it would brighten this place up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the highest room in the
mansion.

I'm guessing it's Bow's room.
She seems like the type to live
in a huge room.

When you look at this room, it's
pretty obvious that Bow was
raised by a really wealthy family
of Boos.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's a windmill.

Those vanes are turning really
slowly.
The sound of it turning is sort
of lonely...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody told me if a house is
dilapidated, it means it's
crumbly and deserted.
That sounds like this place.

Goompa said Boos love this sort
of place.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The way that house leans is
bizarre, isn't it?

Why do Boos like homes like
these?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Gusty Gulch.
Watch your step on the rocky
slopes.

You also have to beware of
strange creatures.
My dad would say that going
through here builds character...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Gusty Gulch.
It looks like there's a gap over
there that won't be easy to
cross. You'll need some help.

Let's be quick but careful. I
don't like the looks of the
creatures around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We've reached the top of
Gusty Gulch.
That building is Tubba Blubba's
Castle, isn't it?

The land here is totally barren.
Was it always like this?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a huge hall!
Looks like it's crumbling, though.

Boy, if this main hall collapses,
the entire castle will follow.
This whole place looks like it's
falling apart.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a corridor.

I'm sure it was really 
magnificent before Tubba
Blubba let it get filthy.

You can barely see the beauty
beneath the dirt.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! This room is huge!
I guess Tubba Blubba's pretty
big, though, so it's probably
just the right size.

High ceilings really make a
room feel luxurious.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There're the stairs.
Even the staircases are big.
This place is monstrous. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There're the stairs.
Ugh! A cobweb!

I just can't stand creatures
that don't tidy up...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a basement, isn't it?
Yup...
and a big one, too. This makes
a great hiding place.

I don't think Clubbas patrol
down here, so it's probably 
safe to rest for a while.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh! The dining room set here
is fantastic!

If they got curtains that
weren't so old, they could
really bring the room together.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This castle's too big...
I'm so tired.
All we ever do is walk...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, even the huge cracks
in the walls don't bother me
that much.

But spiderwebs? C'mon, a little
housecleaning, people!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You think Tubba Blubba likes this
castle?

If he did, you'd think he could
spend a little time fixing it up.
I mean, an occasional cleaning...

What a waste.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Filthy as it is, this castle has
surprisingly little dust.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa!
Spikes in the floor!
Don't try to jump over 'em!
There are too many!

How can we get through without
being hurt by the spikes?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, here we go! A chair tipped
over, a drawer left open...
Doesn't anyone ever clean 
around here?

While we're here, though, let's
take a closer look at that
drawer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ugh...more stairs...
Up and down, up and down...
Will it never end?

It's just a little tiring,
that's all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We've been in here a while.

I wouldn't mind having a house
this huge. Of course, it's kind
of a pain to have to walk so far
between rooms.

We could get an awesome game of
hide and seek going in here, but
I guess kids might get lost
pretty easily.

Well...
I wouldn't get lost, of course.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What is this, a Clubba nap room?
If we don't disturb 'em, maybe
they won't wake up. 

But sshh...
We must go slow and be quiet...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is only a corridor but it's
as big as an ordinary room.
Is that necessary?

This area alone might be bigger
than my entire house.
That makes me mad for some
reason.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey look! A table, a bed,
a chest and a drawer.

This is the only tasteful room
in the place! Everything is so
elegantly coordinated.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I haven't been in many windmills,
but this one seems weird.
Isn't this a well sitting in the
middle of it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I guess the well's dry.
Lucky for us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can tell from the dampness
that there used to be water in
this well.

The rocks are also moist to the
touch.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You wouldn't expect there to be
such a nice walkway in a place
like this.

It's so neat. It doesn't look
like it's a natural path.
Somebody must take care of it...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Something important has just got
to be back here. Nobody would
dig such a long tunnel for
nothing...

What do you think it could
possibly be, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the very end of the
tunnel in the well.
It seems to be a big dead end.

This really is the perfect spot
for hiding something really
valuable.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This seems to be a playroom for
Shy Guys.

They don't have to answer to
anybody down here.
I envy these guys...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! Just like a real toy box.
Look! There are building blocks 
lying around everywhere.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Say...are we actually inside the
Toy Box right now?

How could all this be inside that
little box? Best not to think
about it too much...

Looks like this is Blue Station.
It's a train station.

I think if we use that jump pad
we can go back to Toad Town
whenever we want.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at all the doodles on the
walls!
Did Shy Guys draw all these?

They're kind of cute.
I didn't know that Shy Guys had
a cute side.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look! There are moving panels
on the walls and even a railroad
crossing.
What a fun room!

I wish I could play here!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Pink Station! Pink Station!
There's the switch to
change the tracks.

I have to admit, this Toy Box is
a pretty cool place.

If I told Goombaria about this,
I'm sure she would be so jealous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Over, around, up and back...
It's like a maze in here.
Still, since we're inside a Toy
Box, I'm enjoying myself.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, it's Green Station!
This train takes us to all the
stations.

Boy, if we could go anywhere by
just pushing a button, traveling
would be a dream, don't you
think?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody told me...
Bow can easily avoid all kinds
of enemy attacks.

What a cool skill!
I wish I had that kind of useful
talent.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Red Station.
First Blue, then Pink, then Green
and finally Red.

It's a pretty cute touch, naming
stations after colors.

By the looks of this place, I'd
say that Shy Guys like cuteness.
They even look like cute kids!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The walls here are made of
gigantic colored blocks.
Luckily, there also seem to be
several elevators.

What do you think we'll see if
we ride them?
I say we find out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Uh... I do believe it's dark.
Isn't there a light switch in this
place?
I can't see anything at all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder who made this Toy Box.
I assume Shy Guys made it.

They have such cool toys... I wish
I could befriend 'em, but I guess
they're too mischievous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's really dark in here.
I can't see a thing.

I feel like somebody could be
right next to me and I wouldn't
even know it. Yikes!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is quite an open space.
It kind of resembles a toy
arena, don't you think?

Remember those Shy Guys we
fought here? They were tough.

Of course,
they weren't as tough as us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The walls here are so fancy and
fun to look at.
What a cool place!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This whale's tongue is squishy.
It makes it hard to walk.
It's also kind of dark...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's completely dark. I can't
see a thing,
Mario! What's up ahead?

You know, being inside a whale
belly is gross...
Damp... Squishy...
Let's never do this again.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is where the whale comes
and goes!
Riding the whale sure was fun!

This is where all travelers
first set foot on the beach of
Lavalava Island.

Beautiful water... Deep, lush
jungles... A huge volcano...
There's something for everyone!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These beaches seem to go on
forever, don't they?

I've never seen some of these
flowers. They're sure pretty!
I should look for some shells
if we have time later.

I'm going to take flowers and
shells back to Goombaria.
She'll be happy...and she'll
also be jealous. Ha ha ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yoshis seem to love the beach.
Just looking at those guys
basking in the sun makes me
feel very relaxed.

And yet, even though I'd love
to just sleep on the beach, I'm
excited to move on.

Nothing compares to adventure,
that's for sure!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's a real tropical resort
atmosphere here, isn't there?

There's a nice Toad House with
beach access, and you can go to
the volcano or Jade Jungle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The entrance to the volcano is
very near here.

A green jungle, a massive
volcano and red-hot, flowing
lava. What a view!

It probably wouldn't look so
good if the lava were coming
toward us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Sometimes crossing bridges is
the only way to reach certain
islands.

It seems like a pain, but what
are you gonna do?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is where we saved Sushie
when she was caught up in that
tree.

Waa ha ha ha...

I just can't help laughing when
I remember that!
Please don't tell her I laughed
about it, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I thought jungles were supposed
to be all trees, but this one's
full of water.
Are all jungles like this?

It looks like we can't reach the
other shore from here.
We'll have to find another way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can't imagine what those Yoshi
kids were thinking...
...playing in a place like this...
I'm not surprised, though.

Kids! Always up to something!
Besides, it's natural to want
to go on an adventure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're in Jade Jungle.
Quite a lot of water, huh?

Since there's no bridge,
we'll have to find another way
to get around.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That rotating flower down by
that ledge? Locals call it a
Spinning Flower.

If you spin around on top of
that flower, I hear that you can
float upward.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
For a jungle, there sure aren't
many trees around.

It gets brutally hot here
whenever the sun shines directly
on me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My, it's bright here!
This must be on the outskirts of
the jungle, huh?

Incidentally, I have no idea
how those Yoshi kids could come
this deep into the jungle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's a big Raven's statue.

You gotta figure... A big statue
this deep in the jungle...
I bet it's important.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I bet only jungle explorers know
about this hidden underground
chamber.

It's so dark in here I can't see
a thing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ooh...it's darker in here.
The trees are much thicker and
that bizarre ivy seems to be
growing everywhere.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What cool little fountains!
Must be an underground spring.

If we push these blocks over the
holes to seal 'em, what'll happen
to the water?

Do you think it'll come out from
another hole?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Looks like some of the ivy is
hanging off the trees here.
I wonder what would happen if
you pulled on it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What part of Jade Jungle are
we in?
I'm thinking we're deep in the
inner jungle.

I think I hear something.
From just ahead, I can almost
hear mysterious voices...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a huge tree!
This definitely must be the
biggest tree in Jade Jungle.

How old must it be?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's so spacious in here!
I can't believe we're inside a
tree right now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! We're way up high!
The jungle floor looks so tiny
from here! 

Gulp! Have I mentioned before
that I hate heights?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can't get over how huge the
inside of this tree is! It's
enormous! It's mammoth!

And another thing, it's giant!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This appears to be the nest of
Raphael the Raven.
He's the guardian of Jade
Jungle.

This nest is really sturdy. It
won't budge, even if Raphael
jumps up and down on the
branch.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is definitely the entrance
to the volcano.
What do you say we explore
deeper inside?

The scenery around here is
unlike anything I've ever seen.
I wish we had time to inspect it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now that...is a lot of lava.
Did you know it'd be this hot?
And we have to cross here, don't
we? I knew it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a big cavern.
I've heard that some volcanoes
have caverns that go down for
miles and miles!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These Fire Bars are a huge pain,
aren't they, Mario?
We can get by 'em. Don't worry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a steep slope.
We have to press on, but I'm 
getting a little tired going over
over such rough road.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, if it weren't for that
lava, it'd be dark in here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, this lava is everywhere!
How are we gonna cross it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, we're real spelunkers,
aren't we? My Goompa told me
that means cave-explorer.
Kind of like Kolorado!

I wonder how he manages,
exploring all by himself?
At least we have each other.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a pit if I ever saw one.
It's a big one, too. If we're not
careful, we could get lost. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a really steep slope.
If we dropped something here,
gravity would make it roll down.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's like a sea filled with lava.

Welcome to the Lava Sea!

Wanna swim? I'm just joking, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We need to go east from here.
It's a good thing that it's just
light enough to see. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This cavern is lit by the lava
below, so the upper level is
slightly darker.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lava has filled in the floor down
there, so we can't go back down.

Too bad! Well, I guess we should
be moving on--with any luck to 
someplace a lot cooler!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's hot, hot, scorching hot!

It's like being slowly cooked
from the bottom up!
In hot grease! On a hot day!
I can't take it anymore!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This place is shaking itself to
pieces! This is not good!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The lava's overflowing...
We're never gonna make it!
What are we gonna do??
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the portal between the
flower garden in Toad Town and
Flower Fields. 

The Wise Wisterwood, who's the
elder of this fair land, watches
over the area.
Talk about a big tree!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Petunia makes her home here.

But I didn't know that Monty
Moles did, as well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What crystal-clear water!
Just looking at it refreshes me!
I feel like a new Goomba!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I guess they couldn't call it
Flower Fields without flowers.
Me, I'd rather have some tasty
fruit than pretty flowers.

As short as I am, when we walk
through flowers, I can't see
a thing! And I have allergies!
It's not a whole lot of fun.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's another platform up
there, but I don't think we can
get up there.

I hate these flower patches!
They totally cover me!

Those three trees seem to be
important to me. If we hit 'em
right, something might drop.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like there hasn't been
water here in a while.

And there's just one flower.
How very sad.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lily looks happy in her
replenished spring, huh?
It's so much more beautiful here
when there's water flowing.

Do you think this water flows to
all parts of Flower Fields?

I've heard that this water is
absolutely bursting with healthy
nutrients.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a hedge maze.

I hope we don't get lost. I'm not
very good at mazes. Still, I know
you'll get us through all right.
You're Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh, I love rose gardens!
Roses are just the best.
Although they do have thorns,
don't they?

All of the most beautiful flowers
have thorns. At least that's
what they say.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This area is full of flowers.
Red flowers, blue flowers,
yellow flowers...even orange
flowers are blooming.

It looks like there are a lot of
Lakitus in bloom, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look, a flower blowing lots of
bubbles!
Will wonders never cease?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the Sun Tower.

This is where the sun comes to
rest.
Do you think it's waiting here or
being forced to stay?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Green, purple and red...
the platforms are all different
colors.

If you jump on them hard, they'll
move up and down.
We need to figure out the right
order to move them in.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There are flower patches
bordering this path.

It looks peaceful, but there are
lots of briar patches and
enemies around, so be careful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What happened to the wall here?
It looks like it collapsed.
This place seems very different
from the rest of Flower Fields.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Wow! We're in the clouds!
We're floating!. It feels comfy,
but I just don't quite trust it.
Mario,

am I sinking? Am I?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're way up in the air.
Since we're on a cloud, we must
be close to Star Haven.

Do you think the Star Spirits
are OK?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A tree's been cut down here.
And there's a well. Do you think
we can get water from there?

You never know, something might
be living in there...
What if something weird jumps
out at us? Well, it could!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at all the flowers.
Even the flowers blooming along
the road are beautiful here in
Flower Fields.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, if you like flowers, this is
the place to be. Look at all the
foliage!

Hey, by the way, blue trees
produce Bubble Berries.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Since it's called Flower Fields,
you know there have to be lots
of flowers around here.
But there are also a few trees.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard from Goompa that Shiver
City is covered with snow all
year round.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Shiver City.
It's usually completely covered
with snow and ice.

It's perfect for penguins.
It's a bit cold for me.
You seem to be fine, though.
How do you do it, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like we could go skating
on that frozen pond.

Skating is tons of fun!
I don't know, though... Do you
think that ice might break?

Oh, you might also notice that
gate over there. It leads out
into the highlands.

The path from that gate leads
all the way to Starborn Valley.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's too bad we broke the ice in 
that pond, huh? Now we can't go
skating!
What a pity!

That gate is the way between
the village and the cold hills
beyond. A guard is always
stationed there.

If you follow the path from that
gate, eventually you'll come to
Starborn Valley.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This path is pretty clear of
snow, don't you think?

Do you think people clear it off,
or does the snow just melt?
Bit of a mystery,
eh, Mario?

I wonder if the good citizens
of Shiver City have an answer
for it...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at all those snowmen
standing in a line.

I wonder who made them...
And why. They kind of look like
they're watching the path.

They look pretty cold, too...
but I guess snowmen like cold.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think we're still on the path,
but it feels more wild here.

If we travel east from here,
we'll hit Starborn Valley.
Shiver City is way off to the
west.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Starborn Valley.
Merle makes his home here, along
with Ninjis and Toads.

They look after Star Kids until
they go up to the sky.
It must be a hard work.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Shiver Mountain.

This is a very cold, dangerous
climb.
Be careful. OK, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I feel like we're on the edge of
the world up here.

Seriously! This is a really
remote place to go adventuring!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, climbing this mountain is
really hard!

You'd think the path to a palace
dedicated to the Stars would be
a lot less trying on the legs.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Walk carefully up here or else
you may slip, Mario.

That would be a long, long way
down, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What a strange place this is!
It's bright even in the cave...

This must be the small cave that
Merle told us about.

There's something strange about
this place...
Even the walls seem suspicious
to me for some reason.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the door to the Crystal
Palace.
We can get in from here.

It must've been tough to get
building materials up here!

Don't you think it would've 
been more convenient if they
had built it at a lower
elevation?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So spacious!
You gotta love the high ceilings,
huh, Mario?

You could set up a basketball
court in here!
The rich really know how to live!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This room is pretty cramped.
I wonder what it was used for.
Servants quarters, maybe?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is this like a waiting room?
I don't know how people could
deal with so many rooms. It's
totally confusing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Even though we're indoors, it's
still freezing in here!
I mean, seriously, the floor's
frozen... I hate it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy, these rooms all seem to look
alike, huh?

It seems symmetrical. You know,
the left side is a mirror image
of the right side.

It'll be really easy to get lost
in here.
Continue with care. OK, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a long corridor, huh?

Even the wallpaper around here
looks frozen.
Although I do very much like the
star pattern.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a long corridor, huh?
Hey! That's our reflection in the
floor! It's like a mirror!

This place almost makes me miss
the desert. I'm freezing!
How can you stand it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario,
have you noticed our reflection
on the floor?

I don't trust a floor this shiny.
I bet it's slippery.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Talk about cold! My knees are
knocking! My teeth are
chattering!

Don't you have any problems
at all, Mario?
Let's keep moving so I don't 
freeze into a Goombsicle.

I've had all I can stand...
...must leave this fridge...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like your basic passage.
Since we're in a palace, I'll call
it a palatial passage. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Strange... The reflected room
looks slightly different...
Funny, huh...

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah-ha! It's a cave, isn't it?

It's nice to get a breath of
fresh air, but I must say that
it's even colder out here than
in there. Unbelievable!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The architecture of this place
is really bizarre.

We pass back and forth through
these glass walls...
Not knowing what's a mirror and
what's not really bugs me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
An indoor bridge? Now I've seen
everything!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The official line on this palace
is that it's temporarily closed
because of the snow and ice.

Do you think Kolorado would
research this place?

I wonder if he's already planning
a trip here...
Maybe he's never heard of the
palace at all.

Or maybe he just has no clue how
to get up here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's easy to believe that this
place was originally built as
a palace to honor the Stars of
the sky.

Merle said that, didn't he?
It's terrible that people have
forgotten it and don't come
here anymore. What a waste.

Maybe after we clear it, the
tourist trade will start anew.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's one big stone statue.
Even you couldn't budge a
statue that massive, Mario. 

If it were just a bit smaller,
we could probably push it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's a mysterious stone
statue.

This palace seems to have
cornered the market on
mysterious stone statues, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The blue decorating scheme
makes this place feel so cold.

Some warm tones would help.
...So...very...cold...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think my body temperature has
dropped about ten degrees since
we've been here.

I should've kept that scarf we
gave to the snowman.

Mario, you don't look cold.
Is it just because I'm a Goomba
or because you're a fine-tuned
adventuring machine?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hey, Mario!
You can reach far-off objects
by jumping and kicking Kooper's
shell, isn't that right?

So he can activate switches that
are across wide gaps or even in
reflections, right?
I wish I could do that, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those Albino Dinos...
They seem to turn and face us
when we talk to 'em.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Hmm...a back door.
You think it's going to be a
dead end up ahead? 

Hey, by the way...
What do you think the Star
Spirits are up to right now?

I was just thinking of 'em.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I thought you already knew that
you could activate switches by
giving them some sort of shock.

You can use Kooper or Bombette
to do it, you know.
Don't forget!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Well, I've determined that
there's nothing here but cold,
and I don't like it at all!!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All the rooms look alike around
here.
Did they design this area to
intentionally confuse us?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder how far we've gone.
I really can't say enough
good things about the star
decorations here.

I mean it.
It's such a pity that people
don't visit here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Brrr...
It's so cold. This cold is gonna
give me a cold...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I never trust polished floors
because they're often slippery.
I really don't want to fall and
bump my head.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
My reflection is weird.
Seeing myself in the floor is
starting to freak me out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like we can take a
break here, doesn't it?
If only we had some hot cocoa,
we could take a real rest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Bowser's Castle.
This appears to be the hangar
for Bowser's vehicles.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Boy! Bowser's Castle.
Talk about your basic eerie
atmosphere, huh? 

Oh... I'm nervous and excited at
the same time.
We're heading for the final fight
at last!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Are we still outside the castle
or what?
Let's hurry through here.
OK, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I've gotta hand it to him.
Bowser's Castle is amazing!
Such creative use of lava flows!
It's just like that volcano!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a covered hallway in
Bowser's Castle.

It doesn't look like anything's
amiss in here.
Let's press on, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These stairs aren't lighted
very well, are they?
I wonder how deep below ground
they go.

Bowser should really look into
some ambient lighting.  
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a prison cell where
Toads are being held.

You know... There are Toads
here...and beds...
It's kind of like a Toad House!

Do you think that I'm just an
incurable optimist? Well, what's
wrong with that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a covered hallway.
I can sum up the decorations in
two words: pure Bowser!

Such dark colors and drab
lighting! What terrible taste!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at the size of that stone
Bowser face!
He's pretty scary looking.

That face gives me the creeps,
Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's an underground prison cell,
Mario.

Are you sure you can find the
way back to where we were
before?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I wonder where all this lava
comes from?
Don't you think it's odd?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The lava seems to have hardened
as it cooled off.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Lava, lava, lava!  There's such
a thing as too much lava,
that's for sure.

Mario, are you all right in this
heat?

Boy, it's hot!
This adventure has just been
one extreme or the other.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, walking on newly
hardened lava is not exactly
something that your average
Goomba gets to experience.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The only way to cross the lava  
is to have somebody carry us.

If we could find a way to cool
the lava off, we could probably
walk on it, though.

And if we have to pass through
lava flows, we can have Bow hide
us from danger.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Now we're cooking! I mean, now
we're not cooking!
It's still hot, but not, you know,
burning hot.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's a treasure chest.
Things are looking up. The lava
has even cooled. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's the source of the lava.
It's miserably hot when it's
flowing.

It's not so bad when it's cooled
off, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems to be a cave.
Are we below the castle?
It's so dark.

They must have had problems
setting up lights down here.
What a pain for us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems to be a cave.
Are we below the castle?
It's so dark.

How long can this darkness
possibly last? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Ah! We're back inside Bowser's
Castle.

There's a stone pedestal with
Bowser's face carved on it.

What poor taste!
What an egomaniac!
If we push that thing, what do
you think will happen?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a hall in Bowser's Castle.

I wonder where it leads.
We have to hurry! And yet, we
should also be careful.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Here's the storage room for
Bowser's Castle.
It looks like one of his subjects
is selling his stuff. Ha ha!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We're somewhere inside Bowser's
Castle.
This hall is quite large.

It also looks well fortified.
I wonder if there's anything
good around here?
An attack item, maybe?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I'm sure Bowser's going to be
surprised.
I'm sure he'd never believe that
we could make it this far.

I can't wait to see the
expression on his face.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If Bombette were about three
times bigger, we could just blow
all these walls up.

It would certainly let us move
through these areas a lot
faster.

But that's probably not a good
idea.
It would be far too dangerous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This room is one big ego massage
for Bowser.
I wish we could crush all these
statues to dust.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a covered hallway in
Bowser's Castle.
There's no place to hide around
here, that's for sure.

Not that we need one, Mario!
Who'd hide? Not me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Do you think those windows open
to outside or to the inner part
of the castle?

I'm getting totally turned
around in here. This castle
really is huge.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a room without a window.
It also has a chandelier with no
lights in it.

I'm getting the feeling that
Bowser is really going for the
dark, gothic look in here. 

Maybe he hates bright lights.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
All the torches hanging over
there... Doesn't their pattern
strike you as sort of
suspicious?

It's almost as if there's a
hidden meaning there.
What do you say we try to
remember it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think we keep passing through
the same room.
Do you think, perhaps, that
somebody's messing with us?

Well, it's a waste of time to
just keep running around with
no clue about what we're doing.

It's kind of like what happened
in Forever Forest.
Say...those torches might hold
a clue for us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Again with the Bowser faces!
I'm sick of looking at his ugly
mug!

Let's find the real Bowser and
show him who's boss!

And then I can meet Princess
Peach! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the outside of Bowser's
Castle.
Even the outside feels gross
and ominous.

Maybe he wasn't so bad until he
moved here. Living in a such a
dank place isn't good for the
soul.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
How many halls have we been
through?
I wonder what this one leads
to...

To Bowser's room? Maybe?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Know what this reminds me of?
A ghost story! This would make
the perfect setting for a
freaky ghost story!

We could have Bow and her
friends play the scary parts.
Remind me to do that some time
back at Toad Town!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a prison cell within Bowser's
Castle.
A lot of Toads are here.

It's a bit strange...
Why would Bowser ever need this
many prison cells?

Do you think there are that many
prisoners?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think we've already come
really far. 
But we're not at Bowser's
room yet. Where could it be?

This place is so complicated!
That Bowser...
I really don't like him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
"I smell treasure!"
Isn't that a good Kolorado
imitation? Mario? Wasn't that
right on?

I wonder what Kolorado's doing?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a corridor of sorts. I
guess it's more like an elevated
skyway, though.

If a guy were afraid of heights,
his legs would probably tremble
and he'd probably freak out.
Gulp!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, if I were designing
a castle, I wouldn't put in so
many corridors.

Well, whatever. You can't expect
Bowser to have good taste.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at all these carvings of
Bowser's ugly mug! It's really
shameless!
I guess he thinks he's cool.

Hey, incidentally, about those
stone pedestals...
Some move and some don't, so
check 'em all out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whoa! This corridor has much
lower ceilings, huh?
I guess I had gotten used to
really high ceilings.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In case you don't know by now,
some of these Bowser pedestals
can be pushed and others can't.

In many cases, you can push
them from either the right
or left sides.
I wonder where I heard that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a hidden passage.
It's a bit dark, huh?
That's all right. I can sense
that something good's in here.♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Some of these Bowser pedestals
can be pushed and others can't.

In many cases, you can push
them from either the right
or left sides.

If they move, you can be sure
they're covering a hidden
passage.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
See! A hidden passage.
This one doesn't seem to be
hiding anything interesting.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
...Nothing.
This room's just a dead end.
How worthless.

Let's go back to the room where
the pedestals are and check 'em
out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This hidden passage looks
promising, doesn't it? It
must lead somewhere...

You know, I hope we're going the
right direction. I feel kind of
disoriented.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
We've certainly seen many kinds
of treasure on our adventures,
haven't we, Mario?

There's one that I would value
above all others, though.

I would keep it in the safest
place I know...
Mario, please give me your
autograph!!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Stairs again!
Do you think Princess Peach's 
Castle is at the top of 'em?

We're almost there, Mario! I can
feel it! Onward! The princess
awaits!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the archaeologist, Kolorado.
He's famous as both a scholar
and an explorer.

Unfortunately, he's also
renowned for his carelessness.

He's wild about treasures and
ancient secrets, so he's always
taking off around the world on
some adventure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Koopa Troopa from the
excavation team.
The team is assisting Kolorado.

That looks like hard work.
Doing chores in this heat? Ugh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's Chuck Quizmo. He tries to
quiz anybody who speaks to him.

He pops up in various towns and
villages, but that doesn't mean
he's easy to find.

What do you think his deal is?

Personally, I'm a little more
interested in his assistant.
She's cute!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is one of the castle
maids.

Seeing as the castle has up and
disappeared, I guess they've
decided to take a holiday.

Traveling does have a way of
refreshing the body and mind.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is one of the castle
maids.
They're all traveling together.

They're quite good friends.
I've never seen 'em apart!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is one of the castle
maids.
She's always been very curious.

I wonder what kind of trip
they're taking.

It's definitely not going to be
as difficult as our journey, but
I'm kind of curious.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's Jr. Troopa. He used to
boot us out of the forest near
Goomba Village. He thinks he's
pretty tough.

As far as I can tell, he goes
around picking fights with people
who are stronger than he is.
Talk about dumb!

His hobbies are working out and
ordering stuff by mail.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's the Toad who hands out 
prizes at the radio Trading
Event.

If you take the item mentioned
on the radio, he'll hook you up
with a rare item.

You really should participate in
the Trading Event, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's a gorgeous lady named
Merluvlee. I can't believe I'm in
the same room with her!

She foresees events and uses
her magic powers to find what
you're looking for.
She's very accurate.

I think I'm in love... She's
incredible!
Pinch me, will you, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's Merlow.
He's about the same age as
I am.

I wanna play with him when we
finish our adventure.

I guess he trades Star Pieces
for Badges.

Merluvlee, who's downstairs, is
his sister. He's so lucky!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's an old Star Spirit.
His name is Eldstar.
He reminds me of my grandpa.

He's a revered person who lives
in Star Haven, way up beyond
the sky.
Uh...a revered star, I mean.

I wonder why he's here.
He should be in Star Haven.

And why does he look so... dim?
I can see right through him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's the Star Spirit, Misstar.
She was imprisoned by Bowser in
Mt. Lavalava.

Her life must've been really
tough recently.

But she still looks pretty.

♥ ♥ ♥

Boy, she makes me see stars!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad.
He never fails to go for a walk,
even if it's nasty out.

He also loves cleaning for some
reason. He cleans like crazy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a merchant by the name of
Rip Cheato.
Who knows why he set up here...

I guess it doesn't matter.
People can sell stuff wherever
they want. It's their choice. 

I actually kind of like it here.
It's like a secret fort!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's Russ T. Everyone says he's
the smartest Toad around.
He's always happy to share his
vast knowledge with people.

He's filled me in on things plenty
of times.

He knows a lot of things I can
only guess at. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's The Master of the Dojo.
He's been training students at
the Dojo for years.

My grandpa told me he's
incredibly strong.
He doesn't look like it, though.

I think he just got back from a
long journey where he trained
with fighters stronger than
he is. What dedication!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's Chan. He's one of the
trainees who seem to always be
at the Dojo.
He worships The Master.

I mean, it's all well and good
for Chan to admire The Master,
but I prefer Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the trainees who's 
always at the Dojo. His name is
Lee.

He's like an older brother to
Chan.

Lee respects The Master above
all else and hangs on every word
he says.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Toad runs this shop.
He buys, sells and checks items.

If you don't manage what you're
carrying well, you may not be 
able to hold everything.
Check items when you can.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is always standing in
front of the gate.
Is it his job, maybe?

He looks as if he's asleep on his
feet, but he actually knows quite
a bit about the town.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad always stands in front
of the shop.
He knows all about items.

He never moves, as far as I can
tell. Maybe he's trying to get a
tan.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is always very excited
about whatever news he has.
He's a little crazy.

Even so, it's a good idea to
listen to him.
He may be a little excitable, but
he always has news.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad claims that he and his
girl are in love.

But just the other day, he told
me he liked a different girl!
What a cad!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Those Toads are in love.
They're so in love, they don't
even notice what's going on.

Unless you like seeing public
displays of affection, I wouldn't
talk to them.
They're shameless. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She is the oldest of these three
Toad sisters. Apparently they
call themselves the 
"Three Beautiful Sisters."

I personally don't think they're
that attractive, but I guess for
Toads, they are.

Goombas and Toads think about
beauty in different ways, I
guess.
What do you think, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She is the second oldest of
these three Toad sisters.
Apparently they call themselves
the "Three Beautiful Sisters."

She obviously works pretty hard
with makeup to look gorgeous.

I guess... kind of cute... 
What do you think, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She is the youngest of these
three Toad sisters. Apparently
they call themselves the "Three
Beautiful Sisters."

She says she's cute.
I definitely think she's the
cutest of the three.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He doesn't seem to have any 
particular reason to be at the
Dojo. He's not fighting.

He just loiters around, checking
out the fighters.

Maybe he just likes watching
tough guys.
I bet he'll cheer for us if we
challenge The Master.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This family man ordinarily works
at Peach's Castle.

He was on his day off when the
castle disappeared.
Talk about your basic lucky 
coincidence! Wow!

He's a very reliable worker at
the castle...
but he never does chores around
the house.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's the homemaker here. She's
ordinarily very relaxed and
easygoing.

Since her lazy husband is home,
she's working harder than ever
right now.

The housework piles up every
day, but somehow she manages
it all with no help.
Where does she get the energy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the Toad kids.
He likes his father so much
that he always tries to sneak
into the castle.

He's about the same age as
I am.
We sometimes play together when
I come to Toad Town.

I guess he's a pretty good
friend of mine.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad kid who wants to be
really powerful.
He thinks that having power
solves everything.

His way of thinking is a little
bit different from mine.
He's a good enough guy, though,
when we play together.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad has tried his skills
at the Dojo.

That takes guts...
Someday I'm gonna try it all by
myself.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a stubborn and mysterious
old man.
His name is Merlon.

He uses magical powers to look
into the future.

I've listened to his stories
before and they're really long. I
try to pay attention but...
sometimes I fall asleep.

Still, his fortune-telling is
supposedly right on.
I don't know personally, but my
Goompa told me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Paratroopa looks extremely
serious.
And stubborn. And hardheaded.

If you have a letter coming,
he'll give it to you.
I wonder if he has one for me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
His name is Parakarry. He's a
Paratroopa who works for the
post office.

He's well known for being the
slowest mailman around.
A slow mailman? That can't be
good.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This guy's pretty funky.
His name is Rowf.
He sells Badges.

He travels all over the world,
buying and selling things.
I'm a little jealous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Rhuff. He's Rowf's kid.
He looks just like Rowf, right?

He's supposed to be helping, but
it looks like he's a pain...
Hmmm, well, it's Rowf's problem.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She takes care of flowers. Her
name is Minh T.
Nobody can match her skill at
growing flowers.

She must have a green thumb.
Flowers feel Minh T.'s love and
show it in their blooms.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a funny color for a Toad.
I've never seen him before.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a funny color for a Toad.
He reminds me of someone,
though... But who?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a funny color for a Toad.
You know, I don't think I want to
know this guy. He looks like bad
news.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a funny color for a Toad.
He looks...a little off.
He's trying to be cool, but he's
failing big time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This friendly Toad loves to run
his mouth.
He's a bit of a gossip.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This guy knows tons of gossip.
His favorite subject is the
brother and sister who live on
Shooting Star Summit.

Sometimes it's tough dragging
information out of him.
But then again, sometimes it's
worth it if you're curious.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad...
I'll tell you a secret. He's a
huge fan of the princess.

He told me once that he has a
big collection of her photos.
What a lovesick fool...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This guy often knows rumors.
He's counting on you, Mario.

You won't let him down, will you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It seems like this Toad is always
in love with someone.
Right now, he likes Minh T.

I think he's in good spirits.
As long as he can be near her,
he'll be happy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad who often thinks
about going south.
Maybe his girlfriend's there.

Or maybe he just has a lot of
friends from that area.
He's pretty chatty.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the manager of a Toad
House.
These havens are all over the 
world, usually manned by a Toad.

When you're exhausted, you
should stay at one and recover.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the Bub-ulbs.
Bub-ulbs are a type of talking
plant. Aren't they hilarious? 

I think they come from Flower
Fields.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's Tayce T., by far the
greatest cook around.

Trust me, my mom is a really
great cook,

but even she admits that she
could learn a thing or two
from Tayce T.

Tayce T. will cook for you if you
take ingredients to her.
C'mon, let's ask her!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad guards the path to
Forever Forest.

He looks timid... Isn't that a
bad trait in a guard?

Not only does he scare easily,
I hear that he's especially
afraid of ghosts.

Seeing as Forever Forest is 
supposedly haunted, he must be
completely freaked out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is diligent and very
hard working.
He has a great work ethic.

I heard he has a bit of a crush
on Merluvlee, who lives on
Shooting Star Summit.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She worships Tayce T. because
she really loves to cook.
She's usually right here.

I guess she's kind of Tayce T.'s
cooking apprentice right now.

My mother also admires Tayce T.
She always says that she wants
to learn how to cook from her.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad can't keep his mouth
shut.
He's an incurable gossip.

I have to wonder what he says
behind our backs...
To be honest, I'd love to find
out.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He always talks about what he
wants to be when he grows up.

He's constantly changing his
goals. I guess that's natural.

It's good to have a dream to
chase, don't you think?

I have a couple dreams. I'm
living one of 'em right now!

Who'd have thought I'd actually
have an adventure with Mario?!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is pretty smart.
I wonder where he gets all of his
information.

There's a rumor that this is the
Toad who writes the Toad Town
Times.

There's also a rumor that Luigi
is the one who writes it. I
wonder which rumor is true?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is constantly running
his mouth.
When I'm with Gooma, he boasts
about his pet a lot.

He's a huge gossip.
You can't believe everything he
says.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a flower. I guess that's
pretty obvious...
It doesn't seem to move like an
ordinary flower, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! A Bub-ulb.
Talking flowers seem weird...

Didn't I hear that Bub-ulbs live
in Flower Fields?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the station master of Dry
Dry Railroad in Toad Town.

The motto of Dry Dry Railroad is,
"We are generous, polite and
safe." Yeah, that's catchy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad never seems to leave
the station.
He loves trains, so he makes
excuses to travel all over.

When he's not on one of his
trips, he watches the trains at
the station.
Did I mention he loves trains?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's a very caring Toad.

Just by the way she talks, I get
the sense that she's generous
and carefree.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's just an average Toad.
He apparently knows a lot about
Dry Dry Desert.

He goes there a lot.
For work...? Oh, I don't know.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad kid acts like an adult.
He's always talking about his
travels.

His favorite trip so far has
been on Dry Dry Railroad.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These Toad kids always seem to
be together.

They share all their secrets with
each other.

They're really good friends.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad loves Li'l-Oinks. I
always see him near Li'l-Oink
Farm.

He keeps an eye on the Li'l-Oinks
from outside the fence.
Obviously, he really likes 'em.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He runs a shop.
He buys, sells and checks items.

Checking is very convenient if
you have a lot of items.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He talks a lot, this guy.
Say, since I travel with you, do
you think I'll be famous, too?

I wonder if there's any gossip
about me yet.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This guy is pretty wary.
He doesn't believe most of the
rumors that people spread.

But he wants attention, so he
listens well and keeps the
rumors alive.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Look at these cheerful kids!
Everything is just fun and
games to them.

Boy... I feel like a grown-up 
when I look at kids having such
carefree fun!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
They're just some Toad children,
having a good time outdoors.
You have to be careful when
they're quiet.

You know kids. They're probably
up to some mischief.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad kid who follows the
other two.
He's a little bit shy.

When they pick on him, though,
he always fights back and he 
never, ever loses.

Despite that, I think those three
are really good friends.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's always taking a walk
around here.
She's elegant, don't you think?

She's almost too nice to be 
really elegant, though. Maybe
she needs to learn to be more
snobby.

Then she'd seem really elegant!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think this Toad is a guide.
He wants to be a Tour
Conductor, whatever that is.

He's also interested in unique
shops and items.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's part of the Great Gossip
Trio. He can't get enough gossip.

They've dedicated their lives to
listening to gossip, so they
should know everything.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's part of the Great Gossip
Trio.
I wonder when they're gonna get
bored with all those rumors.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's part of the Great Gossip
Trio.

I wonder how they keep on top of
it all? So much gossip!

I'd say your name comes up
pretty often, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These Toads just moved here.
This is the first time they've 
lived in an actual town.

I think they were worried that
it'd be too noisy in town.
This quiet area seems to suit
them well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These Toads just moved here.
They like peace and quiet.

They said they're enjoying living
here so far. They think it's
quite comfortable.

Well, you could just listen to
them yourself, Mario...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He claims that he can upgrade
your point levels...but there's
something suspicious about him.

I don't know... I just don't
trust him for some reason.

Who knows, though? I guess you
can't judge a book by its cover.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He runs this restaurant.
He just opened it. He also plays
a mean guitar.

I'm sure he'll be popular here.
I'd like to come here one day
with my whole family.

I don't like fish, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I really hate eating fish.
But fishing does look fun...
Fishing in the harbor must be
pretty relaxing.

My dad goes fishing, too.
I wonder if he knows this guy...

But seriously, I hate fish.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Fuzzipede.
What a weird little creature!

People use Fuzzipedes as fish
bait, but they often manage to
cut the line.

He's pretty robust for such a
little guy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Some folk are calling it a tuna,
but it's obviously a whale.
Pretty huge, isn't it?

I wonder how many Goombas would
fit inside one whale?

He may look scary, being so big,
but his eyes seem kind.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a waiter at this
restaurant. He said he's working
here because he longs to be near
Pop Diva.

He's really working hard!
I bet he's working hard to try
to impress her.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's a singer, the Pop Diva.
She...is...so...beautiful!

That big earthquake scared her
so badly that she forgot how
to sing.

It's such a pity. Her voice is
truly amazing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's a singer, the Pop Diva.
She...is...so...beautiful!

Oh! That voice!
That voice will haunt me!
I feel like I could listen to it
forever!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He writes songs. They call him
Master Poet.
He's a pretty cool guy.
He's in love with Pop Diva.

He's really worried about her.
I know just how he feels...
Mario, don't laugh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad. I think he's a guide
at the port. He goes like this:
Welcooooome! 

Pretty good, huh? Anyway, he
knows this area very well.
You can ask him all about it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Whenever I talk to this Toad, he
tells me he wants to go
"somewhere by the sea."

Sure, it'd be great if there
were an island to go relax on,
but what if he got out there
and there was only ocean?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad's been all over the
place. He'll tell you lots of old
stories.

I heard that he knows lots of
stories about Goompa and Koopa
Koot. Were they really that
famous?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad.
He seems to be taking a walk
and singing off key. Great tune,
though!

It kind of makes me want to
hang out and sing, too.
I'm a terrible singer, but this
guy might make me sound good!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the receptionist Toad for
the Playroom.
He'll tell you what games there
are to play.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He seems to be a customer at
the Playroom.
I bet he comes here all the time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He seems to come to the Playroom
often.
He's probably one of their best
customers.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad both explains and
judges the Playroom games.
This game is Jump Attack.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad both explains and
judges the Playroom games.
This game is Smash Attack.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's my grandpa, Goompa.
He knows oodles of stuff.

Ever since I was a kid, he's been
telling me fantastic stories of
his youth.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's my grandma, Gooma.
I hope she lives forever! She's
the greatest!

When she starts telling old
stories, she always says, "When
I was young, I was very popular
with the boys."
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's my dad, Goompapa.
He's willing to do anything for
us. We can always count on him.

He doesn't really look like it,
though.
But did you see him fixing stuff
after that earthquake?

That's when I knew he was cool.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's my mom, Goomama.

She sometimes gets on my nerves
when she worries too much about
me, but I still love her lots.

Don't tell her what I just said!
Seriously, Mario! Promise me!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's my sister, Goombaria.

She's a spoiled girl, but still,
everyone's always nice to her.
Why? 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a regular Toad.
He was sent here from Princess
Peach's Castle.

He's the manager of this Toad
House.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's Luigi.
I don't have to say anything
about him, do I? He's your
brother!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad House employee.
He was sent here from Princess
Peach's Castle.

He runs this Toad House.
He looks kind of bored.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Koopa Troopa merchant
who sells goods.
He also checks and buys stuff.

You might want to buy some
stuff from him if we're going
somewhere dangerous.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Koopa Troopa from scenic
Koopa Village.
He's like the welcome wagon.

He seems to be a pretty jolly
Koopa Troopa.
Just look at his face! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Is it only my imagination or did
Koopa Troopas used to walk
around on four legs?

I guess that was a really long
time ago, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Koopa Troopas sunbathe in their
shells when it's sunny out.

Supposedly, a lot of Koopa
Troopas set trends and are
totally fashionable.

I guess they have different
tastes from mine...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Koopa Troopa obviously loves
the radio.
He's always listening to it.

He seems to prefer music to the
news reports.

Who wouldn't? I like music, too.
How about you, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Bob-omb.
He used to work inside Koopa
Bros. Fortress.

Now he lives here among the
Koopa Troopas.

He sometimes blows up at very
inappropriate times.
Not that it's such a big deal,
but somebody might get mad.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Bob-omb.
He's from inside the walls of
Koopa Bros. Fortress.

Even if he explodes, you'll be
fine as long as you stay a good
distance away.

You never know when these Bob-
ombs might go off!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Bob-omb.
He used to be stuck in the jail
at Koopa Bros. Fortress. He
must have escaped.

Now he lives with his friends in
Koopa Village.

Koopa Village is quite the
popular place now. 
I wonder how they're dealing with
the population boom.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's the wife of Kolorado, who's
an archaeologist and explorer.
She always worries about him.

You know, I like adventure, too.
I can totally see my future wife
being like that, always worried
about brave Goombario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a pity that he's missing his
shell. How embarrassing!

His name is Kooper.
I wonder if he'd be our friend
for life if we got his shell back
for him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the oldest Koopa in Koopa
Village.
His name is Koopa Koot.

He's famous for being selfish,
stingy and impatient.

He doesn't ask for things that
are impossible, but you can bet
the tasks will be hard and time-
consuming.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Koopa Troopa from Koopa
Village.

You know, when Koopas are in a
hurry, they slide on the
undersides of their shells.

You wouldn't see anyone doing
that around here. These guys
are never in a hurry.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Koopa Troopa from Koopa
Village.

As you can see, most Koopa
Troopas are easygoing but a
little bit shy.

There are some exceptions, but
he seems to be typical.
You gotta love the easygoing
types, huh, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Koopa Troopa from Koopa
Village.
He's easygoing, but he seems to
have a sense of justice, too.

Sometimes the fight for justice
is dangerous, you know. 

Goompa told me that we must
always be strong inside, or else
we could get hurt.

I'm trying to be strong, just
like this Koopa. I respect him
for that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Koopa Troopa from Koopa
Village.

He's pretty mellow.
He doesn't even care if he's 
surrounded by all kinds of noise.

As long as nothing interferes
with his personal space, he
doesn't care what goes on
in town.

It must be nice to have a such
stress-free personality.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Bob-omb.
He was jailed at Koopa Bros.
Fortress. He probably came here
after escaping.

The kind Koopa Troopas welcomed
him with open arms. How
neighborly!
He must be overjoyed.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Bob-omb was in jail at
Koopa Bros. Fortress.
He decided to settle here.

With his friends as roommates,
it's bound to be noisy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Bob-omb who was in jail at
Koopa Bros. Fortress.
He made a home in Koopa Village.

I always thought that all Bob-
ombs did was continually blow
each other up, but...
I guess I was wrong.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's named Bombette.
That pink is adorable!

She does seem to be pretty
strong willed.
Her future boyfriend might be in
for some trouble!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Bob-omb's been jailed.
I wonder what he did to the
Koopa Bros.? 

I thought that Bob-ombs and
Koopa Bros. worked together in
harmony...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Bob-omb's been jailed.
Do the Koopa Bros. have short
tempers, you think?

If we had a Bob-omb on our side
during battle,
it would really catch the Koopa
Bros. off guard.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Bob-omb's been jailed.
It really seems to dislike the 
Koopa Bros. 

Say, I wonder who'll live here if
we manage to boot out the Koopa
Bros.?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That Bob-omb's been jailed.
I wonder if they get hurt when
they blow themselves up?

I mean, they blow up all the
time, so they must enjoy it.

Once they start exploding, they
can't stop!
It blows my mind!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Kent C. Koopa. He's...
pretty large and greedy. He
seems to be in our way...

We can't slip past him because
he's too big, but he'll let us go
by if we give him some coins.

He's huge, but remember, he's
just a Koopa Troopa.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the station master at the
Mt. Rugged Station. 
He looks just like the one in
Toad Town. Why is that?

Is it because of his uniform...
or the pattern on his head?
Pretty cool uniform, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's Parakarry, a Paratroopa
who delivers letters.
He's got some problems.

It must be nice to have wings.
He can fly anywhere.
All postmen should have wings.

You know, some people say that
if you help someone in trouble,
good things will happen to you.
You know, karma.

What? You've never heard that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad works at the local
travel agency.
It's called Toad Town Tours.

They like to personally inspect
sites for future tours.

I wonder what people could
possibly want to see in the
desert or on Mt. Rugged?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Dryite.
He hangs around this station all
the time.

He must like traveling by train,
I guess.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A flower, I think.
But... Do most flowers move like
that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! A Bub-ulb.
I don't know why, but they give
out Seeds.

Boy, if there are lots of these
guys in Flower Fields, it must be
a hopping place!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Whacka.
When you hit Whackas, they get
Bumps that fall off.
I heard that they're yummy.

You know, I'm not normally into
hitting Whackas, but once I 
heard of their tasty Bumps... I
got the urge to whack 'em!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad loves to study the
creatures of the world.

She's really into conservation.
She doesn't want anything to
become extinct. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the archaeologist, Kolorado.
He's famous as both a scholar
and an explorer.

Unfortunately, he's also
renowned for his carelessness.

He's wild about treasures and
ancient secrets, so he's always
taking off around the world on 
some adventure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Koopa Troopa from the
excavation team.
The team is assisting Kolorado.

That looks like hard work. I
wouldn't want to do it.
Doing chores in this heat? Ugh!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Koopa Troopa from the
excavation team.
The team is assisting Kolorado.

People say that excavations are
about as boring as you can
imagine until you find something.
I bet that's true.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Nomadimouse.
It looks like he's in mid-journey.

I bet he has some amazing
stories to tell...

A wandering Nomadimouse...
Roaming the world...no
responsibilities... So lucky!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He runs the shop here in Dry Dry
Outpost. I don't know... He acts
kind of strange.

Is he nervous...?

Well, he may be suspicious, but
he still runs the shop.
His stock seems to be made up
of pretty normal stuff.

I think it's normal...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Nomadimouse who lives in
this town.
He seems to pay special
attention to strangers, like us.

He belongs to some kind of shady
organization.
The organization rules Dry Dry
Outpost.

So mysterious and dangerous... I
can feel my skin crawling! 
Mario,
isn't this exciting?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Dryite.

The wind out here in the desert
is full of stinging sand, so he
protects himself by wrapping his
face in a cloth.

Since their faces are covered,
it's tough to tell them apart.
I'm pretty sure they're all
adults, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dryites look like the heat
doesn't even bother them.

I wonder why? I'm boiling! And
they're all wrapped up in
clothes! What gives?

Maybe it's because their clothes
are wrapped loosely.
I could use some threads like
that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Dryite is really quiet.
He's shy, I guess.

But...
I don't see any reason for him
to be so timid.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These Dryites look like they have
big heads because they're
wrapped in cloth.

It's hard to tell them apart
since we can see only their eyes.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toaaad in the Deserrrt♪
...Sorry. This guy's music moved
me to song.

How about some karaoke!
...Just joking.

This composer seems pretty
jolly, doesn't he?
He makes me wanna dance!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Dryite.
I've seen him in Toad Town.

He earned himself a Degree at
the Toad Town Dojo.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Dryite has been seen in
Toad Town.

Why does he look like he's
worried about something?
Whenever I worried, my Goompa
always told me...

"When you're feeling lost, ask
Merlon to show the way."
Merlon's fortune-telling is
surprisingly accurate.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Sheek.
You'd think the guy could shake
the dust from his clothes!

If I didn't know he was an 
information trader, I'd say we
should steer clear of him.

Still, he's our best source for
gossip... As adventurers, we
have to deal with all kinds!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Da Da Da Duuum!

Sheek revealed his true self!
...I guess that means he's the 
boss everyone talks about.

Oh... I was expecting Moustafa
to look a lot cooler.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad.
He was sent here from Princess
Peach's Castle.

I tell you, there's nothing like
a quick, refreshing nap!
Plus, it's free!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's a wizard, Merlee. She
casts spells.

If you let her cast a spell on
you, it may affect you in battle.

She's one of a pair of twins. The
other one is Merluvlee, from
Shooting Star Summit.

When I look at a woman as
beautiful as this,
it makes me feel all strange! ♥
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Dryite.

It's hard to tell whether he's
old or young because of that
cloth that's wrapped around his
face.

What do you think? Young or old?
I'm betting young...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Dryite.

This guy looks to be pretty
easygoing.
Who can be easygoing in this
heat? I'm cooking!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Nomadimouse who never
strays from the back street in
Dry Dry Outpost. He loves to
stay near the lovely wizard.

Ah, a rival for her affections!

Just joking.
He's obviously fond of Merlee.

Maybe he just doesn't have
anywhere better to go. He's
always just sitting here.

There's no reason to move... His
beloved is here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Nomadimouse who likes
telling old tales. He knows much
of the history of this town.

The legend surrounding this town
is very mysterious.

I wish my hometown had such a
cool legend! Then I could act
mysterious.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Dryite has been to Shooting
Star Summit.
I bet he was pretty impressed.
And cold.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Oaklie. He lives in
Forever Forest.

He guards the entry to Forever
Forest to prevent wanderers
from getting lost.

He helps any townsfolk who get
lost inside.
That beard... For some reason,
I feel like yanking it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a flower. I think...
It doesn't seem to move like an
ordinary flower, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! It's a Bub-ulb.
The flower we saw must be the
top of his head.

He hands out Seeds. I'm willing
to bet that these Seeds are
really important.
Let's plant 'em, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Boo called Bootler.
He's the manager of the mansion
and the personal assistant of
Lady Bow.

Ordinarily his title would
be "butler."
Being a butler is hard work.

Hmm... Maybe I'm just imagining
this, but doesn't it look like
he's enjoying himself?

Maybe he likes hard work??
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Boo runs the shop.

Nice selection, huh? I'm sure
he's cornered the Boo market
around here.

Maybe he was a merchant before
he became a Boo.

I bet Bow orders most of this.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who works at Boo's
Mansion.
He seems to really like this
gloomy place.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Boos in this mansion are all
big fans of Bow.

This Boo is no exception, but
he's also interested in the
outside world.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Boo is guarding a treasure
chest.
Bow told him to, I guess.

She must be pretty scary to
command such obedience!

Say, don't you think that Boos
have the funniest expressions?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Boo appeared as soon as
you took those Boots.
He looks to me like he might have
some useful information.

It can't hurt to have a listen,
Mario. Why don't you lend him
an ear?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

He's in love with Bow.

If he can occasionally see Bow,
his life is complete.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

Have you ever looked closely at
Boos? I think they have really
charming faces.

Just like other creatures, there
are some that are cute and some
that just aren't.
Which is which, though...?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

You know, Boos can't be
attacked if they're invisible.
Isn't that convenient?

Whenever trouble appears, they
can just disappear until the
coast is clear again.

I guess they're only in danger if
they're taken by surprise.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

This land is totally barren. I
wonder what Boos find to eat
around these parts.

Oh yeah. They're ghosts. I guess
maybe they don't need to eat
anything.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

Consider this: Is this place
lonely because Boos make their
home here,

or do Boos live here because this
place is lonely?

....
That riddle's gonna keep me up
all night.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.
Boos live in this wasted land and
scare people.

They also take scare-trips to
Forever Forest for fun.
It must be fun having nothing to
do except scare people.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

It's hard to tell if they're male
or female, isn't it?
They should all wear bows like
Bow does. That'd make it easier.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

You know, I think it's possible
for a ghost to be cute and
scary at the same time.

It all depends on the person
they're scaring. What's cute to
one may be horrifying to another.

This Boo doesn't look that scary.
He looks too nice.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a Boo who lives here in
Gusty Gulch.

Don't you think Boos have
expressive faces?

They must do special face
exercises to be able to stretch
them so much. 
Pulling a face muscle would hurt.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Boo's hiding in Tubba
Blubba's Castle.
The castle is terrifying for
Boos, so this guy has guts.

He must have come to try to find
the secret of Tubba Blubba.
That monster must have some
weakness hidden here!

This Boo is willing to risk his
own life! So brave...

You know,
no other Boos will dare come here
because Tubba Blubba eats any
Boos he finds.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Yakkey, a magical key.
It was lucky for us that it
spilled the beans about Tubba
Blubba's secret...

But I wonder what it's going to
do...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's a brave Boo.
Even though he knows he may be
eaten, he's willing to try to
help us. How noble!

You know,
it takes a lot of guts to walk
straight into the mouth of
danger to help others.

I guess he came partly to help
us but mostly to help Bow.
Every Boo loves Bow, after all.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Everyone left while this Clubba
was sleeping.
He must be really tired.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's Gourmet Guy.
Woow! He's huuuuge!

Does this guy ever stop eating?
He looks like he'd eat until his
stomach blew up!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's an employee of the Toy
Box station.

The employees drive the trains
from one station to another and
announce the destinations.

Don't you think he looks like the
station masters at Toad Town
and Mt. Rugged Stations?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Say... This is the lantern that
belongs to the Big Lantern
Ghost. There's something inside.

Do you think it'd come out if we
broke it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a guard named Anti Guy.
He's all by himself! And he looks
totally weak!

Although...you never know.
Appearances can be deceptive.
Just look at me!
Hmm... Weak? Or really strong?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Shy Guy is just causing
trouble in here.
He's pretending to shop, but
he's not buying anything.

Hey, buy something or get out,
pal! You hear me?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the Village Leader.
He's very dignified.

Doesn't he look thoughtful and
perceptive?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Yoshi who is an old
friend of the Village Leader.

They've known each other since
they were kids. I hear they've
pulled many a prank together!

They must be really close pals if
they've been friends for so long.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a blue Yoshi.
He's just hanging out here.

Maybe he's a Marine Yoshi! You
know, because he's blue?
...OK, maybe not.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Yoshi is really easy to talk
to.
I bet everybody likes him. He's
so friendly!

My Goompa once read me a book
that had a Yoshi in it, but I
never really thought that they
existed.

It's so exciting to see 'em!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Yoshi.
This Yoshi always hangs out
around the village entrance.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Yoshi.
I've seen pictures in books of
these guys.

I want to ride on one's back!
It's always been a childhood
dream of mine...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Yoshi loves food like
nobody's business!

I wonder what he'd do if we gave
him some food made by Tayce T.?
He'd freak out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a green Yoshi kid. He's an
excitable rascal, huh?
Yoshi kids get pretty big.

All he wants to do is explore
beyond his village.
I know how he feels.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a blue Yoshi kid.
He thinks he's different from
other Yoshi kids.

What a cute little guy!
I can see how he might get on
your nerves, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a purple Yoshi kid.
Not a care in the world!

Very cute.
He seems to like you, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a yellow Yoshi kid. Whoa!
He's cheery, huh?
This kid is full of pep.

I was the same back in the days
when I was small.

What?I'm still small?
Well, yeah, compared to you, I
guess I'm still wet behind the
ears.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yoshi kids are so cheerful.
This red Yoshi kid, though, looks
pretty mischievous.

He looks like a little scamp. I
bet he gets into all sorts of
trouble and doesn't regret it a
bit.

What? That's like me?
Marioooo! C'mon! Take it back!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Yoshi who's set up a
little shop on the island.
He sells, checks and buys items.

Remember, shops are different
in different parts of the world.

I see items in this shop that you
can't get anywhere but here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Raven.

Ravens are short and chubby.
They're pretty fluffy, too. And
somewhat cuddly. And soft.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Raven.

Ravens are really cute.
I told Kooper that, and he said I
had weird taste.

What's so weird about that?
Aren't they cute, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Raven.

He looks good in black.
Can we take him with us, Mario?

He doesn't want to go?
What a bummer...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Raven.

Ravens only say "caw" unless
they think they have something
really important to tell you.

They only tell important stuff to
people they trust.
I wish they'd tell us something.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Raven.

Ravens are really cute.
I told Kooper that, and he said I
had weird taste.

What's so weird about that?
Aren't they cute, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the Toad of the Toad House.
He was sent here from Princess
Peach's Castle.

This Toad House is kind of a
Resort Hotel.
The Toad here seems to like his
job. It's one long vacation!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's a Cheep Cheep. Her name is
Sushie.
She's sort of meddlesome.

At least that's what the Yoshi
kids say. According to them, she
tries to control their lives.

I think she's just trying to take
care of them, but she doesn't
seem to be succeeding. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's Raphael the Raven, the
guardian of this jungle.
Look at the size of this guy!
He's enormous!

I bet there's nothing he can't
do.
Doesn't he seem trustworthy?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a flower, I guess.
It doesn't seem to move like an
ordinary flower, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Oh! A Bub-ulb.

I don't know why it's growing
here.
It's a very strange flower,
don't you think?

This Seed... 
I bet it's something very
important.
Important to Bub-ulbs, anyway.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Heart Plant.

These grow only on Lavalava
Island. When you touch one, it
gently stretches out its stem to
welcome you.

If you're lucky, it'll also give
you a heart when it uncoils.
Nice, huh?

There's a species of mean plant
that imitates it, though.
Is this one good or bad?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
M. Bush.
This bizarre creature is only
found in the jungles of Lavalava
Island.

It pretends to be a bush, but
it's actually a hunter waiting
to surprise prey. I don't wanna
be prey. Do you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Bub-ulb.
It's one of many talking flowers
in Flower Fields.

Boy, it seems like as soon as
creatures learn to communicate,
they learn to gossip.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You know, a lot of the flowers in
Flower Fields will answer you if
you talk to 'em.

They're probably our best source
of news around here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A lot of flowers live here, huh?
They're so...so very...

uh...beautiful, I guess.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Bub-ulb.
The flowers around here hate
cloudy weather. They need the
sun's rays!

I don't like the rain, either,
because I can't play outside.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Tolielip.

He definitely knows a lot about
Flower Fields.

Unfortunately, he's a liar.
You can figure out his riddles,
can't you, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a red flower that guards a
gate.
Red is a passionate color.

Goombaria knows a lot about the
subtle languages of flowers and
colors.

She talks and talks and talks
until I can't take it anymore!
As a result, I've learned a lot
of what she knows.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a yellow flower that guards
a gate.
Yellow is a friendly color.

Yellow also means "Caution!" in
many cultures, though.
Maybe we should be careful...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a blue flower that guards a
gate.
Blue... It's the color of the sea 
and sky.

It's supposed to calm you. I also
heard that it can ruin your
appetite for some reason.
Do you think that's true?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This flower is named Petunia.
She's obsessed with Seeds.
She's pretty talkative.

She says she doesn't do anything
with the Seeds. She just collects
them.

Collecting Seeds? Talk about a
boring hobby!
Don't you think so, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's Posie. A lily.
She looks generous and kind,
doesn't she?

Of course, sometimes the kindest
looking characters turn into the
scariest when you make 'em mad.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
That's Lily. She says she's
guarding this spring.
I get the sense that she's easily
distracted.

She's off in her own little world
a lot of the time. It's kind of a
problem if you want to get any
information from her.

She seems to drift off even while
you're talking to her.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What do you know? A rose called
Rosie! She loves it here in the
garden.
She's pretty full of herself.

I guess she thinks she's the
prettiest of all flowers.

She is quite beautiful...
She has a strange way of
expressing herself, though...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the sun.
Some people call it the "Blessed
Sun."

It's the source of life for
flowers and trees. If it doesn't
come out, eventually all plants
wither away.

Sunshine makes me happy, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Lakilester's girlfriend, 
Lakilulu.

When they have arguments, she
never backs down.
What a cute couple!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Bubble Plant.

It looks like blowing bubbles
makes him really happy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These followers of Bowser run
the Puff Puff Machine.

They're continuing their evil
plan to fill this fair land with
clouds.

Boy, Bowser and his goons think
up the strangest ways to mess
with our world, huh? They're
really quite creative.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
She's the wife of Mayor Penguin,
who's the mayor of Shiver City.
She has a bit of a problem with
exaggeration.

She loves mystery novels and
longs to be a great detective.

The way I see it, she's a bit too
flighty to be a detective.

You, however... I think you'd
make a great sleuth, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the mayor of Shiver City,
Mayor Penguin.

He's a good friend of
Herringway, another penguin.
Everyone in the village relies
on him.

He's a little absentminded, but
he does his job well.

I know I've seen him in Toad Town
before. I wonder if he's been to
the castle?
Ever seen him before, Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin who likes gossip. He
wanders around the city.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a friendly penguin.
He seems to be very fair.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a cheerful penguin.
He looks fun but a bit reckless.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There aren't many non-penguins,
so we stand out in this city.

I wonder what this penguin
thinks about us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the penguin who sells things
in this shop.
He also keeps and buys items.

By the way, is it only my
imagination or are you the only
person who ever shops here? I've
never seen anyone else here.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad of the northern lands
runs the Toad House.
He was sent here from Princess 
Peach's Castle.

It must be tough working in such
a cold place.
I wonder what he does to keep
his spirits up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These penguins love rumors. They
gather together just to gossip.
Especially about other people.

The tiniest little rumor will
spread like wildfire around here
if they hear it.

Their gossip stays in town,
so that's something, at least.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He likes rumors. He doesn't look
like the adventurous type at all.

If he wants some excitement
instead of just gossip, he should
eat a Volt Shroom.
That'd give him a jolt!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin gossips, but at 
least he takes the time to
confirm rumors that he hears.

He can still be wrong, though.

It doesn't matter if he confirms
his sources if the entire basis
of the rumor is false.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a pretty easygoing penguin
who always gossips.

I mean, I like gossip, but...
don't these guys get bored
recycling all the same rumors?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin likes to gossip.
He never goes outside the city,
though. He just wanders around
here, where it's safe.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin's been to the Dojo
in Toad Town.

He likes to show off his
certificate and compare it to
ones other people got at the
Dojo.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's the penguin patrol!
Guardian of the city!

He does an adequate job as an
investigator, but I wouldn't
count on his skills too much.

When trouble arises, I think that
Mario is the best man for the
job!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin is the gatekeeper.
He guards the city gate night
and day.

He keeps track of anyone coming
or going through Shiver City.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin made a secret room
in his house to hide in. What a
cool idea!
He's a friend of Mayor Penguin.

His name is Herringway, and he
writes mystery novels.

His secret study, where he
writes his novels, is on the
second floor.

I imagine that he has lots of
fans in this city, so I can see
why he'd need a secret room.

I wouldn't mind reading one of
his novels someday.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin has mastered many
ways to play with snow and ice.
He looks like he could have fun
anywhere cold.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin likes skating,
but he likes rumors even more.
Boy, penguins sure do love their
rumors, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin is guarding the
warehouse.
But he lost the Warehouse Key.

...Not the best job of guarding.
I guess he figures that he'll
just stand there staring and
pretend he's doing a good job.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This penguin's camped out by
Herringway's house.

What's he staring at? Is he even
awake?
He really enjoys looking up at
the night sky.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a timid penguin.
He's terrified of the unknown
and is constantly jumping.

I wonder who's a bigger coward,
this guy or the Toad at Forever
Forest?
My money's on the Toad.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's Merle, the person who
controls this valley.
He's the one who called you.
He's the son of Merlon.

That means...

Merle must be the father of the
fortune-tellers Merluvlee and
Merlow.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is taking care of the
Star Kids.
He's dressed for the weather.

I don't know why he needs to
dress in such warm clothes. His
head looks like it'd keep him
warm all by itself.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is taking care of the
Star Kids.

It must be tough running after
such rascals in deep snow.

I mean, Star Kids can fly! It's
gotta be tough for a Toad to
keep track of 'em while walking
on the ground.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad is taking care of the
Star Kids.

Some people say that taking
care of kids is like fighting a
war every day.

I think these Star Kids are OK,
though. I'm sure they're grateful
for their baby-sitter's hard
work.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the Ninjis.

The Ninjis are taking care of
the Star Kids.
Merle is in charge. He seems
really busy, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the Ninjis.

Because the Ninjis are so small,
it must be hard for 'em to keep
the Star Kids in line.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the Ninjis.

The Ninjis are excellent
baby-sitters for the Star Kids.
Of course, they have to run
around constantly, but hey.

They're working really hard.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Star Kid who isn't allowed
to go up to the sky.
It doesn't seem to have
affected his spirits, though.

It's no use worrying about these
little guys now, Mario. We'll
help 'em soon!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's one of the Star Kids.

Hey, maybe if we make friends
with the Star Kids now, they'll
grant us tons of wishes later!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Star Kid thinks he's made
himself invisible.
He wants to go up to the sky.

OK, but,
it's hard to imagine this little
prankster granting anyone's
wishes...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Toad.
He was sent here from Princess
Peach's Castle. He runs the local
Toad House.

He doesn't have to take care of
any Star Kids.
He has his own job.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the Ninjis.
The Ninjis take care of the Star
Kids.
I hear that they're great cooks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Star Kid--just a baby.
Star Kids are so full of life,
aren't they?

I always wanted a younger
brother, you know.
It would be fun to get into
hijinks with a little bro.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Star Kid. She's so cute!
She reminds me of Goombaria.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Star kid.
He wants a younger brother.
Hey, so do I!

I hope he becomes a great star
one day.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a snowman.

There're so many of snowmen!
They don't melt because it's cold
here.

The way they're standing...they
remind me of gatekeepers.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is an Albino Dino.
He looks exactly like that stone
statue over there.

He's a guard for this palace.

I never thought you could talk to
these creatures! Wouldn't it be
something if we made friends
with these guys?

You know,
it seems that they like facing
us when we talk to 'em.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Star sells things in this
shop.
He also checks and buys items.

There must be some extremely
rare items here.
Did you find anything good,
Mario?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's running an inn.
It's just like a Toad House.

I never thought we'd find one in
Star Haven.

This is the first time I've seen
a Toad House with no Toad.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Star Haven resident.

He doesn't look well.
Doesn't he know that we rescued
all the Star Spirits?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a Star Haven resident.

He looks like he doesn't have a
care, even though Bowser still
has the Star Rod.

He probably thinks he can't help.

Well, to tell the truth, he
probably can't, but
shouldn't he at least show a
little bit of concern?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Star Haven resident.

It's sad that these wish-
granters aren't more energetic.
Only the Star Spirits are lively.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Star Haven resident.

These guys believe that
everything will be fine since
the Star Spirits have returned.

There's still work to be done!

I mean, I'm sure it seems great
to have the Star Spirits back,
but the fight's not over!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Star Haven resident.

He's filled with hope, now that
the Star Spirits are back.

It must be tough to wish on a
Star when you happen to be a
Star yourself.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad worked in the castle.
Even though he's in a fix, he's
still worrying about Princess
Peach.

What a brave soul! Doesn't he
know that people are worried
about him back home?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad's been captured.
He looks like he's all right.

I wonder where he worked in
Peach's Castle?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He was a soldier at Princess
Peach's Castle. He was captured
in the takeover.

That must have been a pretty
bad scene.

He looks like he's recovering.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the Toad Minister.
Uh... Pleasure to meet you! My
name is Goombario, sir.
I'm Mario's right hand, sir.

Just joking.
But seriously, one day I'd love
to be invited to a castle party.
How about it?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad's been captured.
Somehow he's been able to set up
a Toad House here. How lucky for
us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad's been captured.
It must've been scary to be 
captured, but he looks like he's
all in one piece.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of the captured Toad
Soldiers.
These guys are counting on you!

Let's not let 'em down!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Dryite.

He came to the party and was
dragged into this mess.
He seems to be really cold. He 
must miss the desert.

We have to defeat Bowser as
fast as we can and get all these
brave folks back home.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad's been captured.
He's set up a Toad House.
We should be thankful for his
sacrifice.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad's been captured.
He spends his days worrying
about other people.

I guess he doesn't realize how
many people are worried about
him.

We have to get him home to the
people who miss him.
We must!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's a soldier from Peach's
Castle. He says he's ashamed
that he failed.

He and the others tried their
best, but they were overcome by
Bowser's troops.

The fiends who follow Bowser
must be tough customers...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a penguin from Shiver City.

I wonder how he scored an
invitation to the party? He must
know somebody at the castle or
something.

Or maybe he was just wandering
and got lost...
I never get lost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He's one of Bowser's followers.
He got bored guarding the
storage room and decided to
start selling stuff.

Wow, his job must have been
really, really boring. I can
imagine.

You've gotta wonder, though...
I bet if someone found out that
he sold stuff to Mario, he'd get
punished big time.

Maybe he doesn't know who you
are, though...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It looks like Princess Peach,
but something just doesn't seem
right...

I mean, I've never met the
Princess, but I thought she was
more...sweet.

Hey Mario,
is she really Princess Peach?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This Toad was hiding out in that
chest. He's gonna open a Toad
House here.

Hey Mario,
isn't that a stroke of luck?
We'll be able to take a rest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Hammer can shatter this
block.

Break it down, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Hammer isn't strong enough
to break this block.

You might be able to break it
with a more powerful Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Hammer can shatter this
block.

Break it down, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Hammer isn't strong enough
to break this block.

You might be able to break it 
with a more powerful Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Your Hammer can shatter this
block.

Break it down, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a brick block.
You can break it by jumping or
by Hammering it.

You might find something inside
when you break it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a ? block.
If you smash it, you'll get
something from inside it.

A prize in every block! How
exciting!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You already smashed this!
Nothing more will come out. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a movable block.
You can push it around and even
stand on it if you want to.

My Goompa used to tell me
stories about these blocks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a red ? block.
If you smash it, you'll get
something from inside it.

A prize in every block! How
exciting!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a jump pad.
You can catch crazy air if you
jump on it.

If you use it right, you can
reach new heights.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a switch.
Something's bound to happen if
you jump on it or smash it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a big switch.
You may have to Spin Jump on
this one to activate it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a big switch.
You may have to Tornado Jump on
this one to activate it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a floor switch.
Something's bound to happen if 
you Spin Jump on it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a floor switch.
Something's bound to happen if 
you Tornado Jump on it. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a pipe.
It'll take us somewhere.

I've heard that they even lead
to faraway towns sometimes.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a padlock.
It looks like we need to find a
key to unlock it.

I wonder what's on the other
side of the door... Let's find
the key and find out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you see a ! over your head,
check the area with {A}.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a sign that points the way
to Dry Dry Desert.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is certainly a large rock.
It looks cracked... I wonder if
we could blow it up...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a treasure chest.
Let's open it! I've gotta know
what's inside there!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a treasure chest.
It looks like it's empty.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This box looks sort of fragile,
but you can't break it with the
power level you have now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a wooden box.
You can break it if you Spin
Jump on top of it.

There might be something inside.
Let's break it open to find out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a wooden box.
You can break it if you Tornado
Jump on top of it.

There might be something inside.
Let's break it open to find out!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This floor looks breakable, but
you can't smash it with the
power level you have now.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can break this floor if you
Spin Jump on top of it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You can break this floor if you
Tornado Jump on top of it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a jack-in-the-box.
If you Spin Jump on it, you'll get
launched into the air.

You can also set it off by
smashing it with your Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a jack-in-the-box.
If you Tornado Jump on it, you'll
get launched into the air.

You can also set it off by 
smashing it with your Hammer.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Bellbell Plant.
It grows only on Lavalava Island
and swings like chimes when you
touch it.

It makes a cool, jingling sound.
Well... that's all it does...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Trumpet Plant.
It grows only on Lavalava Island
and blows star dust from inside
its flowers. 

Sometimes it'll blow out other
things, too, so be ready.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Cymbal Bush.
It grows only on Lavalava Island
and has two stiff petals growing
side by side.

If you disturb it, the petals
slam!
Wanna try? I dare you!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Munchlesia.

It grows only on Lavalava
Island. If you jump on it, it'll
wrap you up tight and take some
of your health.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Spinning Flower.
It grows only on Lavalava Island
and spins constantly.

If you press the {Z} button while
on the flower, you'll spin up into
the air for a while.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Bulb Bush.
It grows only on Lavalava 
Island. If you touch it, it'll
give out light for a little bit.

It also wiggles a little and will
sometimes surprise you.
I doubt it would surprise me.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
If you see a ! over your head,
check the object or the area
with {A}.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Goomba.

Goombas are what you'd call
"small fries." Actually, they're
pretty much the smallest fries.
...Hey, wait! I'm one of 'em!

Max HP: 2, Attack Power: 1
Defense Power: 0
You can jump on them or whack
'em with the Hammer.

These guys are old school.
They've been around since you
were in Super Mario Bros.!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Spiked Goomba.
Spiked Goombas are Goombas
with spikes on their heads.

Max HP: 2, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Whatever you do, don't jump on
their spikes or you'll get 
hurt or even paralyzed!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Paragoomba.
Obviously, Paragoombas are
Goombas with wings.

Max Hp: 2, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

You can't hit 'em with the
Hammer while they're airborne.

If you damage 'em, they'll fall
to the ground and become 
ordinary Goombas.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Red Goomba.
He's the older of the two
notorious Goomba Bros.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

The Goomba King ordered him
to try to stop you.

You can take this guy, no prob.
He has just a little more HP
than an ordinary Goomba.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Blue Goomba.
He's the younger of the two
notorious Goomba Bros.

Max HP: 6, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

As you heard in his little speech,
he's one of the Goomba King's
men.

He doesn't look that healthy.
He's weaker than his brother.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the Goomba King.
He's really big. I mean, look
at him! He looks really powerful.

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

He's the boss of Red Goomba
and Blue Goomba.
Who cares if he's strong?
You're much stronger.

Gee, I wonder what he ate
to become so big?
I'd like to be a bit bigger, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Goomnut Tree.
Spiky Goomnuts will fall down
if you hit this tree.

They'll definitely hurt if they
hit us, but it may be worth it 
to use them against the enemy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Koopa Troopa.
Everybody knows Koopa Troopas.
They're Bowser's followers.

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 1
Their shells are hard.

If you can flip 'em over,
their defense power will fall
to 0 and it will become much
easier for you to defeat 'em.

You can flip 'em with a POW
Block or a Jump attack. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Paratroopa.
No surprise here--Paratroopas
are Koopa Troopas with wings.

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 1

When you jump on 'em or use a
POW Block, their wings fall
off and they become normal
Koopa Troopas.

It's easy to beat 'em once
they're normal Koopa Troopas.
Give 'em another Jump attack!

They think they're pretty cool
because they wear sunglasses,
but they're not that tough.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Fuzzy.
Why do Fuzzies always jump
up and down? They need to
chill out!

Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

The problem with Fuzzies is their
quickness. It's really tough to
time their attacks.

If they latch on to you, watch
out! They'll absorb your HP.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Bob-omb.

Bob-ombs are pretty
temperamental, 
and they get steaming mad
when you attack 'em.

Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

You'd better not jump on 'em
when they're angry or they'll
blow up in your face.
In fact, stay away entirely.

Attack 'em from a distance with
items like Hammers.
Or you could send in other
things, like shells.

If they attack when angry,
they'll charge in and explode.
So you'd better take care of 
them before they blow!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Bullet Bill, 
a kamikaze attacker.

If you don't beat Bullet Bills
quickly, they'll slam into you
and explode.

Max HP: 2, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

I'm serious, Mario. These guys
will really make us pay if they
manage to hit us!

We have to beat 'em before they
get the chance to strike us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Bill Blaster.
Bill Blasters are the cannons
that shoot out Bullet Bills.

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 0,
Defense Power: 1

They won't attack us directly,
but they'll keep shooting out
Bullet Bills as long as they can.

It's efficient to attack 'em 
all at once, but you can also 
beat 'em one at a time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Bowser...?
But he looks kind of...lame. 
I mean, he's lame anyway, but...

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 1

Does Bowser really look like this?
I always imagined him looking,
well, a lot scarier.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Red Ninjakoopa.
He's the Koopa Bros. leader.


He's pretty much just a normal
Koopa Troopa, though.

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 1

He has a little bit of defense
power, but you can flip him
over by jumping on him, just
like a normal Koopa Troopa.

Let's flip him over quick!
Otherwise, the Bros. may form
a tower and do their famous
spinning attack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Black Ninjakoopa.
Black is pretty fashionable...

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 1

He has a little bit of defense
power, but you can flip him
over by jumping on him, just
like a normal Koopa Troopa.

Let's flip him over quick!
Otherwise, the Bros. may form
a tower and do their famous
spinning attack!

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Yellow Ninjakoopa.

Yellow reminds me of curry.
Isn't that a weird thing to
think of in the middle of
a battle?

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 1

He has a little bit of defense
power, but you can flip him
over by jumping on him, just
like a normal Koopa Troopa.

Let's flip him over quick!
Otherwise, the Bros. may form
a tower and do their famous
spinning attack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Green Ninjakoopa.
He looks exactly the same as a
normal Koopa Troopa.

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 1

He has a little bit of defense
power, but you can turn him
over by jumping on him, just
like a normal Koopa Troopa.

Let's flip him over quick!
Otherwise, the Bros. may form
a tower and do their famous
spinning attack!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Koopa Bros. have formed
a tall Koopa tower!

Max HP: ?, Attack Power: ?,
Defense Power: ?
I'm not sure about this...

They do a spinning attack
with the whole gang piled
high atop one another.

Hit 'em with a Hammer or
something to make 'em unstable.
After that, any attack should 
knock 'em down.

If you use an explosion, you
can make 'em fall down at once.

If you flip 'em over, the battle
will nearly be ours!
Beat 'em one by one!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
What was his name? Jr. Troopa?
I don't remember exactly...
...Just joking, kid!

Max HP: 15, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 1

He looks so adorable hiding in
his egg, doesn't he? So cute!

It should be a snap to
beat him now.
...I think.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Monty Mole.
Monty Moles are rock-throwing
moles, big time mischief-makers.

Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Ugh. They have kind of scary
looking faces.
They're pretty weak, though.

Maybe they wear sunglasses
because they have really
sensitive eyes.
Or maybe they're just hip.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Cleft.
Clefts are pretty strong, so
you'd better be careful.

Max HP: 2, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 2

Their specialty is pretending
to be rocks, so watch your step
on the mountain.

You'll get hurt if you jump
on the spikes on their heads.

You know, there's courage in
running away sometimes...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Pokey, an evil cactus.
Pokeys attack by throwing parts
of their bodies or by coming up
close and falling on you.

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Be careful fighting them!
It'll hurt if you jump on their
spiky heads!

They also have an annoying habit
of calling in reinforcements.
Let's beat 'em quickly!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Bandit.
Bandits bump into you hard
and shake up your pockets.
They can steal up to 10 coins. 

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

They'll slyly approach and then
slam into you all of a sudden.

If you can damage them in
an attack, you can get your
stolen coins back.

Let's beat 'em before they
can make off with our loot!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Pokey Mummy.

Pokey Mummies are Pokeys
that dried out and became
mummies then went to live
in the ruins. 

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Careful! They have spikes on
their heads!
Trust me--it'll hurt if you
jump on 'em.

The mummification also made
'em poisonous. If you get
poisoned when they attack you,
you'll take damage for a while.

What do you say we beat 'em
before they can poison us?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Buzzy Beetle.
Buzzy Beetles are cute--
but mean.

Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 2

Fire attacks don't work very
well against these hardheads.

If you can flip 'em, though,
their defense power falls to 0.
Keep flipping 'em, Mario!

I heard that they used to
flourish all over the place, but
now they're only found in dark,
shadowy places.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Swooper, a ghost bat.
Swoopers got their name
because they swoop down
out of the shadows.

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Even Jump attacks can't reach
'em when they're hanging on
the ceiling, but earth tremors
will knock 'em loose.

Parakarry can also knock 'em
loose with one of his moves.

You can attack 'em however
you choose once they're
hovering in the air.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Buzzar.
He guards Mt. Rugged.
Wow! That's one big bird!

Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

If you get caught in the
clutches of his sharp claws,
you'll lose 4 HP!
Try to wriggle out of his grip.

His special attack is flapping
his wings to create wind.
This attack damages your
party members, too.

But he was hatching eggs,
wasn't he? Is it possible
that he's really a she?
I wonder...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Tutankoopa.
He's one of Bowser's followers
and he's been assigned to guard
one of the Star Spirits.

I've heard that he has sort
of a pharaoh complex.

Max HP: 30, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

He attacks by throwing shells
from that high perch.

Try to dodge when he uses
magic: its attack power is 2
and it'll sting for sure.

And he also summons Chomps,
his loyal subjects.
Those Chomps have some serious
attack power.

Think hard about who to attack 
first, Tutankoopa or Chomp.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Chomp.
You've heard about Chomps
before, I'm sure.

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 3

They're made of such hard
stuff that most of your
attacks won't even faze them.

I heard a rumor that the
Chomps are a little peeved at
Tutankoopa because he works
them so hard.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Stone Chomp, who
guards the treasure in this
room.
He's made of stone. Duh!

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 1

His jaws can supposedly crush
a Coconut.
I don't know about you, but I
don't want to become a snack.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Piranha Plant.
Piranha Plants pop out of
the ground at unexpected
moments, so be on your guard.

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

You've seen 'em in every one
of your adventures, so I imagine
you know 'em pretty well.

Their sharp jaws point upward,
so you'll get bitten if you try
to jump on 'em.

They smile after biting people.
That smug smile...it makes me
hopping mad!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Forest Fuzzy.
Forest Fuzzies are always green.

Max HP: 6, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

If they grab hold of you,
they'll absorb your HP and add
it to their own. The fiends!
Those no good...

Oh! And they sometimes divide.
If they divide they become even
stronger, so try to beat 'em
before they can split.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Hyper Goomba.
Hyper Goombas are crazy,
uncivilized Goombas living
in Gusty Gulch.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

They sometimes charge their
power before attacking.

That charged attack will take
away 8 HP, so watch out when
they start to glow.

It's a good idea to use Bow or
an item to become transparent.
The attack will miss for sure.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Hyper Paragoomba.
Hyper Paragoombas are
Hyper Goombas with wings.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

They sometimes charge their
power before attacking.

That charged attack will take
away 8 HP, so watch out when
they start to glow.

It'll miss you if you can
become transparent.

Except for that, they're no
different from normal
Paragoombas, so use a Jump
attack to defeat 'em.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Hyper Cleft.
Hyper Clefts have more defense
power than normal Clefts.

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 3

They sometimes charge their
power before attacking.

That charged attack will take
away 8 HP, so watch out when
they start to glow.

It'll miss you if you can
become transparent.

Their defense power will fall
to 1 if you use an explosion
to flip 'em over.

And in case you hadn't noticed,
they have spikes up top!
It'll hurt if you jump on 'em.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Clubba.
Clubbas are the main guards of
Tubba Blubba's Castle.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

They often sleep on the job.
If you walk very slowly,
they won't wake up.

They may look big, but if you use
the action command perfectly,
they're not so tough.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Tubba Blubba.
He is one of Bowser's toughest
followers and he's the master
of this cursed castle.

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: ?
Hip Attack Power : 6

I don't know his defense power.
Everyone says he's invincible
because he has never been hurt.

I'd say it's a good idea to
run from immortal enemies!
If you get in deep trouble, Bow
can hide you from him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Tubba's Heart.
You might say it's the "heart"
of Tubba's secret. Ha!
OK, that wasn't funny.

Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 0

He has a terrible attack, so
hide when he tells you he's
about to unleash it.

This attack will take away
12 HP! Whoa!

Try to beat him before he can
do his huge attack again.
Trust me, it's dangerous.
This is Bow's turn to shine!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Tubba Blubba, now
reunited with his heart.
This is finally his true self.

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0 ...probably.

His Hip Attack causes 6
points worth of damage.

Be careful, because I'm not
exactly sure what his other
attacks can do.

...But...
I think he's definitely weaker
than before...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Jr. Troopa.
I can't get enough of this guy!

Waa ha ha ha!
Did the little guy get lost
in the big, bad forest?

Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 1

Apparently he's grown wings,
so he can fly now. You'll have
to jump to reach him.

He's a bit stronger, so it may
be worth it to use any items you
have to attack him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Shy Guy.
They're ne'er-do-wells.
Big time rascals. No good...  

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

They occasionally do acrobatic
attacks that have an attack
power of 3.

Who knows what lies in the
hearts of these troublemakers?
I guess they're dangerous, but
they're pretty small time.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Groove Guy.
Groove Guys wear weird clothes.
They're probably stage clothes.
Pssh... You know performers...

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

They shake their booties to
call in reinforcements.
They also spin around in front
of you and make you feel dizzy.

These rock 'n' rollers are a
drag, so let's ditch 'em as
fast as we can.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Spy Guy.
Spy Guys look like they're
ready for war in their spiffy
camouflage gear!

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

They change their weapons each
time they're attacked.

You'd best try to avoid their
hammer attack! Every time
you're hit by it, you'll lose
one of your commands!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Pyro Guy.
Pyro Guys are on fire, so any
contact with them will cause
damage.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

They're tough opponents, mainly
because their attack power is
so high.

Any attacks that involve water
or snow are our best bet
because...well...you know.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Sky Guy.
Sky Guys are master balloonists.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

We can attack the balloon, too.
Once they fall, they're just
like normal Shy Guys.

I wish I had a balloon so I could
float... That looks awesome!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Medi Guy.
Medi Guys are the emergency
workers of the Shy Guy clan.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

They have the power to heal
their wounded companions.
Of course, they also attack.

We'd better hurry up and take
them out of the mix. It's a
pain if they keep fixing all
the damage we do.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is an Anti Guy.
His attacks are so intense that
he's also called Deadly Guy.

Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 10,
Defense Power: 0

His attack power is 12
when he does an acrobatic
attack, so dodge it! 

This guy is for real, so we'd
better take him seriously.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Big Lantern Ghost.
He avoids attacks by hiding
in the dark.

Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0

Your friends, like (ahem) me,
will also be damaged when
he does the flash attack.
The flash attack's power is 2.

Hit the Lantern many times
to make it brighter, then
you'll be able to attack him.

As soon as you can see, hit
him right in the head!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is General Guy in his tank.
The tank seems to be dangerous
even though it's a toy.

Max HP: 30, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 2

Not only does the General give
commands from the tank, but he
also throws bombs and uses
electric attacks.

The power of his electric
attack is 5, and your party
member takes 2 damage points,
so defend yourself carefully.

He'll lose the electric attack
if we break the light bulb.

Normal fighting styles seem
ineffective because the tank
is well fortified.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the Shy Squad.
It'll attack us with all 
its members at once.

Max HP: 15, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

The number of times we're 
attacked will equal the number 
of Shy Guys in the Squad.  

Its attack power is huge when
there are many Guys, but it 
drops for each one that falls. 

Let's use an attack that does
tons of damage so we can
decrease their numbers and
increase our chances!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Shy Stack.
Whoa, this pile has an
incredible sense of balance!
Look at that stack!

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 1,
Defense Power: 0

Its attack power equals the 
number of Guys in the stack.  
It will be 4 if there are four 
Shy Guys stacked up.

If you have the Spin Hammer
ability, you can knock 'em
off one by one.

Obviously, their attack power
decreases when there are fewer
of 'em in the stack.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Stilt Guy.
Yes, as the name suggests, 
Stilt Guys are Shy Guys on
Stilts.

I mean, it seems pretty obvious
to me...

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

If you attack 'em by shaking
the ground, they'll fall off
their stilts and become
normal Shy Guys.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Hurt Plant.
Hurt Plants pretend to be 
Heart Plants, which give you
a Heart when you touch them.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

If a Hurt Plant bites you,
you'll be poisoned.
Then your HP will slowly
fall with each turn.

We'd better beat 'em as quickly
as possible.

Unless you can frequently
restore your HP, you'll find
yourself in trouble pretty fast.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is an M. Bush.
M. Bushes pretend to be bushes
and wait for unwary prey. 

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

Their bites are sometimes
poisonous, so be careful.

If you get poisoned, your HP
will gradually fall.

Your situation could become
critical unless you restore
your HP as soon as possible.

Let's clear 'em out quickly,
OK? Use your most powerful
attack, why don't you?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Jungle Fuzzy.

Jungle Fuzzies are very similar
to other Fuzzies, but they live
in the jungle, so...
...that's their name.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

They cling to you, suck out
your HP and add it to their own.
What a sleazy move!

They won't stop clinging to you
unless you tear 'em off
with the action command.

They also occasionally divide,
so let's beat 'em before they
get the chance.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Spear Guy.
Spear Guys are relatives of
Shy Guys. They live in the
jungle.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

You'll get hurt if you attack
with the Hammer while they're
pointing the spear at you.

You'll also get hurt if you
try to jump on 'em when the
spear's pointing upward.

Pay attention to the position
of their spears when we attack.

Oh yeah, they also sometimes
call in reinforcements.
After they throw their spears,
they become ordinary Shy Guys.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Putrid Piranha.

Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

Putrid Piranhas sometimes bite,
but the truly scary thing is
their nasty, poisonous breath.

The power of their bad breath
is 2, but your HP will begin
to fall if you get poisoned.

You should try to recover as
quickly as possible if you
get poisoned.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Lava Bubble, a fire
ball monster.
Lava Bubbles live near lava.

Max HP: 9, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

They are obviously pretty hot,
so you'll get hurt if you try
to jump on 'em.

They sometimes attack your
friends (like me!), too.
The power of that attack is 2.

Because of their fiery nature,
they fear snow and water.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Spike Top.
Spike Tops have spikes on top.
Duh!

Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 4

They're tough, just like Buzzy
Beetles, and fire attacks
don't affect 'em at all.

But their defense power drops
if you can flip 'em over.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Lava Piranha.
Lava Piranhas are plants that
can somehow survive in lava.

Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0

They blow out huge balls of
fire to attack.

That is one big flower! Wow!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Lava Piranha.
Lava Piranhas are plants that
can somehow survive in lava.

Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0

Since their bodies are on fire,
you'll take damage if you step
on 'em.
Don't worry if you're fireproof.

They'll try to burn you with
their fire breath.

They're creatures born of fire,
so water attacks will work
extremely well against them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Lava Bud.

Lava Buds are little flowers
branching out from the main
stem of the Lava Piranha.
They love it in the lava.

Hey, if you were a fiery plant,
you'd love it in there, too.

Max HP: 8, Defense Power: 0

They blow small seeds or
other projectiles to attack.
The small Lava Buds'
attack power is 4.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Lava Bud.

Lava Buds are little flowers
branching out from the main
stem of the Lava Piranha.
They love it in the lava.

Hey, if you were a fiery plant,
you'd love it in there, too.

Max HP: 8, Defense Power: 0

They blow out Petit Piranhas.
The Lava Buds' stems
themselves won't attack you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Petit Piranha.
Petit Piranhas spew from
Lava Buds.

Max HP: 1, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 0

These things can do some
serious damage, so watch it!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Jr. Troopa!
He swam all the way after us!
This kid...he's got guts!

Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 1

He still flies but now he has
a spike on his head. It'll hurt
if you jump on him.
He seems tougher this time...

Luckily for us, he also looks
pretty tuckered out.

Well, he should be tired.
The little guy swam to
Lavalava Island and back!

It seems better to attack
from a distance with an item
or something, rather than
attacking him directly.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Lakitu.
Lakitus are strange Koopas
that can ride clouds.

Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

They toss down Spiny Eggs,
and these sometimes turn
into crawling Spinies.

We'd better deal with them
quickly or else we'll be
surrounded by Spinies.

It seems like these Lakitus
have been hassling you for
your entire career, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Spiny.
Spinies have spikes on their
shells that are pretty sharp.

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 3

They'll roll into Spiny Eggs
and slam into you.

It'll be much easier to fight
them if you can flip them over.
Their defense power falls to 0.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Bzzap!
Bzzaps! are monstrous bees.

Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 0

If they sting you, sometimes
you'll be poisoned.

They also occasionally call a
swarm of small bees to attack
you in a cloud.

Be careful of those little
attackers, because you'll
sometimes shrink when stung. 

They don't have a lot of HP,
so take care of 'em as quick
as you can.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Crazee Dayzee.
Crazee Dayzees look cute, but
you won't think they're so
cute after they attack you!

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

They attack by singing a song.
If you fall under the song's
spell, you'll fall asleep.

If you get their HP low enough,
they'll try to run away. Beat
'em quickly so they can't flee.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is an Amazy Dayzee.
Amazy Dayzees are so rare that
they're also called the 
Legendary Crazee Dayzees. 

Max HP: 20, Attack Power: 20,
Defense Power: 1

These guys almost always flee
at their first chance.

It would be nice to beat one,
but be careful! Their attacks
pack a powerful punch!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Monty Mole.
You remember Monty Moles from
Mt. Rugged, don't you?

Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0
They're vicious rock-throwers.

They may look intimidating
but they're not very strong.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He said his name is Spike.
He seems to be a Lakitu, but
he's the weirdest one I've seen.

Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0
He throws Spiny Eggs.

Is it just me, or did he call 
himself Spike, Michael and
Lakilester? What an odd guy...

...I have to wonder just what
his real name is...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Ruff Puff.
Ruff Puffs are nasty little
cloud henchmen of Huff N. Puff.

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

Ruff Puffs float in the air,
so a Jump attack or something
similar may be best.

Of course, I'd be more than
happy to give 'em a Headbonk!

It's your call, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Huff N. Puff.
He's a giant cloud monster.

Max HP: 60, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0

His thunder attack is very
dangerous. If you don't defend,
you'll take massive damage.

When you attack Huff N. Puff,
little clouds called Tuff Puffs
come out. Their number is based
on the amount of damage you do.

If you leave the Tuff Puffs,
Huff N. Puff will swallow
them up and restore his HP.

You need to use smart tactics
to beat this guy, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These are the Tuff Puffs that
break off when you damage
Huff N. Puff.

Max HP: 1, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Tuff Puffs will fly over and
attack you directly.

You have to shake them off you
using the action command or
they'll keep on damaging you.

Huff N. Puff will swallow
the Tuff Puffs to restore
his HP, so think carefully
when attacking.

You can beat the Tuff Puffs
easily by attacking all enemies.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Jr. Troopa!
I'm stunned! Really!
This guy just will not quit!

Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 8,
Defense Power: 1

He's obviously been training.
It seems he can use magic now.

Sigh... Let's get this over with.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Gulpit.
Whoa! Gulpits look pretty 
burly, don't they?

Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Gulpits attack by picking rocks
up in their mouths and then
spitting 'em back out.

The bigger the rock they spit,
the more damage you'll take.

Big rocks take 7 HP in damage,
and small ones take 5 HP.

They can't do much damage
without ammo, so you should
concentrate on the rocks first.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These are Gulpits' Rocks. Gulpits
gulp them and then spit 'em at
people.
There are two sizes of rocks.

The big rocks do more damage
than the small rocks do. 
...Big surprise, huh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This monster... Even I don't
know what it is!

I don't know why, but it looks
really terrifying.
...I get the funny feeling I
had a nightmare about it...

Max HP: 20, Defense Power: 0

I don't know its attack power,
but it must be very powerful,
judging by its looks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Frost Piranha.
Frost Piranhas are frozen
Piranha Plants.

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

They'll try to freeze you with
their icy breath.

You'll be at their mercy if
they freeze you, so you'd
better try to immobilize them
right away.

Ice attacks won't work--
they love ice!
Fire attacks, though...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a White Clubba. They
live in cold climates.
Who knows why they moved here...

Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0

They sometimes attack
consecutively.

They're pretty powerful. It's
tough to swing such big clubs!

Ice attacks won't work on them,
so break out fire if you have it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Duplighost.
Duplighosts disguise themselves
as members of our party.

Max HP: 15, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

They love to attack in disguise.

It seems like they're generally
stronger fighters when they're
not disguised, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as Watt.
Max HP: 15

Its disguise is pretty much
perfect. Its attack power
is exactly the same as the
character it's imitating.

You know how Watt is shocking?
Same goes for this Duplighost.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as Kooper.
Max HP: 15

This imposter almost looks
better than the original! Ha!

Its disguise is pretty much
perfect. Its attack power
is exactly the same as the
character it's imitating.

It's probably not very difficult
for this Duplighost to disguise
itself as Kooper. After all, our
pal is pretty unusual looking.

It'll attack us with its shell,
just like the regular Kooper.

You'll have the best luck
beating it if you flip it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as me.
Max HP: 15
It'll do Headbonk and Tattle.

That looks nothing like me.
Does it? No!
Seriously, though, does it?
Mario? Hello?

Look, I've been working out
like crazy trying to get in
shape for adventuring. There's
just no way I'm that pudgy!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as Sushie.
Max HP: 15

Its face looks even grouchier
than the real thing!

Its disguise is pretty much
perfect. Its attack power
is exactly the same as Sushie's.

I'm glad we have Sushie on our
side. She's intimidating!
I wonder if this imposter is
meddlesome as well...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as Lakilester.
Max HP: 15
It's hard to take him seriously.

Its disguise is pretty much
perfect. Its attack power
is exactly the same as 
Lakilester's.

It's tough to dodge his
Spiny Flip, so pay attention.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as Parakarry.
Max HP: 15

He looks even more intelligent
as an enemy.

Its disguise is pretty much
perfect. Its attack power
is exactly the same as 
Parakarry's.

Don't underestimate him, Mario.
He looks pretty serious.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as Bombette.
Max HP: 15

Its disguise is pretty much
perfect. Its attack power 
is exactly the same as
Bombette's.

You should be careful even
though she looks cute.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Duplighost disguised
as Bow.
Max HP: 15

Its disguise is pretty much
perfect. Its attack power
is exactly the same as Bow's.

Look, you've seen her in action.
Do you really want to know what
a Smack attack feels like?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is an Albino Dino.
Albino Dinos are the guards
of this frosty place.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 4

Fire attacks won't work.

Their defense power is huge,
so let's reduce their HP
steadily using our strongest
damage-dealing attacks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Swoopula.
Swoopulas attack from the air
and cling to you to suck your HP.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Hit {A} repeatedly to fight
it off or else it'll keep
sucking your HP.

You can't jump high enough
to attack them while they're
hanging from the ceiling.

An earthquake attack ought
to work, though.

Flying party members, like
Bow or Parakarry, can also
attack them with ease.

If they fall and begin to flap
around, you can attack them by
jumping as well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is the Crystal King.
He's one of Bowser's main guys.
I don't know how he managed
to take over this palace, but...

Max HP: 70, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 2

He'll attack you by summoning
and launching Crystal Bits.

The power of each attack is 4.
The number of times he
attacks equals the number of
Crystal Bits he's deployed.

He'll also try to freeze you
whenever he can.

When his HP gets low, he may
try to divide and conquer.
The power of this attack is 8.

You can hurt him only by
attacking his real body.

If you don't know which one's
the main body, you should
attack all of them.
Pretty brilliant, eh?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I think this is a deceptive
duplicate of the Crystal King.

Since it's just an illusion,
all of your attacks will just
go through it.

Max HP: 70, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0
Just a reminder, Mario...

You must damage the real one.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Crystal Bit.
Basically, Crystal Bits are
just pieces of the Crystal King.
You can drop 'em with ease.

Their Max HP is 1 and they're
only dangerous when the
Crystal King spews 'em out.

Their defense power is 0.
These guys are pretty weak.

They'll keep coming, though,
until you've finally beaten
the Crystal King.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is an Ember.
Embers are fiery monsters
forged from uncanny blue fire.

Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

They may look frosty, but
they're actually on fire, so
fire attacks won't work.

They divide themselves when
they're attacked.
Keep attacking 'em, though.
You'll get 'em eventually.

They'll probably fight back.
Their attacks usually deal out
3 damage points.

Water attacks will work well.
Let's beat 'em before they
get a chance to burn us.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Dry Bones.
Dry Bones are skeletal remains
from Koopa Troopas.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 2

Just when you think they're
beat, these guys rise back up
and attack again!

You're going to have to beat
them all at once.

Or you could use fire attacks.
If they become ashes, there's
no way they'll recover.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's a Bony Beetle.
They're bony Buzzy Beetles.
...Hence the name.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 4
It's tough to damage 'em.

When their spikes are out,
their attack power is 5.

When they retract their spikes,
take the opportunity to flip
'em over. After that, beating
'em will be a breeze.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Magikoopa.
Magikoopas are the elite
magicians of the Koopa clan.

Max HP: 11, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 0

Tread carefully, Mario!
Their magical attacks pack a
serious punch!

They know many nasty spells.

We'd better beat them before
they can do anything crazy.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a deceptive duplicate 
of a Magikoopa.
There's no use attacking 'em.

The real Magikoopa's power is:
Max HP: 11, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 0
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Magikoopa.

The real Magikoopa's power is:
Max HP: 11, Attack Power: 6,

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Koopatrol.
They're elite Koopa soldiers. 
These are the highest-ranked
guards of Bowser's Castle.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 3

In case you hadn't noticed,
they're fitted with spikes.
Don't jump on 'em.

When their HP drops low,
they'll charge up power for
one last-ditch attack.

The power of this desperate
attack is 10.

They've also been known to
call in reinforcements when
they're in trouble.

Don't underestimate these
nasty Koopas, Mario.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
These are the Hammer Bros.
You've seen these punks
before, haven't you?

Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 1

Be careful of that hammer!
If it hits you, you'll get
shrunk in a wink.

When the Hammer Bros. get
desperate, they'll hurl a ton
of hammers, so watch it.

These guys have been a pain for
ages, so let's give 'em an 
old-fashioned whopping. 

As always, they're not to be
underestimated.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Bombshell Bill.

Bombshell Bills have such
beautiful gold casings!
Of course, if you sit and
admire 'em, you'll get hit.

Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 0

Pay attention to their HP,
because their explosions get
bigger as their HP drops.

Let's take 'em out before
they get near us!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a B. Bill Blaster.
B. Bill Blasters shoot a
constant stream of
Bombshell Bills.

Max HP: 10, Defense Power: 4
They won't attack you directly.

They're pretty resilient.

You have to keep attacking 'em,
though, otherwise the air will
be filled with Bombshell Bills.
And nobody wants that.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Jr. Troopa again! My man!
The little guy still has some
egg shell left on his body! Aww!

Max HP: 60, Attack Power: 8,
Defense Power: 2

Whoa! He's been working out!
He looks as though he may be
able to change his shape, too.

You've got to love this guy's
effort, Mario. To follow us all
the way here? What dedication!

Come to think of it, how do
you think he got here, anyway?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the Evil King Bowser!
Finally, after all this time!

Max HP: 50, Defense Power: 1

He has a huge arsenal of
attacks, from blowing clouds
of fire to jumping on us.

Fire Attack: 8,
Stamp Attack/Nail Attack: 6

I'm sure he has other attacks
that I don't know.
Boy, does he look nasty!

He's strong enough as it is,
but I'm sure he can use that
Star Rod to increase his power
until he's nearly invincible.

Princess Peach needs us!
Let's take him, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the Evil King Bowser!
Uh... I think he got bigger.
That's not a good sign...

Max HP: 99, Defense Power: 2

He has a huge arsenal of
attacks, from blowing clouds
of fire to jumping on us.

Fire Attack: 10,
Stamp Attack/Nail Attack: 8

I'm sure he has other attacks
that I don't know.

Kammy Koopa's mysterious
device has somehow beefed up
his power even more.
That's hardly fair!

You should use that Star Beam
whenever he uses the Star Rod
to increase his power.
Oh, you already knew that?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's the Evil King Bowser!
No more messing around!

Max HP: 99, Defense Power: 2

He has a huge arsenal of
attacks, from blowing clouds
of fire to jumping on us.

Fire Attack: 10,
Stamp Attack/Nail Attack: 8

I'm sure he has other attacks
that I don't know.

When he increases his power
with the Star Rod, our attacks
will be totally useless.

When that happens, you must
use our ultimate weapon, the
Peach Beam! It has the power
of everyone's wishes!

This is our time, Mario!
Let's take this chump!
We're coming, Princess!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Kent C. Koopa.
He seems pretty greedy for
such a large Koopa.

Max HP: 70, Attack Power: 10,
Defense Power: 6

He sometimes does a stamp
attack with his shell.
That attack has a power of 3.

His shell attack also damages
party members (like me!), 
so be sure to defend!

As with all Koopas, your
chances will greatly improve
if you can flip him over.
His defense power will drop.

Watch it, though! He'll attack
as soon as he's back on his feet.

And by the way, is he not 
THE HUGEST KOOPA EVER!?!
Somebody told me that he used
to live in Koopa Village...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Blooper.
Bloopers lurk in the dank
pools of Toad Town Tunnels.

Max HP: 30, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

They seem pretty unremarkable.

Although...
You have to wonder how they
float in the air like that...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is an Electro Blooper.
Electro Bloopers are
electro-charged.

Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 4,
Defense Power: 0

A bit of advice: When they're
emitting electricity, it'd
be a smart move to avoid
contact with 'em.

If you can manage to damage
'em while they're emitting
electricity, they'll go back
to normal.

Their attack power when they're
emitting electricity is 6. 
Let's try to be careful,
what do you say?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Super Blooper.
Whoa! It's huge!
Easily the biggest Blooper ever!

Max HP: 70, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0

Trust me, its size doesn't lie.
It's pretty powerful.
When it gets mad, it turns red
and its power goes way up.

And sometimes it spawns
Blooper Babies.
Buckle down, Mario!
We're in for a fight!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Blooper Baby.
Super Blooper spits 'em out
and they come to drain you.

Max HP: 6, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

We need to beat 'em quickly so
they can't drain us dry.
They're so cute, though! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is The Master.
He owns the Dojo--
and he's the strongest member.

Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 6,
Defense Power: 0

If he's the best in the Dojo,
he must be pretty tough!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is The Master.
He owns the Dojo--
and he's the strongest member.

Max HP: 75, Attack Power: 8,
Defense Power: 0

He knows both normal and
advanced methods of attack.

You'd better concentrate,
Mario! This guy doesn't mess
around at all!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
He is The Master.
He owns the Dojo-- 
and he's the strongest member.

Max HP: 99, Attack Power: 10,
Defense Power: 1

He may well know a few moves
I've never heard of...

We can't expect mercy from
this guy, so let's take the
fight to him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Chan, of the Dojo.
He's training under The Master
and is happy to fight us.

Max HP: 15, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 2

Hammer attacks don't work well,
but you can turn him over with
Jump attacks. Once he's flipped
over, he's easy.

No mercy, Mario!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Lee, of the Dojo.
He's training under The Master
and is happy to fight us.

Max HP: 20, Attack Power: 5,
Defense Power: 0

He has mastered the art of
disguise, so don't let it
faze you when he suddenly
mirrors us.

Remember, he can't stay
disguised forever.

Don't let his strange tactics
throw you off guard, no matter
how many times he transforms.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Gloomba.
Gloombas are nasty Goombas who
live in the Toad Town Tunnels.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

They're stronger than ordinary
Goombas, but you can take 'em.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Paragloomba.
Paragloombas are nasty winged
Gloombas who make their home
in the Toad Town Tunnels.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,
Defense Power: 0

Just like Paragoombas, 
Paragloombas lose their wings
when attacked, then they fall 
and become Gloombas.  
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Spiked Gloomba.
They're Spiked Goombas who live
in the Toad Town Tunnels.

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

Be careful of the spiked hats
they wear.
It'll definitely hurt if you
jump on 'em.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Dark Koopa.

Dark Koopas are Koopa Troopas
who live in the Toad Town
Tunnels. They're known for
causing dizziness.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 2

Be extra careful when you see
'em grin, because that means
they're getting ready to do
their dizzy attack.

Their defense power is 0 
when they're turned over, so
you should use Jump attacks.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a D. Paratroopa.
D. Paratroopas are Para-
troopas who live in the
Toad Town Tunnels.

Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 2

Hammer attacks won't work
because they're airborne.

They'll lose their wings if
you jump on 'em.

They'll become Dark Koopas
when they fall, but be careful!
They'll do a dizzy attack
once they're grounded.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is a Red Magikoopa.
He's one of the magicians in
the Koopa clan.
Snappy red robes, huh?

Max HP: 11, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

He can magically increase the
attack power of others.
Take care of him before he can
pump up his companions!

I have to admit, I like those

He looks pretty surly.

Yellow is the new black,
didn't you know?

Max HP: 11, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

He can use magic to give his
companions an electric charge.

While his cohorts are 
electrified, don't attack
them directly or you'll be in 
for a shocking surprise.

Those gray robes aren't very
flashy, but they're kind of cool.

Max HP: 11, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

He can use magic to make his
companions transparent.

We can't attack enemies
that are transparent.

Let's try to beat 'em before
that becomes an issue, what
do you say?

White robes, huh? How does
he keep 'em clean?

Max HP: 11, Attack Power: 3,
Defense Power: 0

He's a healer. When he 
magically heals one companion
it recovers 5 HP,

and when he heals all of his
companions at once, they all
recover 3 HP.

You'd better take care of this
guy but fast.

This is Lee disguised as Watt.
His Max HP is 20, so you should
be serious even though he looks
as adorable as Watt.

Lee has disguised himself as
Watt perfectly, so his
attack power is the same as
Watt's usual power.

Remember, don't stomp on him!
You'll get a massive electric
charge if you do.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
This is Lee disguised as Kooper.
His Max HP is 20.

Lee has disguised himself as
Kooper perfectly, so his 
attack power is the same as
Kooper's usual power.

Just like Kooper, he attacks
with his shell.
If you flip him over, you'll beat
him with ease.

Incidentally, Lee's red scarf
and wristband look cooler
than Kooper's.

...Don't tell Kooper I said
that, though.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
It's Lee disguised as me.
His Max HP is 20.

Do I really look like that?
No way...

He'll use Headbonk and Tattle.
He has the same skills as me.

Of course, I'm much better
looking and more debonair.

Sushie looks tough! Think she'd
be mad if she heard that?

he's the most intimidating
one on our team!

The "Invincible" Tubba Blubba
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Trials in the Toy Box

Hot Hot Times on Lavalava Island
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dark Days in Flower Fields
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Star Spirit on Ice
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Star-Powered Showdown! 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
And so Mario and friends
beat the Koopa Bros. at
their fortress and rescued
the first Star Spirit.

Still, six Star Spirits
remain imprisoned, and
they must save them as
quickly as they can.

The future of the
Mushroom Kingdom, Star
Haven and, of course,
Princess Peach...

lies in the hands of
Mario...
and his new friends.

Their adventure has just
begun.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Thus Mario and party
unearthed the legendary
Dry Dry Ruins deep within
Dry Dry Desert.

They smashed Tutankoopa
the Wizard and freed
Mamar, the second of the
wish-granting Star Spirits.

But the enemies awaiting
Mario grow ever stronger...
and the challenges 
more difficult.

What's in store for
Mario and friends...
Where will their adventure
take them next?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
After solving the secret of
"Invincible" Tubba Blubba,
Mario and party set free
Star Spirit Skolar.

Now, with Tubba Blubba
just a bad dream, the Boos
are free to haunt to their
hearts' content. 

Even the lonely wind
echoing through Gusty
Gulch seems to be
celebrating the victory...

at least for now.

With newest party member,
Bow, in tow, Mario and
friends are ready to take
on their next challenge.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
To save the fourth Star
Spirit, Muskular, Mario
and team disbanded the
gang of Shy Guys toughs.

Slowly, it seems as if the
life force is returning to
the once bleak night sky...

But the stars won't
truly shine until the
Star Rod is wrested from
Bowser's evil grasp.

Three Star Spirits
still await rescue.
Where in the world are
they being held?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Venturing deep into the
steamimg Mt. Lavalava,
Mario and friends plucked
the Lava Piranha...

and rescued the fifth
Star Spirit, Misstar,
from a fiery fate.

But the "treasure"
Kolorado is looking for
is yet to be found.
Wherever could it be?

What's that...?
Something...strange...is
going on around here...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
So it is that Mario and
party defeat cruel cloud
Huff N. Puff and set free
the sixth Star Spirit.

The thick clouds that once
cast dark shadows have
gone, and Flower Fields is
bathed in sunshine again.

A single Star Spirit waits
to be rescued, waits to
take its place in the
Star Sanctuary.

Perhaps you will see
Princess Peach soon...
Perhaps...
Just wait and see.

Kammy Koopa, who watches
impatiently from Bowser's
Castle, is waiting, too...

for you to try to save
them...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Mario has saved the last
Star Spirit, Kalmar,
from the Crystal Palace
at the edge of the world.

Now, with the seven Star
Spirits together, he has
the power to challenge 
Bowser...and the Star Rod.

At last, it is time for
Mario's showdown with
Evil King Bowser.

Can Mario rescue Princess
Peach and recover the 
Star Rod? Or will wishes 
forever go ungranted?

Dear Mario,
How do you do?
I'm Little T.
I'm just a little Toad.

I live in Toad Town.
I've been training at the Dojo
so I can save Princess Peach!

I'll write to you again later.
Bye!

Hello, Mario.
I'm Vanna T., Chuck Quizmo's
lovely assistant.

Thanks for participating in our
quiz show. Our ratings are
through the roof! Are those
Star Pieces helping you?

Please keep coming back until
you answer the last question!
I'll cheer you on!

Dear Mario,

Thank you so much for taking 
care of our Fuzzy problem.

We, the Koopa Troopas in the
village, really appreciate what
you've done for us.

We must apologize for not
rewarding you with anything.
We are but simple Koopas...

Please drop by the village
whenever you like.
Anytime. It'd be our honor.

Best of luck from all of us!

 Sincerely,
 Koopa Troopas at Koopa Village

Hey, wanderer! I have heard 
many stories about your deeds.
People speak very well of you.

It comforts me to know that
Bowser's creatures no longer
loot the ancient ruins.

Unfortunately, some relics are
missing. This is a shame.

I've heard that a Koopa was
wandering around the ruins...
That sounds very suspicious.

You should be careful if you
meet any suspicious types.

Anyway, I must go!
I look forward to hearing
great tales of your adventures!

How are you, dear boy?
I've just finished my exhausting
research of the ruins found by
my unwavering efforts.

Sadly, I did not find any
treasures as valuable as I had
hoped.

I will press on, though, old chap!
There are treasures hidden
all over the world!

I hear them calling my famous
name, asking me to dig them up!

To Mario,

Are you and Goombario doing OK?
I'm fine. Oh!
This is Goombaria, by the way.

Are you having an exciting
adventure?
Is Goombario being a hero?
Or is he just goofing off?

You know... I sometimes go
shopping in Toad Town with Mom.

Maybe we'll see you there.
I'd really like to hear some of
your exciting stories.
I can't wait! Really!

You can beat up Bowser--
I know it!♥

Hi there, Mario.
Are you eating regularly?
You know, breakfast is the most
important meal of the day!

The Cookbook you gave me really
comes in handy.♥

I already knew a lot of recipes,
but with this book, I can cook a
world of new dishes!

I want to tell you about the
latest dish I've been cooking.
It's unique!

It takes a Fire Flower and
an Egg to fix it. When I first
made it, it blew me away!

It might help you on your
adventures. Please come visit
and bring those ingredients!♥

Smashing, I trust. I'd just like
to thank you for helping with 
that nasty volcano business.

Of course, I'm sure you're well
aware of my own heroic role
in the final fracas.

I've lately worried about my
dear wife. How she must worry 
about me as I brave danger!

Perhaps it's time I returned
home for a while. Feel free to
stop by for a spot of tea!

How are you holding up?

It's so sunny in Flower Fields.
Peace has returned here.

Lily's in her own little world,
as usual.

Rosie is spreading a rumor that
you're interested in her.

I hear that Petunia is singing
your praises across the land.

As you know, I can't move from
this spot, but I'm content to
watch the Bub-ulbs frolic.

Good luck to you, Mario.

All of Flower Fields is wishing

I wish to the Stars that your

You were a lot stronger than
you looked. We figured you were
just some punk Goomba hanging
around with Mario.

Anyway, you proved yourself
to us. And you showed us that
being good is as important as
being strong. So...

When you come back, do you think
maybe we could be...friends?
Please say yes!

We'll be waiting!

Your mother dropped by for a

We had a really nice talk over

a touch disappointed that you
were still on the road.

She said that she's going to
cook a delicious dinner when
you come back, so you have
something to look forward to.

Oh yes! If you happen to see

Take care.

It's still a long time off,
but later this year we will be
staging an opening event for
a new Dry Dry Railroad route.

We feel the event would be a

Please return as quickly

I cannot shake the image of

It so worries me that I
can no longer sleep.

When you went with Mario, you
told me not to go with you...

But now I regret my obedience!
I should have gone anyway and
protected you from harm!

Now all I can do is wish to
the Stars with the other Boos
that you return safely.

Please take care.

Thank you for rescuing us from

We'd never dreamed we'd meet
a Boo of your stature!

The sight of you alone would
have been enough to keep us
going, but you went ahead and
defeated Tubba Blubba too!

We thought that our friends
were done for when they were
eaten, but they've all returned.

Many thanks! When you're done
with your quest, we're throwing
you a party. Please come!

Oh! And please say "Hi" to
everyone at Boo's Mansion!

Nobody would help us and we

Then we went to Toad Town and
heard about the Toy Box.

I was pretty sure you'd be OK
in there for a while, but...

who saved you! Come home soon!

Do that and I'll forgive you!

Once again, my brother went on
an exciting journey.

Once again, he went alone.
It's so unfair!

I remember the carefree days
when we played Golf and 
Tennis and had Parties.

I remodeled the house and
made a secret basement.
My brother has no idea!

It's the perfect place to 
write in you, my secret diary.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that a ghost appeared
in Toad Town today. It was big,
really big.

And it had red eyes, a giant,
gaping mouth and a mustache.


..........

Because you're my secret diary,
I'll tell the truth: Yaaaah!

I hate ghosts!! What will I do
if it appears at night!
Come back, Mario! I'm scared!

Yikes! I can feel something
behind me. Ahhh! I'm sure it's
there, but I can't look back!
No! No! Get away!

I think I'll be safe if I
don't freeze with fear. I'll
just shut my eyes and take
five steps back,

and then I'll jump and dash 
into bed. Here I go!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A Shy Guy appeared at my house
the other day. I found it asleep
in my bed! Can you believe it?

I ran after him, but he was way
too fast for me.

I heard that a lot of Shy Guys
also appeared in Toad Town.

Supposedly, they came from
Shy Guy's Toy Box.
It must be somewhere in town.

A Toy Box...
I wouldn't mind seeing that.
Maybe they have a Nintendo 64!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The whole Goomba family visited
me today.

They said that Goombario is in
the care of my brother, then
they gave me a souvenir!

It was a Goomnut, a special
treat from Goomba Village.

It looked so yummy I ate it
without telling my brother!
My FP increased by 3.

.........You think he'll notice?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that my brother went
to Lavalava Island on a tuna.

Unbelievable! So unfair!!
I... I... I wanna ride on
a tuna, too!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that some Yoshi kids on
Lavalava Island got lost and
my brother saved them.

I bet Yoshi kids are just about
the cutest things around.

I'm a bit jealous of my brother.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard a rumor that I actually
have lots of fans. Wow!

What great news! To live up to
their expectations, I want to
play the lead in an adventure!

Of course, my name would have 
to be in the title.
That'd be sweet...♥

But I know it'll never happen...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that a door appeared
in Toad Town. They say it leads
to Flower Fields.

I guess lots of Flower Spirits
live in that flowery place.

Flower Spirits... I bet their
souls are as beautiful as the
prettiest flowers...
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Somebody said to me that a
way will open when you use
a scarf and bucket... What?

A scarf for a snowman?
Wouldn't it melt him?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Yesterday, I got stuck in
the trapdoor when I was 
entering my secret room...

Have I been using it too much?
Or am I putting on weight?

I'd better oil it to make it
open easier.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When I looked up at the sky
tonight, I saw a shooting star
arcing across the sky toward
Princess Peach's Castle.

I made a wish to the Stars
right away, but I wonder if
it will really be granted...

What I wished was.............
..............................

I can't write it even though
this is a secret diary.

Aargh! You can see it even
though I erased it!

My wish is to sleep in the top
bunk bed.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I heard that my brother finally
saved Princess Peach!

Bowser increased his power with
the Star Rod, but my brilliant
brother beat him anyway!

I guess he'll be coming back home
pretty soon.

I'm looking forward to listening
to the story of his adventure.

Anyway, I'm going to finish this
diary for now.

I have to seal this room off
before he notices that I
remodeled without telling him.

Now I'm going to go prepare a
dinner to celebrate Mario's
return!

You must journey to Koopa Bros.
Fortress. You can travel there
by following Pleasant Path to
the east of town.

The path begins right next to
Toad's house.

If you have any problems getting
started, please don't hesitate
to ask for my help.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you stuck on the way
to Koopa Village. You try to
continue, but there is no bridge.

A tree grows near where the
path ends.
You smash this tree.

Something drops to aid you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see Koopas in trouble.
These must be the Koopas in
Koopa Village.

You are kind, and you help them
with their troubles.

One of the Koopas you help tells
you the location of the house
where the Koopa with the blue
shell lives.

Only that blue-shelled Koopa
can help you overcome the
difficulties that lie in wait on
the road ahead.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The four Koopa brothers are
holding a Star Spirit hostage.

They lurk in the stone fortress
at the end of Pleasant Path,
to the east of Toad Town.

It is a long journey east, even
from Koopa Village, and the road
is full of enemies.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The stone fortress is locked,
and it's guarded by Koopas.
You wander its depths, hunting
for a key.

A pink tomboy with an explosive
personality is locked in the
basement jail there.

You help her escape.
She ends up helping you, too.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The noble Star Spirit is
imprisoned on the top floor of
the stone fortress. 

Your blue-shelled Koopa and
explosive Bob-omb are the keys
to cutting the Koopa brothers
down to size.

You move with haste now.
The Star Spirit has many
important things to tell you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You go to the south of Toad Town
and find a station that is the
departure point to a far-off
land.

The red train at the station
cannot leave.  

Somehow, you destroy the
obstacle blocking the track.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You reach a mountain by train
but the crevasses there are
too difficult to cross.

A winged Koopa is fussing about,
waiting for help on the steep,
stony mountainside.

You help him out
and earn some help yourself.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you climbing over a
mountain in search of a desert.

Braving great dangers, you
cross the mountain and descend
to the mouth of an ocean of
sand.

Your true goal lies hidden within.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
At the end of the path in the
desert, there is a dusty town
where travelers rest.

It is there where you will find
some answers you seek.

When you leave the desert path,
you are quickly swallowed up by
the trackless desert.

For now, you stick to the path
and end up in the town.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you handing something
to a strange Nomadimouse that
resides in a desert town.

The Nomadimouse waits in the
back of the desert town,
hiding its face with a cloth.

To find that which you seek,
you give up something you have
already found.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The strange Nomadimouse I spoke
of...he does not tell you what
you want to know, even though
you've given him gifts?

Well, perhaps you have not given
him what he desires.

You go south as soon as you
leave the desert town and soon
you find a lush oasis.

A fruit ripening on the tree is
what you seek. You find it and
give it to the Nomadimouse.

For this treat, he breaks his
code of silence and gives you
the clue you need.
Beyond this, I can see nothing.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The one who knows the mystery
of the desert hides on top of
an old building.

A strange Nomadimouse at the
far end of town once waited by
a door. You check this door.
From there, you climb upward.

On the rooftops, you meet the
mysterious leader of the desert.
You find him over to the left
from where you climb up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you putting a bright,
flashing stone on a small rock
after wandering around the
desert.

Hmm...
Mmmmmmmmm...!

I cannot see exactly where it is,
but the flashing stone is pulsing
rapidly and there is just one
rock in the area.

Wait...something else...
It is on the opposite side of the
desert from the oasis.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you entering the ruins
that used to be buried deep in
the desert sand.

There are many surprises inside
the old buildings.

First you find a way to 
strengthen yourself, and then
you find three precious stones.

Deep inside, you set the stones
in the correct places on statues.

This is the correct way:

the Pyramid on the left,
the Diamond in the middle and
the Lunar on the right.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You go down the new stairs that
appear in the deepest depths of
the ruins.

You descend further, drawn by
the imprisoned Star Spirit
imprisoned below you.

A Koopa wrecks the ruins,
trying to destroy you.

You fight off this magic-wielding
menace and save the Star Spirit.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Deep inside a strange forest,
someone waits in the darkness
for you to arrive.

He floats through the air,
appearing and disappearing.
He shows you the way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In the dangerous gloom of
Forever Forest, I can see you
talking with a creature who lives
there.

You turn your back to the moving
bush and go into the depths of
the forest.
You find him waiting.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In the shadowy Forever Forest,
you must take the right path to
get out.

One path always looks different
from the others, and that path
is the one you always take.

You look carefully at the 
scenery to find your way. 

A wise member of your party
may well give you an important
hint.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When you escape Forever Forest,
you find a spooky mansion hidden
in the trees.

Someone who is waiting for your
help appears in front of the
mansion.

Inside, you gather some
important information.
You enter without fear.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you wandering in Boo's
mansion, trying to find the way 
to get upstairs.

At every turn, Boos play tricks
and set puzzles. You wisely
solve them all.

Now...I can see you standing 
with a record in your hand in
front of a phonograph.

You distract a Boo by playing
the record then quickly open the
treasure chest. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You climb onto the sofa on the
first floor of Boo's mansion.

You launch into the air and
pull down the chandelier, which
moves a glass case.

In order to enter the door
hidden by the glass case, 
you hang a heavy weight from
the chandelier.

Somewhere beyond the door, 
a powerful item awaits.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In Boo's Mansion in Forever
Forest, I can see a staircase
leading downstairs.

You go down to the storeroom
and through several doors.
In a back room, you challenge
Boos for a new pair of Boots.

You Spin Jump on the boarded
floor and break through, finding
a new path.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You return a Boo to his empty
picture frame, and he helps you
go upstairs.

When you enter the room
upstairs, you find a pair of
Boos waiting for you.

They tell you many things.
You realize that not all Boos are
troublemakers.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There's only one thing that has
the power to scare Boos.
I speak of a castle-dwelling
monster that can never be hurt.

There are many stories about
this immortal creature.
The Boos living on the windy hill
have heard them all.

You listen carefully to these
tales then bravely head for
the castle on the hill.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Although you enter the castle
on the windy hill, you are
stopped by a locked door.

You begin your search for the 
door key.

In a room containing a large
table, you open a small door and
see stairs going down.

Once you descend, you notice a
boarded piece of floor that you
can break. 

Down in the basement, you find
the key that you seek.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In the castle on the windy hill,
a much-needed key waits in the
room with the spiked floor.

With your Boo companion, you
run out onto the floor when
the spikes retract.

Before the spikes return, the
lady Boo helps you to turn
invisible. While invisible,
you are not hurt.

The key you find inside the
treasure chest helps you
continue your quest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In the castle on the windy hill,
you find a room off the main
corridor on the top floor. 

The key to the locked door is at
the end of this room.

You sneak through the room
without waking any guards and
claim the key.

You unlock the door and step
into the heart of the mystery.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you running away as
fast as you can.

You open the treasure chest
next to the bed where the
immortal monster is taking an
afternoon nap.

You find a magic talking key
inside the chest.

This key unlocks a tower with a
turning windmill.

The immortal monster keeps a
secret deep below it.

You run there as fast as you
can and teach him a lesson once
you learn his secret.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see a Star Spirit that
can't return to where it is
supposed to be.

Help it find its way back to
Star Haven and then come back
to Toad Town.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see mischievous folks
playing tricks and bothering the
citizens of Toad Town.

You walk west from the southern
shop and see these small people
entering and leaving the second
house from the shop.

They don't enter the house if
they see someone inside because
they're cowards.
You turn invisible to trick them.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You go into the house second
from the shop in the south of
Toad Town,

and find a hidden door that
leads to a Toy Box.

The mischievous thieves and all
of their stolen goods are inside
the box. You leap in after them.

Inside the Toy Box, you use
jack-in-the-boxes to move on.

The jack-in-the-boxes with
stars on their sides make you
go higher and farther. They help
you out mightily.

You find a key and return to
Toad Town.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The owner of the shop in the
south of Toad Town is sick with
worry about a stolen key.
You return it to him.

He offers you a reward, so you
take something that you noticed
was missing inside the Toy Box.  
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You get a train, but you don't
carry it into the Toy Box.
Instead, you put it in the box
from outside.

The train is a welcome addition
inside the Toy Box, and now you
are able to move on.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Building blocks and a fence
block your way in the Toy Box.

You have to make good use of
the jack-in-the-boxes and a
revolving wall to continue. 

When the revolving wall turns,
you slip through the opening.
Only perfect timing gets you
to the other side.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You have tracked down a
precious frying pan.

You give it back to a Toad Town
cook, who gives you something
useful in return.

You re-enter the Toy Box with
your new reward.
It will help you on your way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you standing beside
a huge Shy Guy who is too hungry
to move.  

You give him a fabulous Cake
made by a very talented cook.
He finds it so delicious that
he goes away.   

That talented cook makes the
Cake again when you give her
the Cake Mix.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You hit a dead end on the moving
walkways of the Toy Box.

Instead of trying to jump over,
you turn invisible and slip
through the net.

Soon enough you reach some
blocks that move up and down
but you cannot jump to your
goal.

You jump to a high spot near
the platform and hitch a ride
with a Paratroopa.

An illegible memo is the key to
continuing through the Toy Box.

You give the dictionary back
to the scholarly Toad.
With it, he is able to decipher
the Shy Guy's language.

He tells you the answer to a
puzzle. 

He says that you must smash
the four colorful boxes in a
certain order to open the way. 

If you remember the clue, 
you'll know the right order.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The path you choose might be
completely dark.

When you can't see a thing, it's
a good idea to take a different
path.

When you enter another dark
room, something carrying a light
appears.

You defeat this scary creature
and make a new friend.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You find the light that gleams
in darkness and discover a
glittering child in a lantern.

The way ahead is often dark,
and you cannot go forward 
without light.  

You save the sparkling child
imprisoned in the lantern.

When you break the lantern,
the child is freed.
This bright child often lights
up what is hidden.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
When you bring light to darkness,
Shy Guys flee from it. They are
running toward the thing that
you seek.

You follow them with the light.
A difficult test awaits you.
The Star Spirit can only hope
for your victory.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There is a strange island
floating by the port docks. 
You jump on it and smash down
to get a rise out of it.

Soon after, I can see you with
a light amid warm darkness.
...You do know where the port is,
don't you?

I suppose I'll tell you, just
in case. Go straight in the
direction opposite Forever
Forest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A journey to a faraway island
is your destiny. I can see you
crossing the sea with one who is
indebted to you.

I can also see a Star Spirit
waiting for you in the heart of a
volcano.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
On the jungle island to the
south, I can see an erupting
mountain. You must find a path
to this volcano.  

Ohhh...!
I can see Yoshis. Many Yoshis.

The Yoshis know something, so
you talk to them to learn 
the answers you seek.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The baby Yoshis are at a
mischievous age, and they
play hide-and-seek on the
jungle islands.  

You help the fish baby-sitter
when she loses them and asks
for help then you are helped,
as well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Yoshis' hiding places seem
impossible to reach.

You find them all by moving
bushes out of your way,
crossing the water, and hitting
the tree stumps.

Underground...on top of a tree...
behind a bush...on a distant
island...deep in the jungle...

...that's where all the baby
Yoshis are hiding.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you looking puzzled
in front of a big stone statue
in the depths of the jungle.

You talk to the chief of the
village, who is pleased to have
the children back safely.

As a reward for finding them,
he gives you something beautiful,
which is the key to your
continuing quest.

You put what you received on
the big stone statue in the 
depths of the jungle, then you
follow the path that appears.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In the deep, dark jungle,
you shake the bushes, plug the
geysers, and pull the vines to
move ever deeper. 

You reach the base of a gigantic
tree.

You see a black shadow perched
atop this huge tree.
It watches over the jungle...
and it is glad to help you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The giant jungle guardian helps
you by building a bridge.
You cross it.

Your destination is the erupting
volcano. Somebody is waiting 
for your help in the depths of
its superheated caves.

You ride across the molten lava
to enter the bubbling depths.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A flood of magma is blocking your
way. It's too wide to cross.

You climb to a nearby platform
and use blue blocks to slow down
the flow of lava.

A powerful item awaits you on
the other side.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Deep below the earth, you
hammer a line of blocks to dust. 
A spiked boulder opens a path.

You go deeper and sense that
a Star Spirit cries out just
ahead of you.

A massive fire flower stands
in your way.
Water beats fire, you know.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A treasure chest blows clear
from a violent eruption. 
It lands deep in the jungle.
It waits for you.

The chest has fallen to earth
near the spot where you met
your aquatic companion.

A treasure-hunting Koopa in
Yoshi's Village finds a magical
seed.

Why is that important?
The seed is vital to your quest!
You hand over your new-found
treasure and get this seed.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
There is a lot of empty space
in the Toad Town flower garden.
A door opens when enough
flowers bloom. You need seeds. 

You find the special seeds in
Toad Town, Forever Forest,
Jade Jungle and on Mt. Rugged.

Once you find seeds from four
different colored flowers, you
take them to a girl who tends
the Toad Town flowers.

You need all four seeds.

I can see a Star Spirit waiting
for you in the cloudy sky of a
different world. This world lies
just through the door.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You search for a Magical Bean
that grows a vine into the sky.

To the east of the big tree,
I can see a flower being
pestered by creatures who dwell
under the ground.

The annoyed flower really loves
seeds. You help her out.

Your reward is the precious
Magical Bean.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In order to grow the Magical
Bean in Flower Fields, you first
search for Fertile Soil.

You give a starving red flower
a Red Berry.

This tasty berry falls into your
hands when you smash the tree
near Petunia.

The red flower lets you through
its gate and you continue on
your way. Soon enough, you meet
another flower.

This flower is only too happy to
give you Fertile Soil.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you talking with a
flower at the bottom of the dry
spring in Flower Fields.

The waterless spring is beyond
the gate that the yellow flower
stands guard over.

You give the yellow flower a
Yellow Berry, and it repays you
by opening the gate.

By smashing the tree beyond the
red flower's gate, you find the
Yellow Berry you need.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The precious stone that the
flower of the spring seeks is
in the garden beyond a confusing
hedge maze.

The keeper of this garden has
many thorns but is very
beautiful. You hang on every
word she says. 

A sparkling berry from a crystal
tree is the only treasure
beautiful enough to match the
Water Stone.

You talk to Posie and she gives
you what you need.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You take the sparkling berry to
the rose in the flower garden.
She finds it irresistible and
trades the Water Stone for it.

When you put the stone in the
dry spring, water begins to flow
like magic.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you trying to clear
the air of clouds. You search
in vain for the sun, hurrying
beneath dark clouds.

The sun, trapped by the
menacing sky, cannot rise.
He tells you important news.

A cloud rider stops you as you
travel from your visit with the
sun. He will join you.

With his aid, you stomp on the
colored blocks in the correct
order: green, purple, red,
green, green, purple.

When you find the cloud-making
machine, you smash it to bits
and bring the bright sky back.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see you planting a magical vine
that you hope will grow higher
and higher until it pierces the
clouds.

When planting it, you do
everything in the right order.

First, you prepare the soil.
Next, you plant the seed.
Finally, you give it water.
Only the right order will do.

The Star Spirit is being held
in the clouds. You climb your
magic beanstalk up and up.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The Star Spirit is waiting for
you on a cloud in the sky.

You battle a giant cloud
monster, destroying the smaller
clouds as they appear.

The greatest danger comes from
powerful bolts of lightning.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You travel to a far-off land,
a frigid place covered with snow
and ice.

You find new strength in the
deepest place under Toad Town.

Using your new ability, you are
able to enter a new path.
A blue door on a high ledge
beckons, but you can't reach it.

There are several things
invisible to the naked eye near
the door.

With the help of your sparkling
companion, you see the way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you visiting the most
important penguin in a cold city.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You travel on the snowy path
to the west of Shiver City.
A glittering town lies in the
frosty valley.

It is here that you learn some
vital information and receive a
gift to help you on your way.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The cities in the frozen land
have been friends since times
long past, and each holds an
ancestral treasure.

You already hold one treasure,
and you receive the other from
the most powerful penguin
in the city.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see some snowmen in a row
in front of a cliff.

You add decorations to them
until they all look the same.
The way to the frozen heights
opens soon after.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You climb up a steep mountain
and break the cracked wall
beyond the stairs. You enter an
icy cave.

The room is filled with crystal
pillars, and your eyes deceive
you. You think for a moment that
it's a dead end.

You don't trust your eyes.
You keep moving forward.
You find something helpful once
you break the illusion.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Someone needs your help in the
Crystal Palace that perches
atop the mountain. 

You have received a gift.
You use it as a key and climb to
the mountain's top.

Once you've scaled the frozen
heights you spot the palace
you need to reach.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You think that you're looking
at your reflection in a mirror,
but no! Something mischievous is
imitating you.

You enter the blue door and walk
through the columns to reach the
other side of the glass.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
In the Crystal Palace, often
what you do on one side of the
glass affects what happens on 
the other side.

You break a boarded piece of
floor in the back, then go back
to a room in the front.

Where there once was a red X,
there is now a hole.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
You enter the red door and
beat the guards on the bridge.
Their statues disappear.

You place your explosive friend
by a red switch and go through
a revolving door.

You find a large stone statue
in a room. It doesn't budge even
when you push it. 

Your Koopa friend helps you hit
a switch in the reflection.
You cross the bridge and make
your way around to its twin.

Eventually you find a smaller
stone statue and push it aside.

You discover that the large
statue has moved as well.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see creatures that change
direction when you talk to them.

I also see identical stone
statues that you can move by
pushing them from the rear.

By talking to the creatures,
you get them to face the right
directions. You then push them
to cover the pads on the floor.

Once you solve the puzzle,
stairs appear that lead to
the door high up on the wall.

You continue into the palace.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
A frozen king rules in the
palace on the snowy mountain.

He seems to split into three
kings, but two of them are
phantoms. To be sure, you
attack all of them at once.

The last Star Spirit is freed
once you defeat him.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see the Star Spirits
gathering and waiting on
Shooting Star Summit.

They are waiting for you,
of course. You need only to walk
up there and a route to the sky
will be made clear.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The power of the Star Spirits
and the strength of your wishes
lead you to the castle.

The root of all this evil
misfortune awaits in the floating
castle in the sky.
You must fly there.

The way up leads from Star
Haven.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see a long corridor of 
flowing lava.

A speaking statue makes your
journey more difficult, but you
survive with your friends' help.

After cooling the lava flow, you
continue your journey to the top
of the castle. Your quest's end
awaits you on high.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see two rooms with high
ceilings. When you pull chains
in these rooms, water flows.
You use these to continue.

After climbing higher and higher,
you come to a room that seems
to be a dead end. 

You move a stony face of Bowser
to find the entrance.

In the first room, you push the
Bowser on the right. In the
second room, you push the
Bowser on the left.

In the third room, the Bowser
in the middle is already open,
but it is a fake.

You push it to the right.
The path opens for you.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Either your Koopa friend or
your explosive companion helps
you when you find a red switch.

A repeating series of high and
low paths confuses you.
The blue torches behind the wire
fence give you a clue. 

You go forward in the same
order as the torches: up, down,
down, up, down, up.

The princess is just beyond this
final puzzle.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I can see you fighting with
the evil king on the highest
ramparts of the castle.

The Power of the Star Spirits
helps you in your fight.

You never give in, even when
the battle looks dire.
The small star and the princess
give you all the help they can.

Do not delay, Mario...
You must win the final battle...
...to return hope to the world!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Mega Jump Badge.

You are ascending a frozen
mountainside, climbing icy stairs
to the Crystal Palace. 

At a flat platform, you continue
forward and find a red ? Block
floating in air.

You smash it and the Badge 
becomes yours.

I see...a Jump Charge Badge.

It is for sale at the open-air 
shop in the plaza outside the

pipe in Toad Town, then head

But beware! For I see a nasty
enemy protecting the chest.
You must defeat this dreaded
creature to reach the Badge.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Sleep Stomp Badge.

It is for sale at the open-air 
shop in the plaza outside the
castle gate.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Dizzy Stomp Badge.

Inside a volcano, close to where
a strong Hammer hides, the lava
flow has been slowed.

From there, you descend the
stairs to find a metal block 
in your way.

You smash the block with your
new Hammer and enter the room
beyond. There lies the Badge.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a D-Down Jump Badge.

In Tubba Blubba's Castle in
Gusty Gulch,

you enter the left door in the
foyer and go in the next door
you see.

The Badge lies on a big table
in the small room.

You can't reach it with the jump
pad! Instead, you blast into
the room above.

Inside the hidden room, you
smash through the floor and a
Paratroopa flies you over the
table.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Power Bounce Badge.

It lies inside a cage in the
Koopa Bros. Fortress.

You sneak through an opening
in the back to reach it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Power Smash Badge.

You enter the Private pipe in
Toad Town and head left, 
smashing blocks as you go.

You enter a pipe and continue
left once you emerge.

After breaking a block to make
a jump pad fall, you leap up to
the Badge's resting place.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Mega Smash Badge.

You see it on the road to the 
Sun Tower in Flower Fields.

You ascend the stairs then use
a friend to blast the rock.
The way to the Badge opens.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Smash Charge Badge.

It's high up in the fortress of
the Koopa Bros.

You climb the stairs that rise

the ramp.

A Bob-omb will try to keep you
from taking it.

from the ledge where you 
retrieved one of his letters. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Power Quake Badge.

You enter the jungle from

If he is outside, talk to him and
he'll help you further. 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Deep Focus Badge.  

It's near a big, beautiful 
treasure chest in Princess
Peach's Castle, way up in the

The Badge is lying in front of
a fallen chair near the chest.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Deep Focus Badge.  

It is in the Toy Box, in a room
with a Ferris wheel and many
platforms that move up and
down.

You smash an invisible block
between the two ? Blocks in
front of the 3 and 4 toy blocks
to find it.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Deep Focus Badge. 

It is outside Bowser's Castle,
near the outer wall. There is a
cliff you normally cannot reach,
but...   

You somehow cool off the lava 
stream so you can walk there. 
The Badge is in the red ? block.
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...an HP Plus Badge.  

In Forever Forest, you take the
path opposite the one where the
most toadstools are glowing
spookily.

You know you're in the right

honeycomb. You head for a 
clearing in the center.

A red ? Block is waiting for you
in the darkness.

I see...an HP Plus Badge.

Anyway, the child is my brother,
Merlow. He will trade Star Pieces
for Badges.

Head upstairs to see him!
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I see...a Happy Heart Badge. 

In the depths of the jungle, 
there is a tree atop which 
Raphael the Raven is said to
make his home.

A huge vine winds around it,

you'll find the Badge.
