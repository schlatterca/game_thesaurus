are. You knew that, right?
———————————————
Whenever you destroy those
creatures from the darkness, a
portal opens that looks like this
on the map: [portal].
You hear me? It's called a portal.
You'd better remember that!
———————————————
And...in those woods we came
through...
———————————————
Yes! It's got to be around there...
———————————————
Tell me... Do you ever feel a
strange sadness as dusk falls?
———————————————
They say it's the only time when
our world intersects with theirs...
———————————————
...The only time we can feel the
lingering regrets of spirits who
have left our world.
———————————————
That is why loneliness always
pervades the hour of twilight...
———————————————
But enough talk of sadness...
I have a favor to ask of you,
[Link].
———————————————
I was supposed to deliver
something to the royal family of
Hyrule the day after tomorrow...
———————————————
Yes, it was a task set to me by the
mayor, but...would you go in my
stead?
———————————————
You have...never been to Hyrule,
right?
———————————————
In the kingdom of Hyrule there is a
great castle, and around it is Castle
Town, a community far bigger than
our little village.
...And far bigger than Hyrule is the
rest of the world the gods created.


You should look upon it all with
your own eyes.
———————————————
It is getting late... We should head
back to the village. I will talk to the
mayor about this matter.
———————————————
Hey! [Link]! You there?
———————————————
Hey, you mind helpin' me herd the
goats?
———————————————
Don't you think you should leave
town for a while? I mean, at least
until the uproar settles? THEN you
could come back...
———————————————
With sword in hand, return to me...
———————————————
Demo 2:Meeting Ilia
(take [Link]'s horse to the spring)
———————————————
Oh, done herdin' for the day,
[Link]?


Well, nice work.
———————————————
The royal gift Rusl told you about is
ready, so you should get ready for
your trip to Hyrule Castle.

Now, the royal family requested
this gift specifically, so it's real
special.

It'd be...bad...if the representative
of Ordon were to be late for such
an occasion, you get me, lad?
———————————————
The path before you is a long one,
my sweet horse...but please bear 
[Link] safely along it.
———————————————
Wait... What's this?
———————————————
What's happened? She's injured,
isn't she?
———————————————
[Link]! How could you!
You were pushing [Epona]
too hard again! I bet you hurt her
leg jumping fences, didn't you!
———————————————
Now, now, Ilia. There's no need to
get so hot with him...
———————————————
FATHER!
———————————————
How can you be so easy on him?
You're the MAYOR! You should
start acting like one!
———————————————
You poor thing...
———————————————
It'll be all right, [Epona].
I'll take you to the forest spring
right now.

Once we soothe you in the spirit's
spring, you'll feel better in no
time!
———————————————
W-Wait! Ilia!!!



Why, without [Epona]...
The gift won't get delivered in time!
———————————————
Oh, this won't do...
———————————————
Demo 4 (First half):Enemy appears at spring
[Link] in the darkness
———————————————
I had no idea... I hadn't heard the
details about Talo's capture...


But, Colin...
———————————————
So you still prefer your master over
me, huh, [Epona]?
———————————————
Don't worry about your horse,
[Link].
———————————————
Fortunately, it looks like the injury
isn't too serious. You two can go
on together.
———————————————
But, [Link]...
———————————————
Can you at least promise me this?
———————————————
No matter what happens on your
journey, don't try to do anything...
out of your league. Please.
———————————————
Just come home safely.
———————————————
I... I knew you once...
———————————————
Yes... This feels so familiar...
The scent of hay...
———————————————
Long ago... When we were young,
you and I...
———————————————
You were always there... You were
always beside me...

———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
This gift was meant for you. It was
something I wanted to give you
before you left on your journey.
———————————————
Please, [Link], take it.
———————————————
You don't need to worry about me
any longer. Whenever you return...
I'll be waiting for you.
———————————————
You got the porcelain horse call!
———————————————
Wait...
———————————————
Come...to my spring... 
———————————————
You have...been transformed...
by the power...of shadow...
———————————————
Come...to me...
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
I found you!
———————————————
Oooh! Aren't you scary!
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! Are you sure you want to
be doing that? Snarling and glaring
at me?
———————————————
Well, that's too bad...
———————————————
I was planning on helping you...
if you were nice.
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! That's much better!
You humans are obedient to a fault,
aren't you?
———————————————
Oops! But you AREN'T a human
anymore, are you? You're a beast!
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
There, there. You be a good boy
and calm down. No need to bite!
———————————————
You look kind of surprised!
[sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
So! I bet you're wondering, where
exactly are we?!
———————————————
Well, I'll make you a deal. If you
can get over here, maybe I'll tell
you! [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Hmph! I guess you're not
completely stupid after all!
———————————————
Listen, I like you, so I think I'll get
you out of here.
———————————————
But in exchange for my help, you
have to do EXACTLY as I say!
———————————————
If you need anything from me, just
press [Z] to give me a sign!
———————————————
So, are we all clear? Good.
Now, come on! Get moving!
———————————————
This way! Over here!
———————————————
I'll be waiting for you, but you'll
have to help yourself for a change!
———————————————
...Midna?!
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! You remembered my
name? What an honor for me...
———————————————
So, this is the one for whom you
were searching...
———————————————
He's not exactly what I had in
mind, but...I guess he'll do.
———————————————
...You were imprisoned?
———————————————
I am sorry.
———————————————
Poor thing, he has no idea where
this is or what's happened...


So, don't you think you should
explain to him what you've managed
to do? You owe him that much...
———————————————
...Twilight Princess! [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Listen carefully...



This was once the land where the
power of the gods was said to
slumber. This was once the
kingdom of Hyrule.
But that blessed kingdom has been
transformed by the king that rules
the twilight...
———————————————
It has been turned into a world of
shadows, ruled by creatures who
shun the light.
———————————————
It is time for you to choose:
surrender or die.
———————————————
Oh yes, a question for all the land
and people of Hyrule...
———————————————
Life? Or death?!
———————————————
The kingdom succumbed to twilight,
but I remain its princess...
———————————————
I am Zelda.
———————————————
You don't have to look so sad!
———————————————
We actually find it to be quite
livable! I mean, is perpetual twilight
really all that bad?
———————————————
Midna... This is no time for levity.
The shadow beasts have been
searching far and wide for you.

Why is this?
———————————————
Why indeed? You tell me!
[sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Time has grown short. The guard
will soon make his rounds.
———————————————
You must leave here, quickly.
———————————————
Not that way! The guard's coming!
Boy, he's prompt!
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee hee! Well? Do you
understand where we are now?
———————————————
I guess a promise is a promise, so
I'll let you go back to where you
first tumbled into twilight...
———————————————
But...are you really sure you should
be going back?
———————————————
Are you sure you aren't forgetting
anything important?
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! Do you want to save
them?
———————————————
Well, in that case, little Midna
would be happy to help you!
———————————————
But...
———————————————
Well, you'd have to be my servant...
and like a servant, you'd have to do
exactly as I say!
———————————————
Why don't you go back, take a little
time, and give it some thought.
[sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Oh, that's right. I forgot to mention
one thing...


Though you may have left the
darkened realm, you haven't
transformed back to your former
self...and you won't anytime soon!
Now why could that be?
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee hee!



See you later!
———————————————
Beware... A shadow being...
It approaches...
———————————————
O brave youth...
———————————————
I am one of four light spirits that
protect Hyrule at the behest of the
gods. I am Ordona.
———————————————
The black beast you slayed was a
shadow being. It had come to seize
the power of light I wield.
———————————————
My brethren in Hyrule have already
had their light stolen by these
fell beasts.
———————————————
The entire kingdom has been
reduced to a netherworld ruled
by the cursed powers of darkness.
———————————————
The blight will not stop with Hyrule.
Before long, the entire world of
light will fall into the hands of the
king who rules the twilight.
———————————————
To save this land from the king of
twilight, the lost light must be
recovered.

The three light spirits who have
lost their light must be revived.
———————————————
There is but one who can revive
them and redeem this land...



You.
———————————————
Those transformed by twilight
usually cannot recover their
original forms...
———————————————
Unless... If you were to return to
Faron Woods where you were
first transformed... If you were to
revive the light spirit...
———————————————
There, by the power of the light
spirit, you may find the means to
regain your other state of being...
———————————————
Hmm! So these are the weapons
you use in your world?
———————————————
You really think this thing can slay
the creatures of twilight?
———————————————
That's not a bad bit of information
you heard, huh?
———————————————
Ugh... Look at that open window.
This village is full of idiots.
———————————————
So...
———————————————
Ohhh... How did it come to this?

The children... Please say
nothing's happened...
———————————————
Please forgive your good-for-
nothing father...

We should jump up there...but from
where?

Hey, there's someone over there,
too!

What could they be talking about?
I bet someone's worried about you!

But, [Link]...
Can you at least promise me this?
———————————————
To the hero...who was transformed
into a blue-eyed beast...in the
realm of shadows... In twilight...
———————————————
...This way...
———————————————
Just come home safely.
———————————————
Hey! What's going on?
———————————————
There should be one more... Where
could the last tear be?
———————————————
What?!
———————————————
There it is...
———————————————
What's going on? This is weird...
———————————————
Huh...
———————————————
What are they doing there?
———————————————
This is a pretty elaborate gate...
What are they trying to keep in?
...Or out?
———————————————
I bet it'll be worth our while to dig
in...
———————————————
...How about that?

scaffolding...

...Well, I won't use these, but I'll
hang on to them for you!
———————————————
All right, a promise is a promise...
I trust you enough to help.
———————————————
In exchange for my help, though,
I need you to gather some things
for me.
———————————————
Look, I can't tell you all the details
now, but it'll be easy, trust me...
———————————————
But enough about that. Do you hear
that noise? It's the lamentation of
the spirit that had its light stolen...
———————————————
Where in the world could it be?
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Better get going, don't you think?
Don't blame me for your world's
fate if you don't hurry up and find
that light!
———————————————
Come on! Snap to it!
———————————————
Welcome, Hero...
———————————————
Please receive the blessings of the 
fairies...
———————————————
If you ever have need of me, come to
this place.
———————————————
You have come to receive the blessings
of the fairies...but you haven't a
container..
———————————————
If you ever have need of me, come to
this place.
———————————————
Aww, but it was so nice here in the
twilight... What's so great about a
world of light, anyway?
———————————————
Eee hee hee! See you later!
———————————————
My name is Faron.
———————————————
I am one of the spirits of light who
dwell in Hyrule. By the order of the
gods, I protect this forest.
———————————————
O brave youth...
———————————————
In the land covered in twilight,
where people roam as spirits, you
were transformed into a blue-eyed
beast...
———————————————
That was a sign...
———————————————
It was a sign that the powers of the
chosen one rest within you...and
that they are awakening.
———————————————
Look at your awakened form...
———————————————
The green tunic that is your garb
once belonged to the ancient hero
chosen by the gods...
———————————————
His power is yours. His is the true
power that slept within you.
———————————————
Your name is [Link].
———————————————
You are the hero chosen by the
gods.
———————————————
Brave [Link]...
———————————————
A dark power rests in the temple
deep within these woods.
———————————————
It is a forbidden power. Long, long
ago, I and the other spirits of light
locked it away.
———————————————
Because of its nature, it is a power
that should never be touched by
any who dwell in the light.
———————————————
But this world weeps beneath a
mantle of shadows, and so there
is no choice... You must match the
power of the king of shadows.
———————————————
If you would seek this forbidden
power, then proceed to the temple
in the forest depths.
———————————————
Cripes! I don't see those black
brutes anywhere...
———————————————
They've gotta be hidin' somewhere,
waitin' for their helpless little prey
to come out! Then they'll FEAST!
———————————————
Shaman! I'm scared!
———————————————
We are safe as long as we remain in
here, child. Be at ease.
———————————————
Oh yeah? I wonder if the monsters
out there agree with you...
———————————————
They sure didn't seem impressed
by my bombs! How long do you
think we can hold this sanctuary
against beasts that strong, huh?
———————————————
Once they attack, it's OVER!
———————————————
Remember the lady from the
general store? Just one of those
things attacked her, and a whole
gang from town went to save her!
———————————————
And what happened? She was
already gone, and there were
TWO monsters waitin'!
———————————————
...You connectin' the dots? That
means that if we get attacked by
them, then we'll be...
———————————————
BARNES!
———————————————
Beth? Are you OK?
———————————————
Look, Renado... All I mean to say
is that it's risky here, too! Ain't
you got some place we can hide?
———————————————
There is...a cellar.
———————————————
WHAAT?! You've got a CELLAR?!
Where's the entrance, man?
———————————————
The entrance to the cellar is
designed to open when all of the
candles have been lit...
———————————————
Why didn't you say so sooner?
C'mon, now! Let's hide in there!
———————————————
...I...would not do that.
———————————————
When Father instructed me to
secure the cellar, I saw insects
like the beasts outside...
———————————————
Don't cry, Beth! It'll be OK!
———————————————
[Link] is coming to save
us all!
———————————————
...I can feel it!
———————————————
The tears you hold... They are blessed...
———————————————
Drink them and you shall better endure
the dangers that await you.
———————————————
Your power is a gift given only to
those with confidence to wield it.
———————————————
Huh? What is it?
———————————————
So... Where could that pitiful
light-stripped spirit be?

———————————————
Don't you think heading to the
temple deep within Faron Woods
sounds like a good idea?
———————————————
Aw, I was just starting to have fun!
Don't forget that Fused Shadow!
———————————————
Eee hee hee! See you later!
———————————————
My name is Eldin.



I am one of the light spirits of
Hyrule. I am the spirit that guards
these lands.

O great hero chosen by the gods...
———————————————
The dark power you seek lies in
the sacred grounds of the proud
mountain dwellers.
———————————————
But already those grounds have
been defiled, draped in shadow
and seeded with evil.
———————————————
You must go to those sacred
grounds and cleanse them.
———————————————
[Link]?!
———————————————
Ha ha ha! See, Beth?! I TOLD you
[Link] would save us!
———————————————
...You are the one from Ordon
whom these children spoke of?
———————————————
We are well met. I am Renado,
shaman of this town.
———————————————
And this...
———————————————
This is my daughter, Luda.
———————————————
The beasts took us and left us to
die...but Mr. Renado found us.
———————————————
At first, I couldn't believe they had
come from so distant a place as the
Ordona Province...
———————————————
Yeah, I... We don't remember much.
All of a sudden everyone was
captured, and then...until now...it's
been like...
———————————————
...A nightmare.
———————————————
Yeah! It was like a terrible dream
and we couldn't wake up...
———————————————
Mmm... Nightmares are everywhere
these days, it seems. This village
has certainly seen its share of
recent hardships...
———————————————
The dark beasts attacked, but even
worse was the sudden and
inexplicable change in the
mountain-dwelling Goron tribe.
———————————————
They had long been our friends,
but suddenly treated us as foes.
Even now they refuse to permit us
entry into their mines.
———————————————
It strains the limits of belief...
To think that such a gentle and
proud tribe could change so
suddenly...
———————————————
It makes me wonder if something
in those mines is the cause of this
change...
———————————————
In any case, you must take these
children and flee this village before
more nightmares descend.
———————————————
I, of course, cannot leave my village
in such a time. There is no telling
what may happen to us here...
———————————————
...But it is my job to try to coax the
Gorons back from their recent
change of heart.
———————————————
I mean, the thing I'm looking for is
there, so maybe you'll find your
friends there as well!
———————————————
Hey, remember that spirit... I bet
it has some good news for you!
———————————————
Go talk to her and get the good
word!
———————————————
What I'm looking for is supposed
to be in the temple deep in this
forest.
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
Is everyone...OK?
———————————————
...Good.
———————————————
Beth... I'm sorry. You know...for
shoving you. Are you mad?
———————————————
I... I think I finally understand.
———————————————
I understand what my dad meant
when he told me I needed to be
stronger, like you, [Link]...
———————————————
He wasn't talking about strength,
like lifting stuff. He was talking
about being brave...
———————————————
[Link]... You saved me,
didn't you?
———————————————
You... You can do anything.
———————————————
You can do something to help the
Gorons in the mine too, can't you,
[Link]?
———————————————
Heroic [Link]...
———————————————
North of here, across the plain and
past the great stone bridge, in the
lands guarded by the spirit
Lanayru...
———————————————
You shall find one who you seek...
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
Ilia...
———————————————
You've got to save Ilia!
———————————————
Those monsters left me with the
other kids, but they must have
taken her somewhere else!
———————————————
Whenever I thought I couldn't go
on, I would think of you and Ilia
and hold on, [Link]...
———————————————
See? I... I'm fine now.
———————————————
Remember what I told you back in
Ordon, [Link]?
———————————————
When I grow up, I'm going to be
just like you, [Link]!
———————————————
So you don't have to worry about
me anymore! Go help Ilia!
———————————————
Leave the children to me. I will
watch over them, I swear it.
———————————————
Do not let their fates trouble you.
Go to those who need you.
———————————————
In Hyrule, countless tales are told
of the ancient hero...and your
deeds bring them all to mind.
———————————————
May the graces of the great
goddesses who shaped Hyrule bear
you on your way.
———————————————
I really, REALLY need to get it, so 
keep your eyes peeled!
———————————————
There are two more Fused
Shadows... Let's get a move on and
find them both!
———————————————
Hurry! We need to head to the
Eldin Province to the east!
———————————————
[+]Alter pitch [A]Howl
———————————————
Something's happened...
———————————————
If you want to cross Kakariko
Gorge, we need to find something
to span it...
———————————————
We need to get back to Faron
Woods and look for something we
can use.
———————————————
Enough already. Quiet down and
look for the light spirit Eldin...
———————————————
You make sure to get that last
Fused Shadow, now!
———————————————
Eee hee! See you later!
———————————————
My name is Lanayru.
———————————————
Your efforts have at last restored
each of us light spirits in Hyrule.
———————————————
O hero chosen by the gods...
———————————————
The dark power that you seek...
———————————————
It waits in a temple set in the bed
of Lake Hylia.
———————————————
...But before seeking it, you must
now bear witness to something...
and never forget it.
———————————————
You must know that it was the will
of the goddesses that we lock away
the forbidden power...
———————————————
When all was chaos, the goddesses
descended and gave order and life
to the world.
———————————————
They granted power equally to all
who dwelt in the light, and then
returned to the heavens.
———————————————
The lands where the goddesses
descended came to be known as
the Sacred Realm.
———————————————
For ages, the people lived at ease,
content in mind and body...
———————————————
But soon, word of the Sacred Realm
spread through Hyrule, and a great
battle ensued...
———————————————
Among those living in the light,
interlopers who excelled at magic
appeared.
———————————————
Wielding powerful sorcery, they
tried to establish dominion over
the Sacred Realm.
———————————————
It was then that the goddesses
ordered us three light spirits to
intervene.
———————————————
We sealed away the great magic
those individuals had mastered.
———————————————
You know this magic...
———————————————
It is the dark power you seek...
the Fused Shadow.
———————————————
O hero chosen by the goddesses...
Beware...
———————————————
Those who do not know the danger
of wielding power will, before long,
be ruled by it.
———————————————
Never forget that...
———————————————
You have a bark, right? Then you
should also have a bite! ATTACK!
———————————————
If you don't help the spirit, we
won't have a chance of finding that
Fused Shadow.
———————————————
Hey, don't think for a second that I
care about your world of light...
I don't! I'm helping you because I
have to! You remember that!
———————————————
The dark power is in the sacred
land of the proud mountain people.
...At least, I THINK that's what the
spirit said.
———————————————
The place you need to go...
You know where that is, right?
———————————————
Hey... The light spirit is waiting 
for you.
———————————————
That is a Zora child! This is beyond
my expertise! Hmmmph!
———————————————
Doctor, wait! If something isn't
done, this child will...
———————————————
Well, this isn't good. A human
doctor won't do, huh...
———————————————
That old coot reminded me,
though... I've heard of a shaman in
Kakariko Village, in the Eldin lands,
who's tended Gorons and Zoras.
———————————————
Is that true? Perhaps if we take him
there...
———————————————
Inadvisable! Too dangerous!



But we can't turn a blind eye to a
pretty girl in need, either.


Yes, we'd better escort you!
Am I right, boys?!
———————————————
Well, isn't that nice.
———————————————
To reach Kakariko, we've got to
cross two plains that are each
infested by dangerous beasts.

But we'll be safe now!
———————————————
Cowards! Don't EVER show your
faces here again!
———————————————
Oh my!
———————————————
Looks like we've got one young
swordsman left!
———————————————
And not only that, but it looks like
this brave young man will escort us,
so get ready to go, honey. Pronto!
———————————————
You know that girl, don't you?
———————————————
It's a real shame... She can't even
remember her own name right now.
———————————————
Bless her heart...
———————————————
She found this poor boy collapsed
in the road, so she did all she
could to save him.
———————————————
More courage in that girl than in all
the soldiers of Hyrule, for sure!
———————————————
You lend your strength to her,
you hear me?
———————————————
So you say the bridge to the east
has been destroyed, huh? Then our
only option is to cross the bridge
to the west.
———————————————
You see what that means?
———————————————
You'll have to deal with that thing!
———————————————
Th-Thank you so much for this.
Um, if you don't mind me asking,
what's your name?
———————————————
...[Link]?!
———————————————
I will never in all my life forget your
kindness, [Link].
———————————————
Little lady, I think you'd best save
your thanks until we're safe in
Kakariko...
———————————————
This swordsman of ours has great
eyes, honey. They're proud and
wild...like a feral beast.
———————————————
We need a beast right now, to keep
the true ones at bay. If we make it
to Kakariko safely, we'll just thank
him then, OK?
———————————————
Hurry up and listen to what it has
to say!
———————————————
Sounds like a Fused Shadow is
somewhere up that mountain...
so all we can do is climb!
———————————————
I don't know what that Goron's
problem is, but you'd better come
up with a way to get up that
mountain...and quick!
———————————————
...WHAT?! What are you talking to
me for? You have to help that kid!
———————————————
Ugh... Look, hurry up so you can get
back to finding more Fused
Shadows for me!
———————————————
That HAS to be the treasure that
the spirits entrusted to the
Gorons...
———————————————
What in the world are you doing?!
Hurry up and find the Goron mines!
———————————————
The person you're looking for is in 
Lanayru Province, right? Well, good
for you.
———————————————
Head to the twilight that has fallen
north of Kakariko Village.
———————————————
The Fused Shadow should be there
too, so don't forget!
———————————————
Ugh! Where can that last Fused
Shadow be?
———————————————
...He has passed through the worst
of it. As long as he rests, he should
recover in due time.
———————————————
Do you know the fate of his
mother?
———————————————
Her welfare consumes him. He has
been mumbling deliriously about
her almost constantly...
———————————————
...I can see the knowledge grieves
you. It must be an awful memory.
———————————————
I'll stay with him until he's better!
No matter how long it takes!
———————————————
Is that so? Thank you, Colin.
———————————————
Hey, [Link], about Ilia...
———————————————
Is it true, what they said about
her?
———————————————
Yes, she has lost her memory,
Colin, and regaining it will be no
simple task.
———————————————
But it will be all right, child.
———————————————
You learned the [smell]!
———————————————
Forget the [smell] and
learn a new smell?
———————————————
[.]Yes 
[.]No
———————————————
But it won't fit in your wallet
now, so let's put it back.
———————————————
But it won't fit in your wallet
now, so let's put it back.
———————————————
But it won't fit in your wallet
now, so let's put it back.
———————————————
But it won't fit in your wallet
now, so let's put it back.
———————————————
Skills
———————————————
If we just give her some time, I am
certain that Ilia will find her heart
again.
———————————————
So, Colin, I'd like to ask you to
stay in this village until then.
It is our turn to show the courage
that you have already displayed.
———————————————
Nice to see there's still hope here.
And it's always good to see happy
results repay your efforts...
———————————————
Those skills of yours... Any chance
you're of the mind to put them to
use for Hyrule?
———————————————
What hope there is in our kingdom
is frail and dying...but there's still
a group trying to do what it can.
———————————————
And I'm a member of that group.
———————————————
Call me Telma.
———————————————
I may just stay here a bit longer.
I'm still worried about Ilia, and...
Well, never mind about the rest.
———————————————
[Link], I want to see you
again at my bar, you hear me?
———————————————
The bar is actually a kind of safe
house for my friends. There's a
passageway that leads to the castle
from in there, as well.
———————————————
If you ever need anything, stop by.
I'll be waiting for you, honey!
———————————————
...[Link]... H-Hurry...
———————————————
Hurry...to...Zelda...
———————————————
The Master Sword is deep within
Faron Woods, in the Sacred Grove.
———————————————
Get that sword and let's undo the
curse that Zant put on you!
———————————————
I don't even know where the Mirror of
Twilight is...
———————————————
But we might find a clue in the bustle
of Castle Town...
———————————————
The mirror shards lie in deep mountain
snows, within an ancient wood, and
somewhere in the sky...
———————————————
Hurry up and collect all the shards 
so we can return the mirror to its
original state!
———————————————
Wait... That should have revived the
spirit...
———————————————
...Oh no!
———————————————
Zant!
———————————————
Did you honestly mean to take an
ancient and withered power like
this and turn it against me?
———————————————
You are a foolish traitor, Midna.
———————————————
Why do you defy your king?
———————————————
I'll use my power to take you to 
the location of the open portal...
Pick where you want to go.
———————————————
When most people enter the
twilight, they can't come out this
easily. You'd better be grateful!
———————————————
You can't warp from this province
until you find a new portal!

———————————————
You can't right now... That guy's
watching us...
———————————————
What are you doing? Pick which 
one you want!
———————————————
No! This isn't the right place!
Get serious! Do it over!
———————————————
Hey! Are you doing that on
purpose to make me mad?!
———————————————
Are you trying to drive me crazy,
bringing me to a place like this?!
Give me a break!
———————————————
Looks like the path's impassable...
but I can get you up it if you want
to go.
———————————————
What do you want to do? I'll help
you if you want to go.
———————————————
Hey... Look...
———————————————
The Faron Woods that you know
so well... They're now covered in
twilight.
———————————————
You might not be able to come
back here, but... Do you still want
to go?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
It really doesn't matter to me
what you do...
———————————————
The only thing that'll happen if you
just stand here is the steady
spread of twilight... [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Want me to let you into the
twilight?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
You changed your mind?
———————————————
That won't work! Give it up!
———————————————
Did you hear me? You can't return
to the world of light that easily!
———————————————
...[Link]...
———————————————
If you want to go into twilight...
crawl under...the bridge...
———————————————
...I should tell you... You can enter
the Twilight Realm...even without
my help...
———————————————
I'm sorry...
———————————————
If you transform here, it would
scare someone! You don't want to
do that, do you?
———————————————
No! No! Someone will see you!
Transform where there's no one
around.
———————————————
Huh? What is it?
———————————————
[.]Warp
[.]Talk to Midna
———————————————
[.]Transform into wolf
[.]Warp
[.]Talk to Midna
———————————————
My KING? You, who do nothing
but abuse the magic of your tribe?
You must be joking!
———————————————
How dare you?! Are you implying
that my power is...our old magic?
———————————————
Now THAT is a joke!
———————————————
This power is granted to me by my
god! It is the magic of the King of
Twilight, and you WILL respect it!
———————————————
My Midna... Did you forget? That
beast is one of the light dwellers
who oppressed our people.
———————————————
No matter how much you may
desire otherwise, you will never be
more than a shadow in their world.
You cannot consort with their kind!
But if we can make their world
ours, Midna...light and darkness
will meet at last.
———————————————
Our tribe will take back their
realm...and sweet darkness will blot
out this harsh light!
———————————————
And that, Midna, is why...
———————————————
I need you.
———————————————
Not just for me, but for all of our
people... Lend me your power.
———————————————
So be it... I will return you to the
light world you covet!
———————————————
[Link], hero chosen by the
goddesses...
———————————————
Go to the princess locked away in
the castle.
———————————————
That princess holds the key that
can unlock you from your shadow
form...
———————————————
There are two mirror shards left!
There should be one hidden in an
ancient wood and another somewhere
in the sky.
———————————————
Hurry up and collect the last two
shards so we can return the mirror
to its original state!
———————————————
There's one more mirror shard to
find... Somehow, we have to get to
the sky...
———————————————
Doesn't someone know the spell 
that will restore power to the
Dominion Rod?
———————————————
All right! Up to the sky to find that 
last mirror shard!
———————————————
You've collected all the shards of
the Mirror of Twilight...
———————————————
Now, [Link], let's hurry!
To the Mirror Chamber!
———————————————
Zant is in the Twilight Realm!
———————————————
I want to help Zelda and the people
of Hyrule... I truly do.
———————————————
Midna!
———————————————
Please... Please tell me... How do
we break...the curse on this one?
———————————————
This...is the one... You need him...
to save your world!
———————————————
That's why... Princess... Please...
You must help [Link]...
———————————————
What binds him is a different magic
than what transformed him when he
first passed the curtain of twilight.
It is an evil power.
———————————————
Our world is one of balance...
Just as there is light to drive away
darkness, so, too, is there
benevolence to banish evil.
———————————————
Head for the sacred grove that lies
deep within the lands guarded by the
spirit Faron.
———————————————
There you will find the blade of
evil's bane that was crafted by
the wisdom of the ancient sages...
the Master Sword.
———————————————
The Master Sword is a sacred blade
that evil can never touch.
———————————————
Evil cloaks you like a dark veil...
and that blade is the only thing
that can cleave it.
———————————————
[Link]... Hero sent by the
goddesses...
———————————————
Like you, I have been granted
special powers by the goddesses...
———————————————
Fine... [Link]... You can...
You can get to the woods...on your
own, right?
———————————————
Princess... I have one last
request...
———————————————
Can you tell him...where to find the
Mirror of Twilight?
———————————————
Midna... I believe I understand now
just who and what you are...
———————————————
Despite your mortal injuries, you
act in our stead...
———————————————
These dark times are the result of
our deeds, yet it is you who have
reaped the penalty.
———————————————
Accept this now, Midna. I pass it to
you...
———————————————
No! [Link]! STOP HER!
———————————————
We go back, [Link]! Back to
Faron Woods!
———————————————
Zelda... I've taken all that you had
to give...though I did not want it.
———————————————
Please, [Link]... Help me.
Help me defeat Zant!
———————————————
We must save Princess Zelda,
[Link]! We must!
———————————————
To Hyrule Castle!
———————————————
Hurry, let's head to the Eldin 
Province to the west!
———————————————
There should be a spirit whose
light was stolen somewhere in
these lands, too...
———————————————
You know what to do, right?
First we need to find the spirit or
we won't be able to return the
light to this land!
———————————————
They said we can't get to the
spirit's spring... What's that
supposed to mean?
———————————————
The sword accepted you as its
master...
———————————————
This thing is the embodiment of the
evil magic that Zant cast on you.
———————————————
It's definitely different from our
tribe's shadow magic...
———————————————
Careful... If you touch it, you'll turn
back into a beast!
———————————————
This thing is too dangerous...
It's probably for the best if we
just leave it here, huh?
———————————————
But on the other hand...if we kept
it, you'd be able to transform into
a beast anytime you wanted...
———————————————
Yes, since Zant was kind enough
to give this to us, we should be
thankful and use it all we can!
———————————————
If you need it, just call me. I want
to keep a low profile, so I'll hide in
your shadow when you're human,
but I can change you whenever.
You can be a wolf anytime you like!
Also, thanks to this thing, you can
warp whenever you want by
switching into wolf form...

———————————————
Hey, but listen, [Link]...
I've got a little favor to ask...
———————————————
Would you mind coming with me to
find something called the Mirror of
Twilight? It's hidden somewhere
in Hyrule...
———————————————
Yes, the Mirror of Twilight...
Our last potential link to Zant!
———————————————
Well, if there's a spirit in Lake
Hylia, then we need to go there.
———————————————
All right... I wonder where the
spirit Eldin could be?
———————————————
A cursed mirror that sends people
to another realm... That sounds like
the Mirror of Twilight.
———————————————
[Link], hurry.
———————————————
If you put on that armor the Zora
queen gave you, you should be able
to dive even to the bottom of the
lake with ease.
———————————————
I know it's been a lot of trouble,
but we've got the last Fused
Shadow almost in our grasp...
———————————————
We're headed for the underwater
temple in Lake Hylia...so make sure
you're prepared!
———————————————
Wait, [Link].
———————————————
Before we go on, there's something
I want you to hear.
———————————————
...Do you remember what the spirit
said about the Fused Shadows?
———————————————
What do you think happened to
the magic wielders who tried to
rule the Sacred Realm?
———————————————
They were banished. They were
chased across the sacred lands of
Hyrule and driven into another
realm by the goddesses.
———————————————
It was another world entirely...
The antithesis of Hyrule, where the
sun shines bright.
———————————————
Its denizens became shadows that
could not mingle with the light.
———————————————
Eventually, most came to call it the
Twilight Realm, and from it, none
could return to the world of light...
———————————————
They were forever doomed to live in
the twilight, flitting in the half-light
of dusk, mere shadows of Hyrule...
———————————————
This is the history of the Twili as it
has been passed down from our
ancestors...
———————————————
Do you now understand what I am?
———————————————
I'm a descendant of the tribe that
was banished to the Twilight Realm!
———————————————
It was a peaceful place...until Zant
took control of the Twilight Realm
and transformed all of the Twili
into shadow beasts.
———————————————
It's clear to me now that he
somehow gained a great evil power
previously unknown to our tribe...
———————————————
In any case, I was sent from there,
and could no longer get into the
Twilight Realm without his power.
———————————————
...But there's another tale told by
my people.
———————————————
Though the goddesses forbade us
to return to the world of light, they
left one link between the light and
the darkness.
———————————————
Something called the Mirror of
Twilight was passed to the
protectors of Hyrule...
———————————————
It's our only path to the Twilight
Realm...and we must get there!
———————————————
You'll come with me...won't you?
———————————————
What's going on around here?!
I don't understand...
———————————————
I think the spirit's spring should be
around here somewhere. Let's look
around some more...
———————————————
Why don't you start by looking
around here?

———————————————
It sure does seem like something
strange is going on in this lake...
———————————————
All you have to do is find the dark
insects and reclaim all the Tears of
Light, right?
———————————————
Use the map to find the locations
of the bugs. It's so simple!
———————————————
That just leaves using your [X]
senses and attacking! Hurry up and
start looking!
———————————————
If you don't help the light spirits,
this world will forever be covered
in twilight as it is now.
———————————————
Some call our realm a world of
shadows, but that makes it sound
unpleasant...
———————————————
The twilight there holds a serene
beauty... You have seen it yourself
as the sun sets on this world.
———————————————
Bathed in that light, all people were
pure and gentle...
———————————————
But things changed once that foul
power pervaded the world...
———————————————
It was all our doing...
———————————————
We overestimated our abilities as
sages and attempted to put an end
to Ganondorf's evil magic...
———————————————
I hope you can find it in yourself
to forgive our carelessness...
———————————————
O Twilight Princess.
———————————————
What? So...you knew?
———————————————
As a ruler who fled her people, I'm
hardly qualified to forgive you.
———————————————
In our world, we've long believed
that the Hero would appear as a
divine beast.
———————————————
That's why when I found you,
I thought I could use you,
[Link].
———————————————
And I only cared about returning
our world to normal...
———————————————
I didn't care what happened to the
world of light, not at all.
———————————————
But after witnessing the selfless
lengths that Princess Zelda and you
have gone to... Your sacrifices...
———————————————
I now know, in the bottom of my
heart, that I must save this world,
too. There is no other way.
———————————————
If we can just defeat Zant, the
curse on me will dissolve, and we
may be able to revive Zelda.
———————————————
Let's go, [Link]! For Zelda!
For all of this world!
———————————————
A dark entity lurks in the twilight...
It houses an evil power...
———————————————
You who are guided by fate...
You who possess the crest of the
goddesses... Hear us.
———————————————
At the command of the goddesses,
we sages have guarded the Mirror
of Twilight since ancient times.
———————————————
You seek it...but the Mirror of
Twilight has been fragmented by
mighty magic.
———————————————
That magic is a dark power that
only he possesses...
———————————————
His name is...
———————————————
Ganondorf.
———————————————
He was the leader of a band of
thieves who invaded Hyrule in the
hopes of establishing dominion
over the Sacred Realm.
———————————————
He was known as a demon thief, an
evil-magic wielder renowned for
his ruthlessness...
———————————————
But he was blind...
———————————————
In all of his fury and might, he was
blind to any danger, and thus was
he exposed, subdued, and brought
to justice.
———————————————
Yet...
———————————————
By some divine prank, he, too,
had been blessed with the chosen
power of the gods.
———————————————
His abiding hatred and lust for
power turned to purest malice...
———————————————
Perhaps that evil power has been
passed on to Zant...
———————————————
You're just now figuring out where
Zant got his power? It's far too
late...
———————————————
Only the true leader of the Twili
can utterly destroy the Mirror of
Twilight...so Zant could merely
break it into pieces.
———————————————
Once broken by magic, the Mirror
of Twilight became fragments,
which even now lie hidden across
the land of Hyrule.
———————————————
One is in the snowy mountain
heights...
———————————————
One is in an ancient grove...
———————————————
And one is in the heavens...
———————————————
You who have been sent by the
goddesses... You should be able to
gather the three pieces...
———————————————
But you must be prepared, for a
dangerous power resides in those
fragments...
———————————————
You'd better fill the Vessel of Light
with all of the tears or there's no
telling what will happen...[sfx] Eee hee!
———————————————
Now just use your [+v] senses and
attack! Hurry!
———————————————
So that must mean that we can't
get to the spirit's spring because
Lake Hylia's dried up, right?
———————————————
Hmm... First, we'd better do
something about Lake Hylia...
———————————————
Oh no... Do I have to hold your
hand through this?
———————————————
Amazing... There isn't even a drop
of water in the river...
———————————————
Zant.
———————————————
Isn't this ironic? Here we are, all
thanks to the dark magic curse you
placed on [Link]!
———————————————
You speak of magic? Still your
tongue for a moment, whelp, and I
will tell you of both magic and
the oppression of ages...
———————————————
The people of our tribe...a tribe
that mastered the arts of magic...
were locked away in this world like
insects in a cage.
———————————————
In the shadows we regressed,
so much so that we soon knew
neither anger nor hatred...nor even
the faintest bloom of desire.
———————————————
And all of it was the fault of a
useless, do-nothing royal family
that had resigned itself to this
miserable half-existence!
———————————————
I had served and endured in that
depraved household for far too
long, my impudent princess.
———————————————
And why, you ask? Because I
believed I would be the next to rule
our people! THAT is why!
———————————————
But would they acknowledge me as
their king? No! And as such, I was
denied the magic powers befitting
our ruler.
———————————————
It was then, in the thrall of hatred
and despair, that I turned my eyes
to the heavens...and found a god.
———————————————
I shall house my power in you...
———————————————
If there is anything you desire,
then I shall desire it, too.
———————————————
My god had only one wish...
———————————————
To merge shadow and light...and
make darkness!
———————————————
We should reach the water source if
we stay on this path, right? Right.
So let's hurry!
———————————————
Who'd have thought that Zora's
Domain was covered in ice...
———————————————
Oh no...  I can't believe what we've
gotten ourselves into.
———————————————
Use [1] and [2] to check your map
and find the locations of the bugs.
It's so simple!
———————————————
Y-You...TRAITORS!
———————————————
Traitors, ha! You want to know why
none would call you king? It was
your eyes, Zant.

All saw it, a lust for power burning
in your pupils... Did you think we'd
forget our ancestors lost their king
to such greed?
———————————————
Midna... Foolish Twilight Princess...
The curse on you cannot be
broken...
———————————————
It was placed on you by the magic
of my god! The power you held as
leader of the Twili will never return!
———————————————
Already he has descended and
been reborn in this world...


As long as my master, Ganon,
survives, he will resurrect me
without cease!
———————————————
I... I used just a fraction of the
power that's in me now...
———————————————
I did THAT using only a fraction
of my ancestors' magic?!
———————————————
[Link]! Now is the time!
We must save Zelda!
———————————————
The evil power Zant was wielding...
I couldn't take it from him. But at
least I still have the magic of my
ancestors...
———————————————
With it, I can return the cherished
power Zelda bestowed upon me...
———————————————
Now! Let's go! Princess Zelda is
waiting!
———————————————
This is not a time for idle chitchat!
Hurry up and get it done!
———————————————
[Link]! Pay attention!
———————————————
That's your town, right? Don't ask
me, you should know in your heart!
———————————————
If you want to save the
townspeople, you must go back
into the twilight!
———————————————
It's your town, isn't it?! Don't you
have some idea of where a sword
might be?!
———————————————
Take advantage of the way you
look! Rather than ask me, why
don't you try asking the animals?!
———————————————
Welcome to my castle.
———————————————
So you're...Ganondorf.
———————————————
I've been dying to meet you.
———————————————
Your people have long amused me,
Midna. To defy the gods with such
petty magic, only to be cast aside...
How very pathetic.
———————————————
Pathetic as they were, though, they
served me well. Their anguish was
my nourishment.
———————————————
Their hatred bled across the void
and awakened me. I drew deep of
it and grew strong again.
———————————————
Your people had some skill, to be
sure...but they lacked true power.
———————————————
The kind of absolute power that
those chosen by the gods wield.
———————————————
He who wields such power would
make a suitable king for this world,
don't you think?
———————————————
Ha! Such conceit!
———————————————
But if you are one of the chosen
wielders of power, as you claim...
———————————————
I will risk everything to deny you!
———————————————
I will risk everything to deny you!
———————————————
Shadow has been moved by light,
it seems...
———————————————
...How amusing.
———————————————
Very well... Deny me, then!
———————————————
Yes, try to deny me... You and your
little friend...
———————————————
Both of you, faithless fools who
would dare to take up arms against
the king of light and shadow...
———————————————
I don't know where the Mirror of
Twilight is, but it should be
somewhere in Hyrule.
———————————————
I want you to help me find the
mirror, our only connection to
Zant...
———————————————
You listening? Look for a sword
and shield that'll suit me. Got it?
———————————————
Sounds like there should be a
shield at the house with the 
waterwheel. Sneak in there and
take it, will you?
———————————————
The location of the shield... 
You know where it is, right?
———————————————
Go back to the house with the
waterwheel and get it!
———————————————
Sounds like the sword that was
supposed to be an offering to
Hyrule was left on top of the sofa...
———————————————
The people around here are so
nice! I think we can just take it!
———————————————
If you want to save the
townspeople, you should return to
the twilight!
———————————————
The forest where you were
transformed into what you are
now... You know where it is, right?
———————————————
Pr-Princess... I... I... 
———————————————
Say nothing, Midna...
———————————————
Your heart and mine were as one,
however briefly...
———————————————
Such suffering you have endured...
———————————————
Spirits of the light! Wielders of the
great power that shines far and
wide upon the lands of our world...
———————————————
In my hour of need, grant me the
light to banish evil!
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
Chosen hero!
———————————————
Lend us the last of your power!
———————————————
All right...Now where's that
shield?
———————————————
Hey, come on, why don't you 
hurry up and grab that shield!
———————————————
Ready? So... The thing that I'm
looking for is located in the temple
in Faron Woods.
———————————————
Quit lollygagging around here and
hurry up and look for it!
———————————————
All right, so next we have to look
for the sword!
———————————————
Now that we've seen it, it's not like
we can ignore what's happening in
Zora's Domain.
———————————————
Unless we can melt the ice, the
water will never be restored to
Lake Hylia.
———————————————
We have to think of a way to melt
the ice...
———————————————
We took the long route, but it's 
almost time to meet the spirit...
———————————————
All right, hurry! Let's go meet the
spirit of Lake Hylia!
———————————————
When the chosen ones appear...
———————————————
They are always born into this
world in perfect balance.
———————————————
That is the destiny of the chosen.
That is the fate decreed by your
gods, the only path for those who
bear their crests. 
———————————————
When this world brings forth
another marked as you are...
———————————————
Know too, that it shall also be
visited by one of my blood.
———————————————
Do not think this ends here...
———————————————
The history of light and shadow will
be written in blood!
———————————————
The Lanayru province is vast, so 
finding dark bugs in it is a task in
itself...

———————————————
Use a portal or that bird that you
call near the reed whistles and get
it done!
———————————————
What? Say something!
———————————————
Am I so beautiful that you've no
words left?
———————————————
Well...I guess this is farewell, huh?



Light and shadow can't mix, as we
all know.


But...



Never forget that there's another
world bound to this one.
———————————————
Shadow and light are two sides of
the same coin...
———————————————
One cannot exist without the other.
———————————————
I know now the reason the
goddesses left the Mirror of
Twilight in this world...

They left it because it was their
design that we should meet.
———————————————
Yes... That is what I believe.
———————————————
Zelda... Your words are kind, and
your heart is true.
———————————————
If all in Hyrule are like you...
———————————————
Then maybe you'll do all right.
———————————————
Thank you...



Well, the princess spoke truly:
as long as that mirror's around,
we could meet again...
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
I...
———————————————
See you later...
———————————————
I think it's just a matter of time
before light shines on the twilight 
in Lanayru Province.
———————————————
Hurry! Go get that last Tear of
Light!
———————————————
All right... This is the real thing!
Hurry up and find the last Fused 
Shadow!
———————————————
I guess it's in the Lakebed Temple
of Lake Hylia but...can you swim?
———————————————
To get your hands on the last
Fused Shadow, you have to dive to
the bottom of Lake Hylia.
———————————————
Well then, why don't you save the
prince of the Zoras just as the
Zora queen asked?
———————————————
The Zoras are usually the
protectors of Lakebed Temple, so
I think they should help us...
———————————————
[Link]! The Mirror of
Twilight is so close... Let's hurry!
———————————————
Who knew that a place like this
existed within Faron Woods...
———————————————
Sounds like the wind... Do you
hear something,  [Link]?

have to find a portal in this area
first!

No, [Link]! The darkness is
too powerful in fog like this.
Remain in wolf form!

[Link],

There is something about Ilia's 
memory that I wish to tell you.

I know you are busy, but please
come visit me in my sanctuary in
Kakariko Village. 
———————————————
Oooh, I was so happy to see you
the other day. I really had fun!

I was also so happy to see my 
son's face again. SO HAPPY!

I'd like you to know, we will be
heading to another location soon.

If you continue on your travels,
chances are that we'll meet again.

My son and I are certainly looking
forward to seeing you again.
Take care of yourself!
           Ooccoo
———————————————
I was so happy to meet you and
spend a bit of time with you!

I am planning a trip to a new
location, just so you know.

If you continue your journeys,
we might see each other again!

So take care of yourself...
   

P.S. I didn't have a chance to tell
you this last time, but I have a
son. I'll introduce you if we meet
again! He's a good boy who can
help you like an item, so be nice!

                      From Ooccoo

Agitha had a dream last night.

Butterflies surrounded Agitha and
lifted her up to the sky.

As she waved to the people below
in Castle Town, she could see so
many people, some waving back,
others staring wide-eyed.



Agitha flew in a big circle above
Hyrule Field and the butterflies
formed into a bed beneath her
and said, "Let's play again..."
Soon they faded away and she
woke up in her own bed.

Ohh... Agitha wants so badly to
fly in the sky...

Hena's Fishing Hole
It's a fight against nature with

you catch?

We look forward to seeing you
there!
———————————————
Thank you so much for beating
those beasts the other day.

Is the girl doing well? I certainly
hope so.

Though there isn't much to do
here, please stop in sometime!
———————————————




Wow, kid! Awesome!







(My son said that he wanted to
write you a letter... He worked so
hard on it! Goodness, yes!)

We thank you for all your help,
both on land and in the sky. The
other Oocca thank you, as well.

Come visit us anytime! Take care!
———————————————

Dear [Link],

After we parted, I tried that word
on all the statues I could find in
Hyrule, but it was a disaster!
How disappointing!

...But if I let something so small
get to me, my dear father will
scoff at me from beyond the
mortal coil.

I'm going back to the sanctuary in
Kakariko Village to see if I can't
find another lead.

I certainly hope that if you find 
any more information, you will
share it with me posthaste. 

The dream chaser, Shad
———————————————
I feel bad. You paid me visit and
I not much help.

I feel better now. Husband and I
sled lots now. Very much fun.

[Link], you join us at
Snowpeak sometime!
———————————————
It feels creepy...
[Link], be careful.
———————————————
So that big monster with the horns
built a base in a place like this?!
———————————————
This place looks like it'll be
crawling with enemies, so be
careful, OK?
———————————————
Looks like you're trapped...
———————————————
Who knows what's around here, so 
don't let your guard down...
———————————————
Not this guy again!
———————————————
Hmph! Let's teach him that flailing
a giant axe around is NEVER a
good idea!
———————————————
If we want to get out of here, the
only thing we can do is break down
the gate!
———————————————
Look! That boar looks strong
enough to do the job!
———————————————
Hey, don't lose sight of that
monkey!
———————————————
Now that you don't have your
lantern, you kind of have to follow
her, right?
———————————————
Well, well... This place is hopping...
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Maybe if you light the candles,
you'll find the basement entrance...
Don't you think? This sanctuary is
old, but it sure is extravagant!
———————————————
You haven't forgotten about the
spirit, have you? Hurry up and talk
to it!
———————————————
Hurry up and get the gift from the
Zora queen!
———————————————
Apparently that girl is holding the 
key to the sky...
———————————————
[Link], we have to help her
get her memory back!
———————————————
I'm happy we were able to help that
girl get her memory back.
———————————————
And as a result, we were able to get
a tip on how to get to the sky!
———————————————
[Link], almost done!
———————————————
It looks as though this is the
summit.
———————————————
Hey... Hey! A giant white beast
holding a red fish...
———————————————
At least your efforts yielded
something... Who would have
thought the yeti would have one of
the mirror shards?
———————————————
All right! Let's hurry to the yeti's
house!
———————————————
If we follow the scent, we may be
able to get through the snow!
———————————————
We don't have any other option
right now... We'll just have to give
it a try!
———————————————
Hurry! Let's get the mirror shard
from the house of the Snowpeak
yeti!

Sorry about giving you so much

but it's in my genes to obey anyone
who blows a reed. How sad...
———————————————
I'll tell you what... Next time, call
me like that when you need
something. Who knows? I might be
able to help you out!
———————————————
Hey there, [Link].
I hope that you'll call on me again
someday. I'll help you out!

To make up for it, I'd be happy to
take a look around and see if
there are any nearby items that
might interest you!
———————————————
Let me make up for that mess
earlier by pointing out any
wonderful items around here!
———————————————
[Link], there's nothing
around here.
———————————————
Hey! There's something near here,

we're getting closer to the sky...
———————————————
Let's do what we can for now,
[Link].
———————————————
I wonder what's hidden behind the
stone statue...

———————————————
A cannon...huh?

———————————————
I never expected to see something
weird like that...anywhere besides
that odd ride in Lake Hylia.
———————————————
All right, [Link], let's go!
———————————————
We're close to the Mirror of
Twilight...
———————————————
All right. The second Fused Shadow
must be somewhere here on Death
Mountain.
———————————————
This is just one big pile of rocks.
I don't know where we'll find it,
so we'll just have to do a thorough
search!
———————————————
That Goron elder is hiding
something...
———————————————
Hey! Don't tell me you're afraid of
these Gorons all of a sudden! If
you can't sweet-talk 'em, you'll

They ain't listenin' to me lately!
———————————————
Hey, where's [Epona]?
———————————————
Hey! [Link]!
———————————————
Oh, hi, [Link].
———————————————
I washed [Epona] for you!
———————————————
If you need anything from me, just
press [+^] to give me a sign!
———————————————
Twilight covered Hyrule like a
shroud, and without light, the
people became as spirits.
———————————————
Within the twilight, they live on,
unaware that they have passed into
spirit forms...
———————————————
All the people know now is fear...
Fear of a nameless evil...
———————————————
You still have not discovered your
true power...
———————————————
Northeast of here, in the lands
guarded by the spirit Lanayru...
———————————————
The dark power that you seek is
within the sleeping Lakebed Temple
in Lake Hylia...
———————————————
So you say the bridge to the west
has been destroyed, huh? Then our
only option is to cross the bridge
to the east.
———————————————
So you choose. And so you shall
feel my wrath!
———————————————
An impressive-looking blade...
———————————————
But nothing more.
———————————————
Would you hear my desire?
———————————————
To take this foul blade...and use
it to blot out the light forever!
———————————————
I'll try to slow Ganondorf with my
light arrows!
———————————————
You target him and keep him within
range of my arrows!

It's locked...
———————————————
Are you winning lots of Rupees?
———————————————
I hope you'll come again!
———————————————
Ummm... Hrmmm... That looks a bit
too far to fly...
———————————————
At this rate, the lake will most
definitely vanish if we don't
somehow get water from Zora's
Domain upstream...
———————————————
The drop in water has been faster
than predicted...
———————————————
At this rate, Lake Hylia will dry up.
It's a race against time...
———————————————
There must be a way...
———————————————
For now, we just need to find a way
back upstream to Zora's domain...
———————————————
I wonder if the queen and our
peers in Zora's Domain are safe...
———————————————
We've had absolutely no water
flowing from upstream...
———————————————
There's no mistaking it. Something
must have happened at the water's
source in our home, Zora's Domain.
———————————————
Yet how are we to return upstream
to our home? With the way things
are now, we can't even walk back
there...
———————————————
What's that over there?
———————————————
What was that thing?!
———————————————
[v]
Spring of the Spirit Lanayru
———————————————
Lock-on with [L] and use your
Gale Boomerang to put out the fire
on that horse cart!
———————————————
Hurrrm... I'm too old for this...
———————————————
[ 5C]Fyer and Falbi's Watertop Land of
Fantastication...
———————————————
It's our grand reopening at our new
lake-bottom location... Whee.
———————————————
Hurrrm...
———————————————
Yeah, nice lake... Don't lakes have
more...I don't know...water?
———————————————
Did the Zoras who live upriver do
something?
———————————————
Or is it a curse from that spirit that
floats around up there?
———————————————
Whatever. It's not like I can go up
and complain... That's way too
high.
———————————————
Whuzzat, a customer?!
———————————————
YIKES! IT'S A MONSTER!
———————————————
Stay away... Stay away...
———————————————
Lake Hylia's Newest Attraction!
[ 5C]Fyer and Falbi's Watertop
Land of Fantastication!
         Free* Admission
(*Cash required for each ride)
———————————————
Hurrrm...
———————————————
We're never going to get customers
with things as they are...
———————————————
Today...
———————————————
I haven't spoken to a single
person...
———————————————
Can't blast anyone from the cannon
toward the Zora village upriver...
———————————————
............
———————————————
So...tired...
———————————————
Customers...
———————————————
won't come...
———————————————
even though...
———————————————
the water's back...
———————————————
Maybe no one knows...
———————————————
Perhaps I should go...tell folks...
around town...
———————————————
............
———————————————
So...tired...
———————————————
Hurrrm... No...customers...
———————————————
And...
———————————————
None likely to come...
———————————————
The road above connecting...is
gone and all...
———————————————
Maybe I should go ask the spirit for
success in business...
———————————————
............
———————————————
So...tired...
———————————————
Oh... Are you a customer?
———————————————
Heh heh! You are ONE lucky fella,
fella!
———————————————
The HEIGHT of excitement, the
THRILL of launching to the
heavens, the very PEAK of flying
fantastication...
———————————————
It can be YOURS, fella! For a
limited time only, and without
waiting in line, it's a paltry
10 RUPEES!
———————————————
Whaddaya say, buddy of mine?
Wanna give it a shot?
———————————————
Aww, that's too bad... It's fun.
You should try it.
———————————————
...Ooh, ouch. Y'see, fella, I can
only take paying customers.
———————————————
How about you go find some money
and come on back?
———————————————
Welcome, fella! And right this way!
———————————————
Hey... You're back!
———————————————
Heh heh... So, fella...I guess you
liked the ride, huh? Not a bad bit
of fantastication!
———————————————
Heh heh... Hurry up and hop on
in...
———————————————
Hey! Where are you going, fella?
You already paid and everything...
———————————————
Nuh-uh. Sorry, fella. No reentry,
I'm afraid. Maybe next time you'll
be more careful.
———————————————
Heh heh... So...
———————————————
Thank ya kindly!
———————————————
Wait, what? No! Later! Later!
If you want me to look, come back
another time!
———————————————
I haven't got all day, y'know! Hurry
up and get in there, fella!
———————————————
I want customers, but nobody
comes... The only customers who
DO come are monsters I don't want
to see...
———————————————
[.]Normal flight
[.]Oasis flight
[.]Quit
———————————————
What, that again?! Buddy of mine,
you need to live a little...
———————————————
Eh, whatever. One for the normal
flight. Right this way...
———————————————
Heh heh... Yeah, I knew you'd go
for that one, fella...
———————————————
Well, happy flying... One for the
oasis flight, coming up!
———————————————
Thanks for flying with Fyer, fella.
———————————————
So... Wanna give it a shot, fella?
No hidden fees! Just 10 Rupees!
———————————————
That one, eh? Heh heh... OK!
One for normal, right this way.
———————————————
That one, eh? Heh heh... OK!
One for oasis, right this way.
———————————————
Hrrrm... From old Auru, huh...
———————————————
Ah well, I guess I oughta do what
the old coot says...
———————————————
Oasis flight...right?
———————————————
So here you go, one of our secret
options not available to the
general public...
———————————————
This time's all paid for...so
whaddaya say? You wanna go?
———————————————
All righty then... But remember,
next time, you gotta pay!
———————————————
Sweet sailing, buddy of mine.
One for oasis...fire in the hole!
———————————————
...Pffft, really? Why come all this
way just to chicken out?
———————————————
Hurrm, blast it... Well, you get
ready, then. I'll wait here, OK?
———————————————
So... What's next for you?
———————————————
You're raring to go, huh? That's
the desert oasis flight...right?
———————————————
Ready to give it a shot? If you
wanna quit, press [B].
———————————————
What?! Hurrrm... Can't figure out
what you're waiting on, fella...
———————————————
The mysterious charms of the
desert await...so get on with it!
———————————————
Heh heh... All right, buddy of mine!
Let's get you zooming!
———————————————
Yeah, this time is free just 'cause
I don't need to be getting an earful
from the old fella later on.
———————————————
So then... One for the oasis flight!
———————————————
Aww... Live a little, buddy!
———————————————
Normal flights are all well and
good...but that oasis is NICE,
buddy. I'm tellin' you...
———————————————
Maybe next time, eh... One for
normal, right this way.
———————————————
Hurrrm... I'm afraid you've gotta
pay for that flight out of your
own pocket, fella.
———————————————
If you want to fly, you need the
cash, fella...
———————————————
So, buddy... How was it? A flight of
fantastication to a hidden oasis...
Heh heh...
———————————————
Keep flying with Fyer, eh, buddy?
———————————————
So... Wanna give it a shot, fella?
No hidden fees! Just 10 Rupees!
———————————————
Hey, buddy!
———————————————
So... Uh, is that yours?
———————————————
Heh heh... Hey, buddy, I never
thought you'd get so hooked on
fantastication that you'd try to
build your own cannon!
———————————————
So...are you gonna give me the tour
or what? Looks like you have a 
serious rig over there...
———————————————
Whoa! It's kind of...retro, huh?
———————————————
And there's no ignition device,
so you can't even use it.
———————————————
Listen, buddy, I suppose I might
be able to fix it for you...
———————————————
I mean, maybe...
———————————————
That is, if you can pay me
300 Rupees...in advance.
Whaddaya say?
———————————————
What? Really? What a waste...
———————————————
'Cause I think this thing would
pack a punch. Yeah, it would send
you sky-high!
———————————————
Not that it's any of my business,
though.
———————————————
Well, I gotta get back to work here,
buddy...
———————————————
Hurrrm... I dunno, this thing looks
PRETTY complicated...
———————————————
Yeah, if you want this done right,
you're gonna have to pay for it.
———————————————
Well, I gotta get back to work here,
buddy.
———————————————
Heh heh... I knew you'd see the
light, buddy.
———————————————
Now I'll just be a sec!
———————————————
Here we go, buddy.
———————————————
All working as it should...I think.
———————————————
It may look like junk, but this
thing's got some powerful innards!
———————————————
You're going to be knocking on
the door to the heavens! Seriously,
bud... It might be rough!
———————————————
So... I'm sorry for soaking you for
the dough. I'll leave you alone,
then.
———————————————
Heh heh... Well, you just have all
the fun you want, OK, buddy?
———————————————
Ahh... That thing over there?
———————————————
Hurrrm, yeah, sure...
———————————————
Well, how about 300 Rupees?
...Sound good?
———————————————
That's too bad. I coulda done a lot
with that thing...
———————————————
I mean, you coulda flown up
through the sky, I kid you not!
———————————————
Not that it's any of my business,
though.
———————————————
Yeah, no way... That thing looks
REALLY complex.
———————————————
If you want it fixed, I need to see
some cash, buddy.
———————————————
So... Wanna give it a shot, fella?
No hidden fees for any flight!
Just 10 Rupees! If you aren't
interested, just press [B]!
———————————————
Hurrrm? Some of the Zoras are still
alive down under there?
———————————————
I thought maybe they dried up
along with the lake...
———————————————
Hey, buddy, have you heard?
There's like a temple or something
at the bottom of this lake.
———————————————
They put on such airs with all their
rituals and fancy temple hoo-ha...
Then they just disappear...
———————————————
And what's with putting that temple
so deep that humans can't swim
there?! I swear, those Zoras...
———————————————
Uhh...what? You got a cannon
you want me to repair, bud?
———————————————
Well, where is it? I can't repair it
unless you bring it here!
———————————————
If you wanna repair a cannon, you
need to bring it here, buddy...
———————————————
I don't do business trips, buddy.
...They're too boring.
———————————————
...So what'll it be? We doing this?
Or not?
———————————————
So... Wanna give it a shot, fella?
No hidden fees for any flight!
Just 10 Rupees! If you aren't
interested, just press [B]!
———————————————
...What's it gonna be, then?
We doing this? Or not? If you
aren't interested, just press [B]!
———————————————
Well, I fixed it for you... If you
wanna fly in it, knock yourself out!
———————————————
Well, hi there! Welcome to Falbi's
Flight-by-Fowl!
———————————————
Are you ready for a flight full of
dreams and sweet, sweet bonuses?
A Cucco-powered ride around Lake
Hylia? You will LOVE it!
———————————————
Next up for fantastication...
ONE BIG GUY!
Er, just one?
———————————————
Right, then that's 20 Rupees for a 
ticket to the Isle of Riches.
How about it, partner?
———————————————
Aww, really? How sad for you...
———————————————
Well, if you change your mind,
come back anytime, partner!
———————————————
Whoa-oh!
———————————————
Looks like your wallet's a little
light there, partner!
———————————————
How about you save up your
allowance and come back!
———————————————
Awright! Thanks, partner!
———————————————
Now, just grab a Cucco of any color
and try to sail to the Isle of Riches!
———————————————
What's the matter, partner?
———————————————
Just grab a Cucco of any color and
try to sail to the Isle of Riches!
———————————————
There are loads of places hiding
treasure out there! Find your very
own storehouse of dreams!
———————————————
Don't worry, you'll live!
———————————————
So, what color do you fancy,
partner?
———————————————
What's this? You're gonna leave
without flying?
———————————————
Poor form, partner...but please do
come again!
———————————————
If you leave through the door, your
ticket to the Isle of Riches will
expire... You know that, right?
———————————————
Whuh? Where'd all my Cuccos go?
———————————————
Well, I guess you'll have to learn
how to fly on your own, partner!

You ready to roll, [Link]?
You've got to protect these young
ones on the way to Kakariko!
———————————————
OK, it's your turn, honey! We're
counting on you!
———————————————
Nice, honey! Keep up the good
work!
———————————————
[Link]! Use these arrows!
———————————————
Now, get on your horse! Hurry up!
———————————————
Open that gate, honey!
———————————————
[Link]! Put out that fire!
Quickly!
———————————————
Now, back on your horse! Hurry!

[Link], open the gate!

[Link], stay on it!
Look for the openings on their
backs!
———————————————
Here, use these arrows!

[Link], stay on it!
Look for the openings on their
backs!
———————————————
[Link]! If you run out of
arrows, come get some more!
———————————————
[Link], aim for their backs!
And if you run out of arrows,
come get some!
———————————————
Sir, you wear the garb of the hero
in my people's legends...
———————————————
Are you, perhaps...?
———————————————
Well met! I, dear hero, am a maker
of bombs.
———————————————
Pardon me for asking... Have you
heard of water bombs?
———————————————
They are very dangerous indeed,
but you should be able to master
them. I am sure you would find
them quite useful.
———————————————
How would you like to buy some of
my handmade water bombs for
90 Rupees? Hmm?
———————————————
[.]Buy!
[.]Don't buy.
———————————————
Is that so... Well, let me know if
and when you have need of a bomb
that explodes underwater.
———————————————
Well, just for you, I would part with
these water bombs for 90 Rupees.
What do you say?
———————————————
You don't seem to have room
in your bomb bag for any water
bombs...
———————————————
Why don't you make some room in
your bomb bag and come back?
———————————————
Ahh, excuse me, but you don't
seem to have enough Rupees...
———————————————
Please come again when you have
sufficient funds.
———————————————
Let me put these in your bag...
If you ever run out of water
bombs, please come back for more.
———————————————
Which bomb bag do I put them in?
[ 8C][quant.] [item]
 
———————————————

Looks like you are already full
with bombs of a different type...
———————————————
If you like, I can buy those

What do you say?
———————————————
I see... Well, water bombs are
definitely the way to go for
exploding underwater impediments,
so come back if you need some.
———————————————
Well, let me take those for you.
———————————————
So... Should I put some water
bombs in your empty bag? It will
cost you 90 Rupees...
———————————————
Ahh, excuse me, but you seem 
to have insufficient funds...
Please come back when you have
at least 90 Rupees.
———————————————
Er... Your bomb bag is full, but you
already have water bombs...

I can give you more at any time,
so please come by...

———————————————
Hm... A customer?
———————————————
Sorry, but we're temporarily
closed.
———————————————
.........
———————————————
What?
———————————————
I said we're closed... Now scram!
———————————————
YAAAH!
———————————————
Whoa, that scared me...
———————————————
Who...are you?
———————————————
How can you keep your cool
fighting monsters like that?
———————————————
...Uh... Wow... You...
———————————————
Wow, what a champ you are!
———————————————
...No, I guess not.
———————————————
Well, what are we standing around
jawing for? Come on inside!
———————————————
Golly...
———————————————
Talk about scary... I thought I was
done for!
———————————————
Things have been getting pretty
crazy around here, let me tell you...
———————————————
So thanks for earlier...
———————————————
My name's Iza. I rent boats here.
———————————————
Well, I USED to rent boats here,
but then we had a rockfall and it
dammed the river up.
———————————————
Yeah... I could sure use a helpful
guy around at times like this...
———————————————
Yup, a handy guy would sure be a
big help around here.
———————————————
REALLY?!
———————————————
You're a lifesaver!
———————————————
Well then, just hop in this boat,
get out there, and come back.
———————————————
Just use a bomb arrow or
something to blast that stuff away.
———————————————
There's a bunch of bombs and
arrows in the boat, so just use
whatever you like!
———————————————
There you go, just hop right in!
———————————————
Now...it's a teensy bit dangerous
downriver of here, so don't leave
the boat, OK?
———————————————
One of our part-timers is waiting
down there, so you can get the
details from her!
———————————————
So... Be seeing ya!
———————————————
....Ah, well.
———————————————
Story of my life. There's not much
I can do for you, but come visit
anytime!
———————————————
I just get so awfully bored here
when there's no work...
———————————————
I want to open up again, but we
need to take care of those rocks
blocking the river first...
———————————————
I wish someone could do something
about it...
———————————————
...Ah, well.
———————————————
YAAAAH!
———————————————
You... You're alive?!
———————————————
My part-timer brought the empty
boat back from downstream, so I
just figured...
———————————————
So... Yeah, you're alive! Hahaha,
great!
———————————————
So, uh, hahaha... Wanna go again?
———————————————
...Yeah, I figured...
———————————————
Ah, well... I was looking forward to
opening up the shop and all...
———————————————
Perfect. Just hop in this boat and
go take care of those rocks.
———————————————
And there's plenty of bombs and
arrows in the boat!
———————————————
Make sure you get it this time!
———————————————
Well... Bon voyage!
———————————————
What's...that? A bug?
———————————————
Eww, nasty! Why's it so big?!
———————————————
Golly, I am so sick of roughing it
in the boonies!
———————————————
Hey... You stay away, Mr. Bug!
———————————————
Shoo! Go get squished!
———————————————
Huh... It's gone?
———————————————
That was nasty... I hope it doesn't
come back...
———————————————
......Ah, well.
———————————————
Golly, work is tanking just as hard
as my personal life these days...
———————————————
Golly... What am I going to do?!
———————————————
The water's back, and I still can't
get back in business...
———————————————
I wish some shiny prince would just
show up and fix it all...
———————————————
...Ah, well.
———————————————
Well, do you think you could do
something about that rock?
———————————————
I'll give you some bombs and
arrows, so you just put 'em
together and shoot bomb arrows
at that thing.
———————————————
Hey, hold on! Where are you
going?!
———————————————
If you're not going to help, give me
my bomb bag back!
———————————————
YAY!
———————————————
You did it!
———————————————
Well, my gal tells me there are still
some rocks blocking the way along
the river, so you should take care
of those, too.
———————————————
Here's the boat... Hop in!
———————————————
You know how to make bomb
arrows, right?
———————————————
Just set your bow on the Items 
screen, then choose bombs and
press [R] to combine them.
———————————————
We've got tons of bombs and
arrows, so just holler if you need
them!
———————————————
What? You used all your bombs?
Well, here you go!
———————————————
What? You used all your arrows?
Well, here you go!
———————————————
What? You used all your bombs and
arrows? Well, here you go!
———————————————
...Huh? Why'd you come back?
———————————————
Look, if you pepper me with these
requests for too long, we're going
to have trouble!
———————————————
Or...what? You came back to help?!
———————————————
...No way...
FOR REAL?!
———————————————
Yeah! Well, yeah, sure, of course!
I knew you would all the time!
———————————————
I thought, "Hey, he just needs to
take a quick snooze, then he'll
come right back!"
———————————————
Golly, great! Well, here are some
more bombs and arrows. Now you
go take care of that rock!
———————————————
Hey, what the... Are you running
off again?!
———————————————
Then give me my bomb bag back!
And come back when you can
actually help me out here!
———————————————
Oh, hey, you're back.
———————————————
Not to seem too hasty, but are you
ready to help me out yet?
———————————————
I'll give you some more arrows and
bombs... Just take care of that
rock for me, OK?
———————————————
...And uh, I'm kind of in a hurry, so
do it nice and quick, huh? OK?
———————————————
Here are the bombs and arrows!
Now take care of that rock!
———————————————
Wha... Hey... What the...
What're you doing?!
———————————————
What did you come back for?!
I don't get it!
———————————————
Ah, well... This is just too much
for me...
———————————————
Ah, well... I guess there's no
reason you would...
———————————————
...Ah, well.
———————————————
And when you're done, you can
keep that bomb bag and everything
in it as a token of my appreciation.
———————————————
Hey, welcome!
———————————————
Thanks to you, we're back in
business!
———————————————
Well, we can't offer much, but just
make yourself at home!
———————————————
And, of course, if you want a boat
ride, just let me know! I'd be happy
to rent you one!
———————————————
For a rental fee of 20 Rupees you
get a boat and a guide! You want
one?
———————————————
[.]Rent me one.
[.]Tell me about it.
[.]No, thanks.
———————————————
Oh, OK.
———————————————
Well... Be seeing ya, then.
———————————————
What? You don't have enough
Rupees?
———————————————
Uhh... Sorry!
———————————————
Oh! You want to get in?
———————————————
OK! Now hop in!
———————————————
You all set? Have a good ride!
———————————————
YAAAH!
———————————————
Hey! What're you doing to my
goods?!
———————————————
You do that again, and you're
gonna pay for it!
———————————————
YAAAH!
———————————————
I said not to rough up the goods!
What are you thinking?
———————————————
I told you once, now pay up!
———————————————
10 Rupees!
———————————————
What do you mean, "no"?! You
don't have any right of refusal!
———————————————
Oh, I can keep this up indefinitely
until you pay, so I hope you're
ready for the long haul, pal!
———————————————
That's right! Pay up!
———————————————
...What? What's this? Hey, you! 
You think you're funny?
———————————————
You don't even have the cash!
Where's my money?! ...That's it!
You won't get away with this!
———————————————
COM! PEN! SA! TION!
10 Rupees!
———————————————
Just pay up and we're done here!
Pay up!
———————————————
What do you mean, "no"?! You
don't have any right of refusal!
———————————————
Oh, I can keep this up indefinitely
until you pay, so I hope you're
ready for the long haul, pal!
———————————————
...What? What's this? Hey, you! 
You think you're funny?
———————————————
You don't even have the cash!
Where's my money?! ...That's it!
You won't get away with this!
———————————————
I mean, what are those Zoras up to,
anyway?
———————————————
The river's run totally dry, right?!
———————————————
I can't work like this...
———————————————
Ugh...
———————————————
C-Cold!
———————————————
Ahh... I miss my fur coat...
———————————————
Ugh...
———————————————
Whoever thought renting out boats
was going to be a good idea,
anyway?
———————————————
S-So cold... VERY COLD!
———————————————
Hm... What's this? You seem pretty
cozy with people for a wolf...
———————————————
Well if you don't want to wind up a
rug, you'd better scat! Shoo!
———————————————
Hey! Stay away!
———————————————
YAAHH!
———————————————
Wow! You did it! Thank you!
———————————————
Hey, hey! Listen up! I've got one
more job for you!
———————————————
See, there's a spot upriver where
the water's blocked...
———————————————
Look, your boat's all ready! Yeah,
just climb in!
———————————————
If you hop on a boat here, you can
ride down all the way to Lake Hylia!
———————————————
And feel free to blow up any of the
targets posted around with your
bomb arrows, OK? The targets look
kind of like jars...
———————————————
Green targets are worth 1 point,
red ones are worth 2. If the boat
hits anything, you lose 1 point.
Get at least 25 points for a prize!
———————————————
So what do you say? Want to try it
for 20 Rupees?
———————————————
Hey, hurry up and take out that
rock with your bomb arrows!
———————————————
You're back? Remember, you lose
1 point whenever you hit a wall!
Well, good luck!
———————————————
And have a nice trip!
———————————————
Ah!
———————————————
You've come at the request of the
shop owner, haven't you?
———————————————
Well, I'm in her employ...part-time,
for now. I'm sorry we've troubled
you so.
———————————————
You see... These rocks are blocking
the natural flow of the river.
———————————————
All you need to do is use your
bomb arrows to destroy the
blockage!
———————————————
You did it! Thank you!
———————————————
Ahh... And the water has already
begun to flow.
———————————————
But there are some other blocked
areas up ahead of us.
———————————————
Please continue on and clear them
as well!
———————————————
Good job out there!
———————————————
You have truly done us a great
service. Now the shop can finally
reopen!
———————————————
When we were closed, my boss's
temper only got worse and worse...
It was a rough time for us all...
———————————————
Oh, and another thing...
———————————————
I don't suppose she promised you
anything special for doing this, did
she? Just that bomb bag, right?
———————————————
Yes, she tends to bribe people with
whatever's lying around...
So stingy, really...
———————————————
It's all right. I'll let her know you
kept it when I get back.
———————————————
Now, if you'll excuse me... Come
visit at the shop sometime!
———————————————
Do you think Prince Ralis passed
through here?
———————————————
He must have. This is the only
waterway that connects to Hyrule
Castle.
———————————————
Come. Let's follow this path in
search of him.
———————————————
The place beyond this rock is
sacred to my people. It was once
called the Zora Temple.
———————————————
But now it has been overrun by
monsters... They're everywhere...
———————————————
All we could do was seal them in
so they do not bring darkness to
others...
———————————————
The creatures of darkness have
made the inside of this temple their
home. It's dangerous, so I must
ask that you turn back.
———————————————
The temple inside is nothing but
a nest of darkness now! You must
not enter!
———————————————
...Did you really do it?
———————————————
Thanks for your patronage!
———————————————
On this trip downriver, you scored
[var] destroying targets!
———————————————
Come again anytime!
———————————————
I am a member of the Zora tribe,
the proud people who care for
Lake Hylia.
———————————————
The other Zoras are all on guard
patrol at the bottom of the lake.
———————————————
The bottom of this lake is a sacred
place for us Zoras.
———————————————
Then I shall guide you to the mouth
of the river. Follow me!
———————————————
Congratulations! As the first
customer to score at least 25
points, you receive this prize!
———————————————
Next time, try to get a prize!
———————————————
Congratulations! There's a cash
prize of 100 Rupees for scoring
at least 30 points!
———————————————
Congratulations! There's a cash
prize of 50 Rupees for scoring
at least 25 points!
———————————————
Can you see the bubbles rising
from the depths?
———————————————
It's dangerous to swim too close.
That current is strong enough to
carry away most people...
———————————————
Oh, that's too bad... If you had
gotten at least 25 points, I'd
have given you a lovely prize.
———————————————
...Want to go again? It's just
20 Rupees.
———————————————
Uhh, sorry, but you don't seem to
have enough money...
———————————————
Once you're flush with cash again,
please come see me!
———————————————
Thank you very much! Now, time to
go back upstream!
———————————————
It would be nice if the search
parties for the prince would
make it back safely...
———————————————
I thought it was about time for you
to arrive...
———————————————
Master [Link], is it?
———————————————
Please forgive my rudeness in the
bar the other day.
———————————————
You do know Telma, don't you?
I am Auru. I am part of the group
that Telma kindly allows to meet at
her bar.
———————————————
I have heard all about your deeds
from her.
———————————————
Now... You being a courageous
youth... You have likely heard of
the strange events in the desert
and come to investigate, no?
———————————————
Or am I mistaken?
———————————————
You do know, don't you, Master
[Link]?
———————————————
Aha... So it's true...
———————————————
I see... Well, perhaps you were
drawn here without even knowing
the reason why.
———————————————
There's a story I heard once, long
ago... It was when I worked for the
royal family, educating the young
princess Zelda...
———————————————
The Gerudo Desert once held a
prison built to hold the worst
criminals this land has ever
known...
———————————————
The criminals who were sentenced
to death were sent directly to the
underworld by a cursed mirror that
was kept in the prison...
———————————————
Now that prison is condemned,
and even the road leading to the
desert is impassable.
———————————————
This desert at world's end... It still
holds the cursed mirror and the
malice of the doomed inmates...
———————————————
These old bones know that the evil
currently plaguing Hyrule is related
to this wicked place. So I have
come to learn the truth...
———————————————
Master [Link], I must ask...
What will you do now?
———————————————
Don't tell me you plan to enter the
desert and confirm my suspicions
with your own eyes?!
———————————————
Now, I've been investigating other
ways to enter the desert.
———————————————
You see Lake Hylia below us?
A man named Fyer runs an
amusement ride of sorts there.
Give him this.
———————————————
If you leave the rest up to Fyer,
all should go well.
———————————————
I see...
———————————————
Well, not to pry, but if you were
going to the desert, then I could
have told you how to get there...
———————————————
So if you change your mind, please
let me know. I can be of some
help...
———————————————
Ah, is that so...
———————————————
Then let good old Auru help you
out...
———————————————
See, long ago, I saved this man
Fyer's life, and now he cannot
refuse me if I ask a favor.
———————————————
Young Master [Link]...
What is the trouble?
———————————————
Do you intend to venture into the
desert?
———————————————
Tell me, Master [Link]...
Have you thought about what I
told you?
———————————————
Let me ask again... For the sake of
all Hyrule, will you go into the
desert and subdue the evil there?
———————————————
And as I've said before, I can find
passage to the desert for you.
———————————————
You've not changed your mind...
I can't force you into danger...
———————————————
But I am still of the same mind, as
well. If you agree to help, I'll get
you into the desert.
———————————————
So, how was your human-
cannonball ride into the desert?
———————————————
I'd wager it was some flight! Ha!
You youngsters get to have all the
fun!
———————————————
Just give my note to Fyer, the
man who runs the amusement ride
in Lake Hylia.
———————————————
If you're ready to take your trip to
the desert, simply hand him this
note I've written.
———————————————
Just hand that to Fyer. You'll find
him running an amusement ride
down there on Lake Hylia.
———————————————
If you do this, he will open the way
to the desert for you.
———————————————
...Hey, do you smell anything
funny?
———————————————
Oh no! We're trapped! Get out of
here!
———————————————
Hey! Stop it!
———————————————
I'm your new master now!
Settle down!
———————————————
Hey! Why don't we use this guy to
get us all the way to the lake's
water source?
———————————————
What's this?! That's strange...
The bridge is gone...
———————————————
I wonder if this is the work of
those shadow creatures... Ugh...
What a pain!
———————————————
Ah well, let's look for it... You!
Get your map out!
———————————————
Hmm... Oh well! I guess we need
to look for something to bridge
this gap...
———————————————
OK, let's try heading back!
———————————————
Huh? I didn't know that type of
grass grew here as well...
———————————————
If you used it here, you could get
right back to Lake Hylia, huh?
———————————————
Hey! If you blow that grass there,
the monster bird that was just
here should come back!
———————————————
...And even if you can't play it
yourself, maybe you can sit there
and howl the same song...
———————————————
Hey, why don't you go stand next
to it and press [A] to mimic that
bird call?
———————————————
We didn't get off on the right foot
with that giant bird-monster, but
I think he's come around to my way
of thinking!
———————————————
Ah... We're already here?! That
bird turned out to be more useful
than I expected.
———————————————
Well, then... Where's the village of
the Zoras? Let's look for it.
———————————————
It's getting cold... Hurry up!
———————————————
Hey, haven't we seen this castle
before? [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
So, we finally made it back here!
Well, only a little farther, so hang
in there!
———————————————
Or so I'd like to say, but...
———————————————
The going's a lot harder from here
on out... [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
All right, then... Let's get started.
———————————————
Ugh... Aren't you awake yet?
———————————————
Look! We got washed all the way
down to Lake Hylia, just as I
predicted...
———————————————
And it looks like we're right in
front of the spirit's spring, to boot.
Talk about lucky...
———————————————
Well, let's go! Snap out of it and
get to the spirit!
———————————————
Hey, weren't you supposed to carry
springwater to Castle Town?
———————————————
Hey, what are you doing with
the springwater?
———————————————
If it gets cold, shouldn't we go
back to Kakariko for more?
———————————————
Well, now that we've saved that
Goron, shouldn't we go back and
check out that shop?
———————————————
Hey, how are you going to carry
the springwater?
———————————————
If it breaks, shouldn't we go back
to Kakariko for more?
———————————————
Hey... Careful, now...
———————————————
What do you think, should we try it
again?
———————————————
Isn't there anyone who wants to
help the Zora child?
———————————————
The late queen told us in Zora's
Domain! If we save him, she'll give
us a special power!
———————————————
Hey... Don't waste too much time
with this guy, all right?
———————————————
This guy's defenses are pretty
much impenetrable from the front,
but look closer... It's full of gaps!
———————————————
This guy again... What a pest...
———————————————
I'm telling you, it's a waste, no
matter how many times you battle
him. Teach him a lesson!
———————————————
Take a good look at that guy and
you should see a bunch of gaps in
his armor. Fire arrows into those
spots!
This guy fights dirty, so there's no
reason we can't fight dirty, too!
———————————————
Whoa! That reminds me of
something...
———————————————
Didn't the late queen in Zora's
Domain ask you to do something?
———————————————
She asked us to find her son! The
one who's been missing since he
headed for Hyrule Castle...
———————————————
I think she said something about
granting you some special power
if you rescued him?
———————————————
If the final piece of Fused Shadow
is on the bottom of Lake Hylia...
then it looks like we're going to
need that ability!
———————————————
Phew... That was a close one.
We're lucky there was a puddle
down below, huh?
———————————————
So this is Lake Hylia... But there's
so little water...
———————————————
It sounds like the spirit's spring
should be somewhere around here
as well... Anyway, let's take a look
around...
———————————————
At any rate, let's take a look
around. Come on. Let's go.
———————————————
What're you doing? Run now or
the fire will get you!
———————————————
Jumping down would be better than
the alternative!
———————————————
What's this guy's problem? Looks
like he went and got a nice pair
of matching shields!
———————————————
What an idiot... He's got his sides
protected, but his front is
completely open.
———————————————
Don't waste time going
hand-to-hand with this guy. Use
a projectile when the time is right!
———————————————
You have to save that kid, right?
———————————————
So hurry up and get him!
———————————————
Ugh... This doesn't look good for
that kid.
———————————————
If that guy rushes you, you won't
stand a chance.
———————————————
Do your best to avoid him and slice
him as you pass!
———————————————
But... This is a lake, right? There's
so little water...
———————————————
I thought she said that if you
helped, she'd give you the power
to swim like the Zoras...
———————————————
The last Shadow Crystal is on the
lake bed of Lake Hylia... I think
you'd better get that power!
———————————————
Hey, it was much closer than I
thought...
———————————————
You remember, right? You know
what this is?
———————————————
If you set foot in there, you might
be a wolf again for quite some
time...
———————————————
For at least as long as it takes for
you to save the light of Eldin from
the twilight, anyway...
———————————————
So, shall we try to go see the light
spirit of Eldin? [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
That's a good boy! Now, you need
to listen to what I say from now on!
———————————————
Ahh, look! How lovely! The black
clouds of twilight are so fetching
today...
———————————————
I feel so much more at ease here...
———————————————
And you look so much better like
this than in those dusty old
clothes, anyway. [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
So, let's get going!
———————————————
See, isn't being a wolf more
convenient?
———————————————
Now, use [X] to hone your senses!
You've begun to reawaken as a
wolf, I think.
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Ah, we're finally here.
———————————————
There's only one Fused Shadow
left...
———————————————
...So this is the last of the twilight
you'll see, I guess.
———————————————
Whether or not you accomplish
your final task and survive is up to
you...
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! So what will you do?
———————————————
All right then, I guess I'll have to
help you!
———————————————
But what a shame that this is the
last of the twilight... I had become
so fond of seeing it covering this
world...
———————————————
Or...is it really the last you'll see?
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
So, shall we get going?
———————————————
You smell the girl, don't you?
———————————————
I can tell by the look on your face.
———————————————
Well, good. It's another clue, then.
———————————————
But this scent could be quite old...
I wonder if she is still all right?
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Take out any insects of darkness
you see on the way! It's easy if
you lock on with [L], OK?
———————————————
Where do you think you're going?
There are Tears of Light near here!
———————————————
This isn't the time or the place to
be doing that! You need to do
something about that nasty beast!
———————————————
Hey! What are you doing? Hurry up
and get the last Tear of Light!
———————————————
Hello hello hello hello!
I am Plumm!
———————————————
I'm REALLY excited about the latest
attraction down here at the lake...
Wanna hear about it?
———————————————
If you get 10,000 points, I just
might give you something! Yeah!
You know what I mean?
———————————————
Except... Maybe the attraction is
only for birds. Hmm... Do you ever
fly through the sky? Fly like a bird?
Do you?
———————————————
Oh, you're back?
———————————————
If you want to try out the
attraction, you'll have to fly in the
sky like me, see? Yeah!
———————————————
Oh, was there something else you
needed from me?
———————————————
If you hit a wall and fall off, then
you get NO points! That's right,
0 points for you! Press [B] to start
over from the beginning.
———————————————
If you hit a wall and fall off, then
you get NO points! That's right,
0 points for you! Press [B] to start
over from the beginning.
———————————————
Ah, I see...
———————————————
Your high score is [var]!
———————————————
This attraction is all about popping
balloons as you move toward the
goal! It's stupendous!
———————————————
The balloons are worth different
amounts of points:
Watermelon=1 Orange=3
Strawberry=10
———————————————
Oh, and if you break the same
type of balloon twice in a row,
you get double the points!
But only up to 10 times...
———————————————
You know you get something neat if
you get over 10,000 points, right?
...Not that you ever will!
———————————————
Well, the game starts as soon as
you fly into the air. Yeah!
———————————————
Oh, a human! I'm Plumm!
———————————————
But I don't need to talk to humans!
———————————————
Plumm has no need to speak to
humans...
———————————————
[.]Continue
[.]Start over
[.]Quit
———————————————
Hey! What's the matter?
———————————————
That was so...lame!
———————————————
Well, if you want to fly again, just
come and see me at Lake Hylia.
...I'll be waiting.
———————————————
What?! No way! [var]?!
———————————————
You got more than 10,000 points...
Wow. Here, take this.
———————————————
But... Don't think I'm giving you
this because I like you or anything!
———————————————
So you're completely hooked now,
aren't you? You NEED to go again
to try to beat the high score, don't
you?
———————————————
Well... Uhh, great... A new record!
———————————————
Woooo, that was pretty exciting...
So, let me give you this...
———————————————
Hmmm! [var]...
———————————————
Booooooooooooooooooooooo...
That's nowhere near my personal
best!
———————————————
You'll still come back, right?
I'll be here...
———————————————
Really, you haven't shown me
anything too amazing yet! Nope!
———————————————
So next time, show me a really high
score. Show me something 
OUTSTANDING!
———————————————
How...weak!
———————————————
[var]... I mean, really...
Are you even trying?!
———————————————
But you'll try harder next time,
right? I'll be rooting for you!
———————————————
What... Ooh. 0 points!
———————————————
Are you... Are you making fun of
me?! ARE you?!
———————————————
Look, whatever. Just try harder
next time...
———————————————
...Oh, hey! That was the best flight
I've seen from you! Wanna show me
your moves again?
———————————————
...Oh, hey! You just got the highest
score!
———————————————
So... Wanna go again?
———————————————
Next time, you need to go for the
highest score possible. I'll be
waiting...
———————————————
Why, hello!
———————————————
I'm so sorry, but I was just
finishing up here.
———————————————
If there's something you need,
you'll simply have to visit me in my
posh castle on the other side of
the gate.
———————————————
Oh, hello, puppy...
———————————————
I'm sorry, but I don't speak puppy.
Do you want to play?
———————————————
...Oh, boy! I thought you were a
giant grasshopper!
———————————————
...Oh, boy! I thought you were a
giant jewel beetle!
———————————————
...Oh, boy! I thought you were a
giant scarab beetle!
———————————————
But you're not! You're a person!
Still, you're wearing those clothes,
so that tells me you like bugs too!
———————————————
Oh, boy, I forgot the formalities!
You have an audience with the
princess of the bug kingdom.
Agitha is my name!
———————————————
I've invited the 24 golden bugs of
the world to the ball, but...
———————————————
I don't know if they got lost on the
way or what, but they haven't
shown up yet.
———————————————
If you see them, would you please
bring them here to Agitha's Castle?
And tell them the princess awaits!
———————————————
Only one bug hasn't shown up
yet... We're so close, I don't know
whether to spin a cocoon or fly
into a lamp!
———————————————
If you find the last one, don't you
dawdle! Get the li'l bug back to me
right away!
———————————————
Thanks to you, I have [var] ready
for the ball at my castle!
———————————————
We only need [var] more until all
of them are here... Please do your
best to find partners for the ones
that are not already paired up!
———————————————
As of now, I have [var] at my
castle.
———————————————
I sent out invitations for my ball to
24 gold bugs, but none of them
have arrived yet...
———————————————
If you see them, could you bring
them to my castle on the other side
of the gate?
———————————————
Ooowahhh... Oh noooo...
This is the end.
———————————————
The bridge is broken, so we cannot
carry springwater... Now there is
no way to work...
———————————————
Ahhhhhhhhhhh... I do not feel like
doing a thing...
———————————————
Ahhhh... At times like these, I wish
I could douse myself with piping
hot springwater...
———————————————
Awww... How unlucky...
———————————————
If only that was piping hot
springwater...
———————————————
OOWAAAHHH!
———————————————
I feel rejuvenated!! That smell,
that heat... It is springwater from
back home!
———————————————
Well, I am going to get back to
work and open up the shop!
———————————————
...Hey! You are that human, yes?!
The other Gorons told me about
you, Brother!
———————————————
Just take a look at these rocks! 
Amazing! Was there a landslide
or something?
———————————————
What are you doing here anyway,
Brother? Are you trying to pass
through here?
———————————————
If I drank some hot springwater, it
might give me the strength to break
through a big rockfall like this...
———————————————
Hey, Brother, if you find some hot
springwater, you should come see
me again!
———————————————
Sniff sniff sniff sniff...
Hey, Brother, you smell like you
have some hot springwater there...
———————————————
If I took a drink of that, I would
feel so strong, I could probably get
rid of these rocks!
———————————————
Well, if you want to get through
here, could you give me that
hot springwater you have there?
———————————————
Oh, well, if you do not care, then
I do not either...
———————————————
YESSSSSSSSSSSS!
Goron power, GOOO!
———————————————
Well, I am going to get working on
this, so you should come back
in a little while!
———————————————
Now, you stay strong, Brother!
———————————————
Brother, you have the sweet smell
of hot springwater...
———————————————
Hey! Look, Brother... The way is
now clear, just as I promised!
———————————————
I do not know where you are
headed, but be careful!
———————————————
Now the bridge is fixed, but my
body feels terrible. I just cannot
go look for stuff to sell...
———————————————
You know, all I really need is to
shower myself with some piping
hot springwater to get back to
feeling normal...
———————————————
Say, is that some Kakariko hot
springwater you have there,
Brother?
———————————————
If you poured it on me, I am sure
it would restore my strength...
———————————————
Ohhh... I wish someone would fix
this bridge...
———————————————
Postman
———————————————
Go no further! There is a black wall
ahead that blocks the way!
———————————————
I thought I would deliver a few
letters, but it seems impossible...
———————————————
I am the honorable and dependable
letter carrier, known to some as...
the postman.
———————————————
Now that I have introduced myself,
please! Take this letter and read it
at your leisure!
———————————————

———————————————
Greetings, Mr. [Link]!
———————————————
I have come to deliver a letter.
———————————————
There is a letter for you,
[Link]. [var], in fact!
———————————————
It is a letter from [sender].
———————————————
HEEEEEEY!
———————————————
Mr. [Link]!
WAAAAAAIT!
———————————————
Well, my business is concluded!
Onward to mail!
———————————————
Right now I lack the power that I
normally have.
———————————————
So, impressive isn't it?
This too is the power of twilight...
———————————————
If we only had the power of the
curse that transformed you into a
beast.
———————————————
This is a river, right? Where's all
the water?
———————————————
Looks like we're saved...
———————————————
This is a lake, isn't it? Then how
come there's so little water?
What's going ON?
———————————————
The water's back! We can get the
Vessel of Light!
———————————————
What's this?
———————————————
What's that weird blobby thing?!
Disgusting!
———————————————
See! Just as I thought... [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
So, isn't the power of twilight 
amazing?
———————————————
Call me if you need the power
again. It should help you find what
we're looking for, don't you think?
———————————————
All right! Let's keep going!
———————————————
Ugh! Another pest!
———————————————
I guess he felt like he needed to
call a friend!
———————————————
When it comes close to the earth,
jump on it and try to pull it down!
———————————————
The last insect should be around
here...
———————————————
I get a weird feeling about this
place... Don't let your guard down.
———————————————
What... What is that thing? I've
never seen anything like it!
———————————————
Ugh, I HATE creepy things like that!
Do something, fast!
———————————————
Ugh... I don't want to touch it!
———————————————
H-Hey! While it's flipped over,
jump on and punish it!
———————————————
Hey! Hurry up and pick up the Tear
of Light that it dropped!
———————————————
What?
———————————————
There's something on the other
side there...
———————————————
But unless there's a ledge to help
us cross, we can't reach it...

———————————————
I got word that Ilia's in Kakariko...
which is great, but if she were
doin' all right, she could've sent
me a letter sayin' so, right?
———————————————
You don't think she's found
Kakariko Village to be so darn
pleasant that she forgot her old
pa's face, do you?
———————————————
Say, lad, you findin' those boots to
be helpful?
———————————————
...Renado and the elder Gorons
haven't caught on, right?
———————————————
That daughter of mine finally got
'round to sendin' a letter my way!
———————————————
Readin' it, it sounds like she was
so lonely that she couldn't bring
herself to send one until now...or
somethin' like that.
———————————————
I dunno... Still looks like she forgot
about her old pa to me!
———————————————
What do you think, [Link]?
———————————————
Go on, lad. Open the chest.
———————————————
Hey, hang on! Wait!
———————————————
You've gotta defeat the Gorons,
right? Well, you're not going to do
it without this little secret of mine!
———————————————
You can probably tell, those boots
are made of iron, lad.
———————————————
Whoever wears 'em won't easily be
pushed around...even by a Goron.
———————————————
If you're fixin' to fight a Goron, be
sure to wear those boots.
———————————————
...Let's be square, though, lad: you
can't ever tell ANYONE about those
boots! 'Specially Renado!
———————————————
[Link], you've heard of
sumo wrestlin', right? Gorons like
to match strength in sumo
contests.
Luckily for you, the basics of sumo
are the same as stoppin' chargin'
goats... You wanna hear more?
———————————————
All righty, then. I'll teach you the
basics of the ways of sumo.
———————————————
If you're gettin' in a sumo match,
chances are you're in an arena like
this. The first fella to push his foe
outside the arena wins.
———————————————
Step forward and grab your foe
with [A]. Use [B] to let a retreatin'
foe taste your open palm. Sidestep
a foe's advance with [<][+][>].
———————————————
Three techniques, all of 'em pretty
basic. Master all three and you'll
be shovin' folks out of the arena in
no time, lad!
———————————————
...So, there you go: the basics of
sumo. Need to hear 'em again?
———————————————
Rather than explain a lot, why don't
we just get to it? Come into the
ring, lad.
———————————————
Hmm... Well, the basics are
important, lad, so I'll explain 'em to
you as many times as it takes, all
righty?
———————————————
Whoa ho! Not too shabby, lad!
———————————————
With your natural talent, I'm sure
you can take on the Gorons...
———————————————
You've gotten a sight stronger in
the short time you've been gone,
[Link]... 
———————————————
Strong as you are, though, you
can't hope to beat the Gorons
wrestlin' with power alone. Those
Gorons are made of rock!
———————————————
Naw, the secret to beatin' the
Gorons...is locked away in that
chest.
———————————————
Take it with you, lad.
———————————————
You showed some good moves, lad!
———————————————
You've gotta be diligent in your
daily trainin', and you can't forget
the basics I've taught you. 'Til next
time...
———————————————
What was that, eh? You've gotta
put your back into it, lad!
———————————————
I shared the spirit of sumo with
you, lad, and you've gotta
remember it!
———————————————
For example... Counter the
open-palm strike of [B] by grabbin'
with [A]!
———————————————
For example, if your foe is fixin' to
grab on you, you've gotta sidestep
with [<][+][>].
———————————————
For example... You can counter a
foe who tries to sidestep with the
open-palm strike of [B].
———————————————
For example... If you succeed with
an open-palm strike of [B], follow
immediately by grabbing with [A]!
———————————————
For example... If you manage to
sidestep with [<][+][>], continue on
the offensive with an open-palm
strike of [B] or by grabbing with [A]!
———————————————
For example... If your foe grabs
you, resist with [A]! Push that guy
away to escape the predicament.
———————————————
For example... Once you manage to
grab your foe firmly with [A], hold
on and give him a push with [A]!
———————————————
All righty. If you understand...
Come at me again!
———————————————
If you're lookin' to know the secret
to defeatin' the Gorons, then first
you've gotta have the basics of
sumo pounded into you.
———————————————
I'm happy to be the one to do it,
lad. Come on back anytime!
———————————————
Eh? Back for some more sumo, eh?
———————————————
But I just changed... Well, all
righty. We fight again!
———————————————
We only just battled, so I imagine
you're tuckered out. I'll fight you
anytime, so come on back again.
———————————————
You wanna spar some more,
[Link]?
———————————————
Listen, you wanna beat the
Gorons? Then defeat me in sumo!
...Then we'll talk, lad.
———————————————
All righty, then! First, we change!
Then, we sumo!
———————————————
I see...but I want to do everythin' I
can to help you rescue the kids in
Kakariko...
———————————————
So anytime you want to practice
with me, lemme know.
———————————————
At any rate, if you wanna defeat the
Gorons, you've gotta master the
basics of sumo.
———————————————
I'm still a little tuckered from our
last match, but you wanna fight
again?
———————————————
Hmm... Guess it can't be helped...
But you really think now is a good
time to lollygag around, lad?
———————————————
So, ready for more, eh? All righty,
then, first, we change! Then we
sumo!
———————————————
Eh, what is it, [Link]?
You here for more sumo?
———————————————
Yep, I thought as much! We did just
fight, so you've gotta be as bushed
as I am!
———————————————
Well, I'll take you on anytime you
like, so if you wanna test your
skills, come on back and see me.
———————————————
Eh... Really? You've got sand, lad.
And to think I just changed, too...
———————————————
All righty, then. In that case,
I'll change and we can meet in the
ring once more!
———————————————
Eh? What's the story? You lookin'
to challenge me again?
———————————————
Oh ho! Wise decision, lad! You
can't achieve victory by fightin'
recklessly with a tuckered body.
———————————————
You've got sand, lad, and that's a
good thing! All righty, then, let's
get to fightin' once more!
———————————————
I wouldn't give much for your
chances, fightin' with tired
muscles...but all righty! I'll change
and we can hit the ring once again!
———————————————
Oh, um, good morning to you.
———————————————
If you are looking for my husband,
he took his sword and left early
this morning.
———————————————
But I must ask, [Link]...
———————————————
You have not seen a cradle come
floating by here, have you?
———————————————
It is a baby's cradle made of finely
woven tree bark...
———————————————
Oh, such a misfortune... How far
could it have drifted, I wonder...
———————————————
What am I to do?
———————————————
I made that cradle when my first
child was born, and I have
cherished it all these years...
———————————————
Just where could it have floated
off to, I wonder...
———————————————
Oh! [Link]! That cradle!
———————————————
Did you go to the trouble of finding
it for me? My thanks to you!
———————————————
Oh, that reminds me! There is
something I am supposed to
give to you...
———————————————
Do you think you could carry that
cradle and come with me back to
my house?
———————————————
Oh, my... [Link]!
———————————————
I have been looking for that cradle!
———————————————
I made it when my first child was
born, and I have cherished it all
these years.
———————————————
Did you know all this somehow?
Did you find it and bring it back to
me on purpose?
———————————————
My thanks to you!
———————————————
That reminds me... There is
something I am supposed to give
to you...
———————————————
Do you think you could carry that
cradle and come with me back to
my house?
———————————————
There is something I would like to
give to you, so can you carry that
cradle and come with me?
———————————————
What is wrong, [Link]?
It is this way.
———————————————
What is wrong, [Link]?
It is this way.
———————————————
Oh...
———————————————
Um, could you, perhaps, go a bit
slower, [Link]?
———————————————
Sorry to be so demanding...
———————————————
Hooo... Hahh...
———————————————
Wait a moment, if you please,
[Link]. Let me catch up...
———————————————
My thanks to you, [Link].
———————————————
All right... Here you go!
———————————————
It is a little...unpolished.
———————————————
My son, Colin, made this under the
instruction of his father.
———————————————
You can use it if you like.
———————————————
[Link], I am sorry I asked
such an odd favor of you.
———————————————
So... Here. Take this!
———————————————
When my son Colin grows up, I
want him to be just like you.
———————————————
He really is a sweet boy...
He can just be a little...timid.
———————————————
Oh, hello there, [Link].
Are you going to start preparing 
for your departure?
———————————————
It will seem lonely here while you
are gone in Hyrule.
———————————————
You must promise to take care of
yourself and try not to do anything
beyond your abilities.
———————————————
I am sure it will be a long journey.
Good luck.
———————————————
Yes, yes... I had nearly forgotten...
I am supposed to give you this...
———————————————
Good evening, [Link].
This is a lovely sunset, is it not?
———————————————
It is kind of you to spend time with
my husband, you know... It gives
me time for myself!
———————————————
Oh, do you have to go put the
livestock to bed now?
———————————————
Well, you should get to the ranch
before the sun goes down.
———————————————
All right! First off, we wanna see
THAT move!
———————————————
The slice!
———————————————
Uh... You just swing with [B], right?
———————————————
Wow! A horizontal slice! Was that
it? Was it?


I think I've seen you do a vertical
slice before, too. You know, by
pressing [B] while [L]-targeting.
———————————————
Yeah! A vertical slice! Was that it?
Was it?


I've definitely seen you do a
horizontal slice before, too. You
know, where you just press [B].
———————————————
All right, next...
———————————————
Ooh! Ooh! I wanna see that other
move, [Link]!
———————————————
Yeah! The one where you just tilt
[+][v] while [L]-targeting and press [B]
to flex your muscles and...stab!

———————————————
...Oh, please. The stab?
———————————————
...I don't think that's right...
———————————————
Don't you just press [B] to slice?
———————————————
Ooh! That was SO great,
[Link]!
———————————————
...But that wasn't a stab...
———————————————
What are you mumbling about?!
[Link] did that on purpose!
———————————————
I mean, right, [Link]?
You were just getting ready to
[L]-target and tilt [o][v] so you could
press [B] and stab, right?
———————————————
Ooh, [Link]! Just amazing!
———————————————
Since you're at it, how about you
show us that other move...
———————————————
Y'know, that little twirly thing you
do! I love that! What do you call it?
A spin attack?
———————————————
Like it's hard to briefly hold [B] and release it.
———————————————
...Pssh! He didn't spin at all!
———————————————
And all he had to do was briefly hold [B] and 
then release it. Talk about sad...
———————————————
Ooh, WOW! Thanks, [Link]!
———————————————
I'm sorry you have to waste your
time with these little brats when
you must be tired from doing all
the important stuff you do!
———————————————
Hey! Wait!
———————————————
You've gotta show us the jump
attack before you go!
———————————————
You know, the one where you go
"HYAAH!" and leap through the air!
———————————————
You mean the one where you just hold [L] and
press [A] ? Oh yeah, real tough.
———————————————
What are you doing? That's not it!
The one where you JUMP!
———————————————
I TOLD you! Just [L]-target and press [A]...
———————————————
WHOA!
———————————————
Thanks, [Link]!
———————————————
So, uh, I... I think I get it... Kinda...
Hmm... Maybe not...
———————————————
So this means that anytime one of
those naughty monkeys shows up...
———————————————
WAH!
———————————————
C'MERE, YOU!
———————————————
Gee, you really are amazing,
[Link]!
———————————————
By the way, [Link]...
———————————————
Were you expecting Colin's dad
to bring something by here? 'Cause
he did.
———————————————
Oh, yeah! That's right... What was
that, anyway?!
———————————————
I command you to tell us...
———————————————
Gee, you really are amazing,
[Link]!
———————————————
Yeah, you are! You can use swords
and slingshots and everything!
———————————————
Hey, yeah, that reminds me, you've
gotta teach us how to use a sword,
too!
———————————————
Seriously! Lately these monkeys
have been coming out of the woods
and playing tricks on us! We want
to get them GOOD!
———————————————
C'mon, teach us how to use a
sword!
———————————————
YES!
———————————————
What?! Aw, gee, why not?!
———————————————
Get off your high horse. Just show us.
———————————————
What did Colin's dad bring?
———————————————
Ooh, yeah! I can't stop thinking
about it! Show me!
———————————————
Hurry up... Hurry up!
———————————————
Ooh, my! Isn't that a wooden
sword, [Link]?
———————————————
Whoa... She's right! Hey, can I see
it for a sec?
———————————————
C'mon, be a pal, [Link]...
Teach us how to use a sword!
———————————————
Why won't you just TEACH us?!
———————————————
You'd think since you have the day
off from work you could hang out
with us kids for a while, but no...
———————————————
Check out THESE sword moves,
Malo!
———————————————
If I'd had this wooden sword
yesterday, I could've caught that
naughty monkey, don'tcha think?
———————————————
Wait, weren't you just telling me how you
DID catch the monkey? With [Link]?
———————————————
Uh, yeah, um, anyway... Practice!
Time to practice!
———————————————
I bonked it with this wooden
sword and caught it really quick,
but I felt kinda bad for it, so I let
it go!
———————————————
But you didn't have a wooden sword then,
did you? Mr. Liar?
———————————————
Uh, yeah, anyway... Practice!
Time to practice!
———————————————
Time to practice!
———————————————
Something's fishy about this...
———————————————
Hey, wake up, [Link]!
It's morning already!
———————————————
Hmph! You seem to understand
the basics.
———————————————
All righty, next time I won't go easy
on you, lad. Fight me as if you
were fightin' one of the Gorons!
———————————————
What's the matter, [Link]?
Did you think I was gonna take it
easy on you?
———————————————
If you can't prevail in a match like
this, then you'd have NO chance
against a Goron!
———————————————
Your clothes... What happened to
you, lad?
———————————————
[Link]?!
———————————————
Whoa, it IS you, [Link]!
You're safe and sound!
———————————————
C-Come quick! Inside!
———————————————
I see... So the young'uns are in
Kakariko Village!
———————————————
Well, that's good... Renado's an
old friend. If they're in his care,
then we can relax.
———————————————
So... Don't keep me waitin', lad!
Tell me of my little girl! Ilia is with
the rest of 'em, right?
———————————————
...Oh! I see... That ain't what I
wanted to hear...
———————————————
Ahh... But [Link]...
———————————————
I guess I need to think of all five
of those poor kids, not just my
own... They're all in danger.
———————————————
What I should be askin' is how I
can help out...
———————————————
What's that, now? The Gorons of
Death Mountain?
———————————————
I see... So Renado told you that...
———————————————
Well, it's true...I did defeat the
Gorons in a contest of strength and
earned their trust. ...With the help
of a little secret.
———————————————
I CAN teach you the secret...but
can you promise me that you
absolutely, positively will NOT
disclose it to anyone?
———————————————
Good. All righty, then. Absolutely
no one!
———————————————
Come this way.
———————————————
I see... Well, you understand I
can't teach the secret to a fella
who won't protect it.
———————————————
It's a cryin' shame...
———————————————
Eh? You rethink your answer to my
question, lad?
———————————————
If you give me your word that you
ain't gonna divulge it, I'll teach
you the secret to defeatin' the
Gorons...
———————————————
Like, say, Renado, for example.
You wouldn't tell him, would you?
...Can you gimme your word?
———————————————
What's the matter? You've gotta
hurry to Death Mountain and help
the people of Kakariko!
———————————————
...But you absolutely CAN'T tell
anyone about the boots!
———————————————
C'mon, now, hurry on up an' bring
[Epona] with you.
———————————————
Hey hey, where are you goin'
without [Epona]?
———————————————
Hurry on up an' bring her with
you, bud!
———————————————
Sorry to get you over here in such
a hurry, [Link]!
———————————————
...Huh? But hey, where's
[Epona]?
———————————————
Aw, c'mon, bud! I TOLD you to
bring her!
———————————————
Boy, it's just in one ear with you
an' out t'other, huh, bud? Listen,
there ain't no point without
[Epona].
———————————————
C'mon, now! Hurry up an' bring
her here!
———————————————
These guys have been awful
skittish lately. They won't listen to
a word I say.
———————————————
Sorry to ask, bud, but how's about
you an' [Epona] herd 'em
into the barn real quick?
———————————————
We ain't got much time, so hurry on
up an' get ready.
———————————————
Just climb up onto [Epona]!
Gimme a holler when you're ready!
———————————————
We ain't got much time, so you
think you can do it for me?
———————————————
Much obliged there, bud! OK, then,
go on an' herd all these little
scamps into the barn for me!
———————————————
These dang goats been actin'
pretty weird lately. They won't
listen to a word I say.
———————————————
C'mon, now, [Link]!
Hurry up an' bring [Epona]!
———————————————
[Link], [Epona]...
Look, I'm awful sorry to have to ask
y'all to do this for me.
———————————————
I tell you, though, these scamps
won't listen to a word I say, so I
got no one else to turn to.
———————————————
Y'all about ready to start herdin'
these goats?
———————————————
I'm bettin' that with you two
helpin' out, it'll be done in no time.
———————————————
Just say the word once y'all are
ready to get started!
———————————————
Dang, if it ain't a good thing y'all
came!
———————————————
OK, then! Herd them goats into the
barn with [Epona]!
———————————————
OK, then! Y'all hurry up an' herd all
them goats into the barn!
———————————————
[Link], [Epona]...
Much obliged to both of y'all!
———————————————
I can cover everythin' tomorrow
without havin' to trouble you, so
just sit back an' relax, bud.
———————————————
Oh... But, uh, how 'bout today?
Wanna practice with the fences?
———————————————
Just wait a spell, bud. I'll get them
fences set up.
———————————————
Hoo, sorry that took so long!
OK, then! Y'all ride all you want!
———————————————
Y'all get tired of ridin', just jump
the gate an' head back into the
village, OK, bud?
———————————————
Ain't nothin' cooler than fence
jumpin' done just right!
———————————————
When y'all are approachin' a fence,
use [A] to dash at the right moment
and y'all can jump the middle of the
fence. Got that, bud?
———————————————
Oh, an' if y'all get tired of ridin',
just go ahead an' jump the gate to
head back to the village. I'll put
everythin' away today!
———————————————
Y'all really oughta practice fence-
jumpin', an' that's a fact, bud!
...The ladies SWOON for that stuff!
———————————————
When y'all are approachin' a fence,
use [A] to dash at the right moment
and y'all can jump the middle of the
fence. Got that, bud?
———————————————
If y'all wanna head back, just jump
the gate an' go back to the village.
I can clean up on my own today.
———————————————
What's goin' on, [Link]?
I thought I told y'all to take the day
off, bud!
———————————————
Everythin's fine 'round here!
I'm keepin' a close eye on these
scamps, an' that's the truth.
———————————————
Everythin's fine... I'm keepin' a
close watch on these scamps...
———————————————
Hey, but since y'all got the day off,
you shouldn't be spendin' it here.
Go relax, bud!
———————————————
Oh...
———————————————
I forgot to tell you... The young
tots were pretty fired up talkin'
'bout how they were gonna play
with you today...
———————————————
If y'all ain't got plans, how's about
spendin' some time with 'em?
It'd make 'em real happy!
———————————————
What's the deal, bud?
———————————————
If y'all got some free time, how's
about you go spend it with them
young rascals?
———————————————
Go on, now! Get goin', bud!
———————————————
So, almost time for you to get
goin', huh, [Link]?
———————————————
So how's about we finish up early
today, bud?
———————————————
OK, then! Let's get started!
———————————————
Gotta get them chores done!
———————————————
If y'all wanna get them goats back
into the barn, then climb up onto
[Epona] an' holler at me.
———————————————
What's wrong, [Link]?
You callin' it quits?
———————————————
Hmm? What all's the matter, bud?
Y'all lookin' to start over again,
[Link]?
———————————————
Well then, hurry on up an' get the
job done!
———————————————
Hoo! Now, THAT is dedication!
Wantin' to do the job perfect!
———————————————
OK, then. Let's try 'er again!
———————————————
Hey, [Link], what's wrong?
Y'all were [var] slower than
usual.
———————————————
Hoo, boy, but y'all can herd!
That was [var] faster than
usual!
———————————————
Well, that about wraps 'er up for
today, so how's about y'all head on
over to the mayor's place?
———————————————
Well, that about wraps 'er up for
today, so how's about y'all head on
over to the mayor's place?
———————————————
So, Hyrule, huh? What kinda place
is it, bud?
———————————————
I ain't never so much as set foot
outside Ordon...
———————————————
Hoo... Y'all are makin' me jealous!
———————————————
I'll cover for y'all at the ranch while
you're gone!
———————————————
Since you're goin' all the way to
Hyrule, y'all better enjoy as much
of the trip as you can!
———————————————
OK, then, y'all get outta here.
Head on over to the mayor's place,
an' make it quick!
———————————————
Ohhhh...
———————————————
Awww...
———————————————
...Oh, my... It's young
[Link]...
———————————————
...Welcome, m'dear.
———————————————
You... You didn't happen to see my
little cat out there, did you?
———————————————
He ate the fish we were going to
have for supper last night, and I
gave him a good scolding...but then
he went out and hasn't returned...
———————————————
I'm so fraught with worry for him...
I've exhausted myself...
———————————————
I'm terribly sorry...but my mind is
so filled with thoughts of my little
cat that I simply can't deal with
customers right now...
———————————————
Ohhh... If I had known this was
going to happen, I would have let
my little kitty eat fish to his heart's
content...
———————————————
[Link], m'dear... I'm sorry,
but would you leave me be?
I'll serve you milk later.
———————————————
I'm in no mood to talk, I'm afraid...
———————————————
I'm terribly sorry...but my mind is
just filled with thoughts of my kitty
right now...
———————————————
Oh, my, [Link]! You simply
MUST hear this!
———————————————
Just take a look! My little kitty
[Link] came back!
———————————————
And he brought a fish back with
him. He was worried about me
being angry!
———————————————
Ohhh, just look... Isn't he so cute,
the way he laps up that milk?
———————————————
Say, m'dear, why don't you have
some, too! I'm in a good mood, so
it's on the house today!
———————————————
Oh, my! [Link]! Come in!
———————————————
Oh, you simply MUST hear this!
My little kitty cat is so amazing!
———————————————
Today, he caught a fish all by his
little old self!
———————————————
How do you think he caught it?
Maybe he's a genius!
———————————————
Oh, don't worry, you don't have to
return the empty bottle, m'dear.
———————————————
You can reuse it--you know, put
something else in it. Recycling is
a very important thing, m'dear!
———————————————
I'm sure YOU'D never do anything
of the sort, but kids these days
toss things out like the whole
world was disposable! It's criminal!
———————————————
So, what do you say, m'dear?
Is there anything you want today?
———————————————
If you're interested, take a look
around with [+][>].
———————————————
Anything you want, m'dear?
———————————————
If you're interested, take a look
around with [+][>].
———————————————
Welcome, m'dear!
———————————————
Anything you want, m'dear?
If you're interested, take a look
around with [+][>].
———————————————
Oh, [Link]. Back again?
———————————————
M'dear, I hear you're going to the
castle. Is that true?
———————————————
Why, how nice... I'm sure the
shops in Castle Town are quite
ritzy!
———————————————
So, are you shopping again today?
You can check out my wares with
[+][>].
———————————————
I'll bet he's getting pretty hungry
about now... He's probably longing
for a fish fresh out of the river...
———————————————
Please, come in, m'dear!
———————————————
Aren't you departing for Hyrule
soon? It's always wise to stock up
and prepare before a long journey!
———————————————
Have a look! You can use [+][>] to
inspect what we have available.
———————————————
[Link]! Are you OK?!
———————————————
You're safe?!
———————————————
Oh... Good... That's good, m'dear.
———————————————
But please, you must tell me!
You haven't seen the children,
have you?!
———————————————
Immediately after you left, we were
attacked by beastly monsters...
———————————————
I hesitate to ask, but I must! Please
save the children, [Link]...
———————————————
Oh... I know! Is there anything here
you can use?! I don't have much,
but please take a look around! [+][>]
———————————————
Rusl tried to help the children, but
he was set upon by the beasts. He
last saw the children heading for
the woods.
———————————————
I wonder if maybe the children were
taken off toward Hyrule...
———————————————
...Oh. I'm sorry for rambling,
m'dear. Was there something you
wanted?
———————————————
We haven't been able to get much
stock in, but we do have some left.
Go ahead and browse with [+][>].
———————————————
You'd better stock up so you're
ready for the worst-case scenario,
no? [+][>]
———————————————
Come back if there's anything you
need, OK, m'dear?
———————————————
M'dear... Please... We're counting
on you to bring the children back...
———————————————
Was there anything you wanted,
[Link]?
———————————————
We don't have much in the way of
products...but feel free to look
around with [+][>].
———————————————
If you're done working...do you
think you could look for my little
[Link]?
———————————————
I'll give you this delicious milk
once my kitty comes home...
Please...
———————————————
...If you've come to shop, I'm
sorry, but you'll have to help
yourself by browsing with [+][>]...
———————————————
I just can't even open my shop
right now... Can't somebody look
for him?!
———————————————
I've even got this milk bottle...as a
reward...for finding my kitty...
———————————————
Ah... Oh... Oh! They're in Kakariko
Village!
———————————————
Oh, thank goodness they're all still
alive! I was worried sick...
———————————————
What's that?! The children?!
———————————————
Oh... Oh! So, they're in Kakariko
Village!
———————————————
Oh, thank goodness they're all still
alive! I was worried sick...
———————————————
Of course I want them to come
home as soon as possible, but for
now, it's probably safer for the folk
in Kakariko to look after them...
———————————————
But tell me this, [Link]...
If you're going out there again,
then how are your travel
preparations coming along?
———————————————
If there's something you're looking
for, m'dear, you can use [+][>] to
see if we have it.
———————————————
How are your travel preparations,
[Link]?
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
I hear you managed to find the
children for us!
———————————————
I've been meaning to thank you if I
saw you. And now I will! Thank you
so much, [Link]!
———————————————
Phew... Finally, I can get back to
work in peace...
———————————————
[Link], do you need
something? You should take a look
around here and see if there's
anything you need! [+][>]
———————————————
I'd better lock up tight here...
I couldn't stand to have any more
goods stolen...
———————————————
Can't trust that good-for-nothing
husband to do anything right...
———————————————
Ah, if it isn't young [Link].
Are you going to close down the
ranch for the day?
———————————————
I just closed the shop, myself.
———————————————
I'm sure you know all about the
mischievous monkeys that've been
coming into the village lately...
Those things worry me a bit.
———————————————
I'd be in a terrible fix if my wares
got stolen because I failed to lock
up properly...
———————————————
Oh... Listen to us babble on.
I didn't mean to keep you.
———————————————
All right, off to work with you!
———————————————
Why don't you stop by and do a
little shopping some other time?
———————————————
Good-bye, m'dear! Have a good day
at work.
———————————————
Yo, [Link]! Yo! Up here!
I wanna talk to you! Press [A] while
holding [L] so we can chat!
———————————————
Hey, there you go! Over here!
Yeah! Your voice carries well,
as usual!
———————————————
Maybe you can teach my tykes that
you've gotta press [A] while
[L]-targeting to talk to people from
a distance. They don't get it!
———————————————
So listen, why don't you climb up
those vines there, [Link]?
———————————————
C'mon up! Climb up those vines!
———————————————
Whoa. Hey. You climbed up here
without even yelling up at me first.
You're a spry one, huh?
———————————————
Well, whatever... Check this out
over here... You know Sera, at the
general store? Well, isn't that her
cat over there?
———————————————
Yo! There you are!
———————————————
Check this out... You know Sera, at
the general store? Well, isn't that
her cat over there?
———————————————
He's just been sitting there next to
my house, having a staring contest
with the creek.
———————————————
You don't suppose he's thinking
he's gonna catch a fish, do you?
Ha ha ha! A cat can't catch no fish!
———————————————
Anyway, that's not what I was
meaning to tell you about. I want
you to take a look at something...
———————————————
See that grass growing there on
the edge of that rock? Haven't I
seen you whistling with that stuff?
———————————————
I figured it was pretty rare to see it
growing in a place like that, so I
thought I'd let you know.
———————————————
I bet you could hop across these
rocks with just a quick little [+][v],
couldn't you?
———————————————
What's that stuff thinking, growing
on a rock like that?
———————————————
I guess I just don't understand
grass.
———————————————
Well, since you're up here, why
don't you use [+][v] to hop over
there and play a tune for me?
———————————————
Ahhhh... This sunshine sure does
feel nice...
———————————————
Nothing beats falling asleep to the
sound of a grass whistle for a
midday nap...
———————————————
Call me crazy, but I could listen
to that grass whistle all day long!
———————————————
So, anyway... I guess I'll just get
back to my lounging.
———————————————
Wow. Isn't this just ridiculously
good weather?
———————————————
Sure is peaceful...
———————————————
YO! DON'T WASTE FOOD!
———————————————
Yo, [Link].
———————————————
Sorry if my little tykes were causing
you trouble yesterday.
———————————————
I gave them a ferocious scolding,
so I hope you forgive them.
———————————————
Oh, and hey... You be careful on
your trip to Hyrule Castle,
[Link]!
———————————————
Must be nice to have such fine
weather on the day of your
departure...
———————————————
I'm sure we don't need to worry
about you...but you be careful all
the same!
———————————————
...So, that shield is still in your
house, right?
———————————————
Uh, yeah, it should be in our
storage loft.
———————————————
Good! Go grab it, quick as you can!
———————————————
Rusl got wounded pretty bad, so
he can't go search for the kids.
I'll take over for him.
———————————————
But Rusl had a sword, Mayor!
And he STILL got hurt! If you're
unarmed, you're done for!
———————————————
I'll be fine. The sword we were
goin' to present to the royal family
should still be at Rusl's house.
———————————————
Oh yeah? All right, I understand,
Mayor. I'll hurry up and get that
shield. You just wait here...
———————————————
Hoo... Hah... I think they
scattered...
———————————————
We gotta hurry before the monsters
find us again...
———————————————
You bring the shield that's at your
house.
———————————————
I'll go to Rusl's place and get the
sword we were to present in
Hyrule.
———————————————
Hurry! I'm gonna have to go search
for those children in Rusl's stead.
He's too injured to move quick...
———————————————
Gotcha, Mayor. I'll hurry and get
the shield. You wait here...
———————————————
M-Monsters!



No use! Quick! Hide!
———————————————
No! Again? Quick! Hide!
———————————————
No good! Run!
———————————————
...[Link]! You're OK!
———————————————
You're alive!
———————————————
Do... Do you know what happened?
You haven't seen the tykes, have
you?!
———————————————
These monsters stormed in here
and carried them all off! Ilia, the
little ones...all of them!
———————————————
Rusl got hurt pretty bad, too.
The mayor's gone looking for the
kids...but he's getting on in years,
y'know? I'm worried for him...
———————————————
You've gotta search for the tykes!
Please, [Link]!
———————————————
...Huh?! That shield on your back
is the gift we were going to...
———————————————
I thought the monsters stole it...
but you got it before them?
———————————————
Boy, talk about a misconception
on my part! That's good, though.
Good!
———————————————
You never know where or when
those monsters might appear, so
I hope it's coming in handy for you!
———————————————
Me and Hanch can help out with
the goats, so don't you worry
about a thing.
———————————————
You just get out there and rescue
Ilia and the little tykes for us!
———————————————
...[Link]!
———————————————
You came back alive! Talk about
great news!
———————————————
Listen, PLEASE tell me you know
something about the little tykes!
———————————————
Huh? They're in Kakariko?!
———————————————
Boy, that's a fine fix! We're gonna
have to tell the mayor about that
right away!
———————————————
Hoo... I'm so glad they're safe,
though! I haven't been able to
sleep at night...
———————————————
Thanks... Thanks a lot,
[Link]!
———————————————
I heard you were OK! 
———————————————
Oh, hey... So have you heard?
About our little tykes...
———————————————
Yo, [Link]!
———————————————
What's the latest? Have you gotten
any clues about where our tykes
might be?
———————————————
Well, what the heck are you doing,
[Link]? Go tell the mayor!
———————————————
[Link]... Thanks so much.
———————————————
Well... I'm gonna change my ways
before the children come back.
Yeah, I'm gonna start getting
serious about my work!
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
I-I heard you saved our tykes!
———————————————
Thanks... Thanks, [Link]!
———————————————
Yo, [Link].
———————————————
Think you could find the time to
check in on the kids once in a
while for us?
———————————————
As for me, I'm gonna change my
ways before those kids come home!
Yup! I'm gonna start getting
serious about my work!
———————————————
Hi, [Link]. Welcome.
———————————————
If you're looking for my hubby, he
took a break from working and
went outside.
———————————————
I wouldn't be surprised if he's
taking a nap somewhere...
———————————————
He's in the middle of making a
shield for Colin's dad, Rusl, right
at the moment.
———————————————
See it? Right over there. Though it
looks like it's far from being
done...
———————————————
Sorry you came all this way to find
him out and about...
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
My boys Malo and Talo aren't
giving you headaches, are they?
———————————————
If they are, you feel free to scold
them anytime you like.
———————————————
Hi, [Link]. C'mon in.
———————————————
I've heard a rumor about you!
So, you're going to Hyrule Castle?
———————————————
Isn't that just incredible...
How wonderful for you!
———————————————
If you're looking for my hubby, he's
taking a little break from work.
He said he was going outside to
take a quick nap.
———————————————
He's in the middle of making a
shield for Colin's dad, Rusl, right
at the moment.
———————————————
See it? It's right over there. He's
only got a little bit more to go...
———————————————
But you be careful out there!
And come back safe!
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
I'm sorry Talo and Malo caused you
such a headache yesterday...
———————————————
Thank you for doing what you did.
———————————————
Hi, [Link].
———————————————
I've heard a rumor about you!
So, you're going to Hyrule Castle?
———————————————
Isn't that just incredible...
How wonderful for you!
———————————————
But I suppose I should be
apologizing to you for the trouble
Talo and Malo caused you
yesterday...
———————————————
They're a mischievous pair...but
they'll always be a pair of angels
to their father and me.
———————————————
Thank you so much.
———————————————
[Link], you take care.
And you come back safe.
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
You take good care of yourself.
———————————————
Oh! [Link]!
———————————————
It's true, isn't it? You found the
children?!
———————————————
I really can't thank you enough...
———————————————
I'm so glad that everyone is safe...
Thank you...
———————————————
Tell me, how are my sons doing
over there in Kakariko Village?
———————————————
I worry about the older one's
mischievous side...and his little
brother is still so young.
———————————————
I hope they're being good little
boys for whoever is watching over
them...
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
The children... The children were...
By...monsters...
———————————————
Oh... What are we to do?
———————————————
Talo... Malo... Please! Just be
alive...
———————————————
Th-The children! They're alive?!
———————————————
Oh... Oh, thank heavens! I'd
almost given up hope for them...
———————————————
Thank you so much for coming to
tell me, [Link]!
———————————————
Thank goodness the children are
still alive...
———————————————
You must tell all of the others!
———————————————
Wait a moment... On your back...
That shield...
———————————————
Isn't that the gift my hubby
prepared for Hyrule?
———————————————
I thought we hadn't gotten a
chance to give it to you...
———————————————
Hmm...
———————————————
It's no use. I just can't remember!
Growing old is no fun at all!
———————————————
Oh, [Link]! Didja hear?
———————————————
They're selling a slingshot at the
store right now! A SLINGSHOT!
———————————————
I wonder how powerful it is... I...
I need... I must try it...
———————————————
Talo, if you and Malo want it so
badly, just buy it at my parents'
shop!
———————————————
Do you see any Rupees in my
hand? I can't afford that thing!
C'mon, Beth, can't you just loan it
to us for a while?
———————————————
You know I'd get in trouble for
that! If you two want it, save up
your allowances or something.
———————————————
But...our allowances are terrible... Aww, I
wish I was born into a family with a
slingshot instead of one with a waterwheel...
———————————————
C'mon, Beth. We just want to LOOK
at it a little! So can you get it?
The slingshot? From the shop?
———————————————
...Yeah, and if you can't do that, let's just
trade families, OK?
———————————————
KNOCK IT OFF!
———————————————
[Link] has a slingshot!
WHOA!
———————————————
Wow! You had enough money to
buy it, [Link]?
———————————————
Hey, we've been waiting for you,
y'know, [Link].
———————————————
Yesterday was soooo much fun!
Yeah, chasing that monkey was
great!
———————————————
I was just telling Malo here about
how we wanted to show it to him,
but we let it go instead!
———————————————
Oh, YOU didn't get caught, Talo?
———————————————
Oh! Colin!
———————————————
Way to spoil everything by telling
your dad. Nice job.
———————————————
Yeah, thanks a lot! We got scolded by
our dad something awful. I thought
it was never gonna end...
———————————————
I bet you're trying to go see Ilia,
aren't you? Well, there's no way
I'm gonna let you pass!
———————————————
Oh, hey, neat! [Link]!
Lemme borrow that wooden sword!
———————————————
If I'd had that wooden sword
yesterday, I could've handled it all
alone, definitely!
———————————————
C'mon! Let me borrow that wooden
sword right now!
———————————————
What?! Why not? It's OK! Just
lemme borrow it!
———————————————
Look, we're never gonna let you
leave here until you tell us we can
borrow it, [Link]!
———————————————
If you wanna get past here, Colin,
you'd better start talking, fast.
Make [Link] let us borrow
that sword.
———————————————
Sheesh, you ARE my brother, Talo...
but that's pretty low...
———————————————
Come on, be a pal, [Link]!
I'll take real good care of it, so
lemme borrow your wooden sword!
———————————————
What?! Why not? Aw, I thought for
sure you were gonna let me borrow
it.
———————————————
Colin! Start asking him to lemme
borrow it, will ya?
———————————————
I still don't understand that logic...
———————————————
I'll be real careful when I use it, so
c'mon! Lemme borrow your wooden
sword!
———————————————
Gee, I thought for sure you'd
lemme borrow it this time. Well,
I guess neither of us is going
anywhere.
———————————————
Where are you going?! You gotta
teach me how to use the sword!
———————————————
Preparations complete...
———————————————
OK, wow, this is great! Let's see
how powerful that slingshot is!
Hit the targets AND those
scarecrows!
———————————————
I can't believe you two brats are
so obsessed about this. It just
shows what little boys you both
still are.
———————————————
These two idiots will never shut up
about it, so I guess you'll just have
to show them, [Link].
———————————————
Gee... You hit it, but it didn't
break...
———————————————
[Link]! If you can't damage
the body, then aim for the face!
The FACE!
———————————————
......
———————————————
Whoa! You hit it! You hit it!
———————————————
I looked at the manual in the store,
and it said that it's easier to hit
nearby targets if you press [L] when
you're aiming.
———————————————
I thought you weren't interested,
Beth...
———————————————
That's amazing, [Link]!
———————————————
The slingshot manual said that it's
easier to hit things if you hold [L]
while you aim it!
———————————————
Did you call US obsessed with this
thing? You're the one memorizing
the manual...
———————————————
Whoa! Amazing, [Link]!
———————————————
What's wrong, [Link]?
———————————————
I'm pretty sure you use [+][v] to
choose the slingshot and then you
just use it with [Y] or [X] after you
set it.
———————————————
Hurry, shoot so we can see it...
———————————————
There's still some left! Hurry!
Hurry!
———————————————
The slingshot manual SAYS to use
[L] to aim at close stuff so you
won't miss it.
———————————————
...You know too much.
———————————————
There are still targets left!
———————————————
There are five in all!
———————————————
Look around and use your brain...
———————————————
[Link]! You're so close!
———————————————
Whoa, wait! Are you going
somewhere, [Link]?
———————————————
These two are obsessed with your
slingshot. They won't shut up
about it, so can't you show it to
them, pretty please?
———————————————
......
———————————————
Not that I know this for SURE, but
I bet if you're out of pellets, you
can use plain old pumpkin seeds.
———————————————
That's it, Beth... Enough lies. You HAVE to
have used the slingshot before. Admit it!
———————————————
Preparations...complete...
———————————————
This time you have to hit the
targets and the scarecrow so we
can see how powerful that thing is!
———————————————
These two are just obsessed with
that slingshot. Which makes
sense, since they're just little
immature boys.
———————————————
They'll never shut up about it,
[Link], so just show them.
———————————————
You hit it, but I guess you just
can't break it...
———————————————
That's why you have to shoot the
face! The FACE!
———————————————
......
———————————————
Whoa! You hit it again!
———————————————
It's easier to hit stuff nearby if you
use [L] to aim...
———————————————
Let me guess, that's what it said in
the manual, right, Beth?
———————————————
Amazing!
———————————————
Slingshots are always easier to aim
if you make proper use of [L].
That's what the manual...
———————————————
Enough already.
———————————————
Hurry up and show us!
———————————————
I can teach you how to use it...
———————————————
First you use [+][v] to choose the
slingshot, then you just set it to
and use it with [Y] or [X]!
———————————————
There's still some left...
———————————————
You have to use [L] to aim at close
targets if you don't want to miss!
———————————————
Beth, admit it. You've used this thing
before.
———————————————
Hey! Are you going somewhere
again, [Link]?
———————————————
These two won't let up until you
show it to them, [Link].
———————————————
Set it to [Y] or [X]... Use pumpkin
seeds as pellets... Aim with [L]...
Beth has done this before...
———————————————
OK! This time, you have to get to
the end, [Link]!
———————————————
Ooh, he's gonna show it to us!
You're so sweet, [Link]!
———————————————
Whoa! YESSS!
———————————————
With this thing...
———————————————
I'll show 'em!
———————————————
Hyahh! Thanks, [Link]!
———————————————
...They went that way.
———————————————
The rest is up to you,
[Link]...
———————————————
Human legs...too slow to catch
monkeys...
———————————————
...They're late... Still haven't come
back from the woods...
———————————————
...Hungry...
———————————————
Wait a while... If they don't come
back... Let's leave them and go
home and eat...
———————————————
...You can't talk to a scarecrow.
———————————————
Did it hurt, buddy?
———————————————
Poor guy...
———————————————
I was watching you,
[Link]...
———————————————
Yeah, I was throwing rocks, too...
I just wasn't as successful as you...
———————————————
Good job... You knocked the nest
down!
———————————————
Ah...
———————————————
You bought the slingshot, I see.
Thanks, m'boy.
———————————————
I was watching you...
———————————————
Haaack... [Link]...
You got...stung, too?
———————————————
It's good, though...haaaff...that
you...knocked down the nest...
———————————————
Ow... Bee stings hurt...
———————————————
But you're OK, [Link]...
You knocked down the nest...
———————————————
You off to work at this hour,
[Link]? Wow, rough...
———————————————
I just got back from restocking,
myself...
———————————————
And all our new products are for
boys, so Beth was none too
happy...
———————————————
But what can I do? It's mostly
boys in this town.
———————————————
It's hard to have a daughter,
[Link]...
———————————————
I swear, she gets to be more like
my wife every day. Let's just hope
it stops before it's too late, you
know what I mean?
———————————————
Hey, m'boy, I'm sorry for dumping
my troubles on you as you head
out to work...
———————————————
You should come by and see our
new products tomorrow...
———————————————
Maybe I... Koff! Maybe I should
practice...haaack...grass-whistling
too...
———————————————
I wasn't able to knock that nest
down yesterday, after all...
I'm gonna keep at it today...
———————————————
Our cat hasn't come home since
yesterday, so the wife's in a bad
mood. At the very least, I need to
bring something home to her...
———————————————
Well hey, 'morning, [Link].
Got a day off from work today,
m'boy?
———————————————
Not me. The wife's been hassling
me... Today's the day to restock
our store.
———————————————
Look! See that? Up in that tree...
You can get a better view by tilting
[C][v] and then using [o] to look
around, just by the way.
———————————————
Yeah, some Ordon bees built
themselves a fine nest up there,
and I was thinking about knocking
it down...
———————————————
But it's so high up... I wonder
what I should do...
———————————————
That's dangerous, [Link]...
———————————————
I'm telling you, you climb up there,
those bees are going to get
perturbed, m'boy...
———————————————
So, uh, you got the day off from
work today, [Link]?
———————————————
Not me. The wife's been hassling
me... Today's restocking day at the
shop, see.
———————————————
But I was thinking I might try to
knock down the nest of those
Ordon bees that attacked you,
[Link]...
———————————————
But it's so high up... I wonder what
I should do...
———————————————
There's got to be a way to knock
it down from a distance...
———————————————
It's pretty high up... I wonder what
I should do...
———————————————
I want to knock that nest down so I
can get the bee larva inside!
———————————————
The wife's in a bad mood today...
so I don't want to do anything that
would make her even angrier...
———————————————
...[sfx]Huh?
———————————————
Well hey, [Link]. Got the
day off from work today?
———————————————
Not me. The wife's hassling me...
Today's restocking day at the
store, see.
———————————————
Look... See that? Up in that tree...
You can get a better view by tilting
[C][v] and then using [o] to look
around, just by the way.
———————————————
I'm thinking of knocking down that
nest of Ordon bees...
———————————————
That's dangerous, [Link]...
———————————————
I'm telling you, you climb up there,
those bees are going to get
perturbed, m'boy...
———————————————
So, uh, you got the day off from
work today, [Link]?
———————————————
Not me. The wife's been hassling
me... Today's restocking day at the
shop, see.
———————————————
But I was thinking I might try to
knock down the nest of those
Ordon bees that attacked you,
[Link]...
———————————————
I want to knock that nest down so I
can get the bee larva inside!
———————————————
The wife's in a bad mood today...
so I don't want to do anything that
would make her even angrier...
———————————————
...[sfx]Huh?
———————————————
Oh! Sorry! Sorry! Didn't realize it
was you, [Link].
———————————————
I was thinking maybe I could knock
it down by throwing rocks at it...
———————————————
But, of course, it's so high up...
It makes that pretty hard to do...
———————————————
So, I was thinking maybe I could
knock it down from here...
———————————————
EEEEEK! AAAAACK! OUCH! ...Ow.
They don't hold back with the
stinging, do they?!
———————————————
I guess...rocks won't work...
Hack! Haff!
———————————————
How would YOU try to knock it
down, [Link]?
———————————————
Can't you think of anything at all?
Hooof! Haaff!
———————————————
That hurts... Ow...
———————————————
If rocks won't work, then what am I
supposed to do?
———————————————
[Link]...I saw all that.
———————————————
Calling down a hawk... Why didn't
I think of that?!
———————————————
I was thinking of trying to knock
that down myself, but you beat me
to the punch, m'boy.
———————————————
I was trying to knock that down
myself, but you beat me to it,
m'boy.
———————————————
Knocking that bee's nest down
must mean you're after it too,
aren't you, [Link]?
———————————————
You're gonna put that bee larva
into an empty bottle and keep it,
am I right, m'boy?
———————————————
Must be nice...
———————————————
Must be nice... Having bee larva...
———————————————
Owww... Using a hawk... Brilliant...
———————————————
Maybe I'll start practicing my grass
whistle...
———————————————
I saw all that...
———————————————
Using a hawk... That's brilliant...
Hafff! Hoork!
———————————————
Using a hawk to knock it down...
I could never do that... Hofff!
———————————————
Oh! Bee larva!
———————————————
Must be nice...
———————————————
Oh... [Link].
———————————————
Owww... Sorry about my face...
The swelling won't go down...
———————————————
Oh, I heard you're going out on an
errand for the mayor, m'boy.
———————————————
Must be nice... Me, I'm restocking
again today...
———————————————
Today I REALLY need to find
something to bring back to sell at
the shop...
———————————————
The wife's in a nasty mood today,
so I don't want to disappoint her
again. That'd be...bad.
———————————————
Oh... [Link]...
———————————————
I hear you're leaving on an errand
for the mayor today... Must be
nice... Going on errands...
———————————————
Me, I'm restocking the store again
today...
———————————————
I tell you, I wouldn't object to
going to a bigger town to find stuff
there I can sell...
———————————————
But the wife would never let me do
anything like that...
———————————————
Today I REALLY have to bring back
something we can sell at the
store...
———————————————
The wife's in a ferocious mood
today, so I don't want to disappoint
her again. That'd be...not good.
———————————————
Thanks for buying that slingshot
yesterday, m'boy.
———————————————
It really cheered the wife up, which
helped me out.
———————————————
...Huh?
———————————————
Oh! [Link]. I hear you're
leaving today.
———————————————
Must be nice, going places...
The wife's been hassling me, so I
have to restock our store today...
———————————————
I never managed to knock that
bee's nest down yesterday...
I'm going to try again today.
———————————————
My wife is in a brutal mood today,
so I don't want to disappoint her
again. That'd be...a bad thing.
———————————————
Anyway, is it true you're leaving
today, [Link]?
———————————————
Well, here's hoping it's a good
experience, [Link].
———————————————
I bet you climbed those vines and
got stung by the bees yesterday,
too, didn't you...
———————————————
Our cat hasn't come home since
yesterday, so the wife's been in an
awful mood... I don't want to make
her even angrier...
———————————————
WHOA!
———————————————
Mon-MONSTER!
———————————————
You've returned for more, haven't
you?!
———————————————
My... My daughter... Return her!



And TAKE THIS!
———————————————
[Link]... You've come back
to us?
———————————————
Have you heard? The children...
———————————————
Those poor children... They were
taken by monsters...
———————————————
I'd forgotten how quiet the village
is without them...
———————————————
The children... By now the
monsters must have...
———————————————
Oh, Beth... Daddy's so sorry...
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
The... The children are ALIVE?!
———————————————
Wh-What? They're alive!
———————————————
This is fantastic! Truly fantastic!
———————————————
Oh, thank you for letting me know,
[Link]!
———————————————
Have you told all of the others yet?
———————————————
If you haven't, you must spread the
word. Put their worst fears to rest!
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
I heard you saved the children...
———————————————
Thank you so much!
———————————————
There hasn't been any change in
my little Beth...has there?
———————————————
She's my only daughter. I've been
so worried about her, you know.
So, so worried...
———————————————
The time has come!
———————————————
Well, [Link]...
———————————————
Can I at least interest you in one
serious sword lesson once you
return from Hyrule?
———————————————
You have talent with a blade. If you
were to get proper instruction,
I bet you could be a very skilled
swordsman.
———————————————
You can let me know once you
return, but I want you to give it
some serious consideration...
———————————————
For now, put this village out of
your thoughts and leave things to
me.
———————————————
Ah, just in time, [Link]!
I just delivered something to your
room!
———————————————
Oh, I see you got the fishing rod.
Colin will be pleased. And it works
better than you would think, right?
———————————————
Well, have a good one...
———————————————
Ah!
———————————————
Beast! I have found you!
———————————————
Foul BEAST!
———————————————
Ah, great timing, [Link]!
There was something I had
forgotten to tell you.
———————————————
My son Colin is making a fishing
rod so the two of you can play
together.
———————————————
He should finish it today, so you
come get it at the house tomorrow.
———————————————
Now, it is Colin's first fishing rod,
so it may not be the best one out
there...but you will be kind and use
it anyway, right?
———————————————
See you tomorrow!
———————————————
Mmm... Uli... Monsters... They...
My sword... They...
———————————————
Mmm... Monsters... Be... Be...
Begone... Begone...
———————————————
What was that sound?!
———————————————
The children could not have
returned...could they?
———————————————
I must go out and search one last
time. You get inside the house.
———————————————
I have placed the sword that was to
be our gift to Hyrule on the couch.
If the mayor comes for it, please
give it to him.
———————————————
But, darling...your injuries!
———————————————
AAAGH!
———————————————
Uh... Uhnnn...
———————————————
Hi, [Link]... You have the
day off work today, right?
———————————————
So...I finished the fishing rod I was
making.
———————————————
It's also the first day off in a while
for [Epona], right? She must
be happy...
———————————————
You have the day off from work,
don't you, [Link]?
You have to give [Epona] a
day off, too. Poor girl...
———————————————
Why don't you let [Epona]
take the day off, too!
———————————————
Everyone went into the woods...
I wonder if they're OK...
———————————————
Where'd everyone go off to?
———————————————
[Epona] looks nervous...
I think something about the woods
is bothering her.
———————————————
I hope everyone is all right...
———————————————
I've never seen [Epona] this
upset. Do you think she's trying to
tell us something?
———————————————
Talo still hasn't come back...
———————————————
Didn't you see him, [Link]?
———————————————
Where could Talo have gone?
———————————————
......[Link], are you going
to see Ilia?
———————————————
Maybe it's just me...but those guys
don't normally let people through...
———————————————
Um, [Link], you think...
You think we can go to see Ilia
together?
———————————————
[Link]... C'mon, let's go...
———————————————
Oh! [Link]!
———————————————
Let's go see Ilia together.
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
Thanks...
———————————————
Those guys are always teasing me...
———————————————
What's so fun about swinging
something like that around,
anyway? I hate it... It's scary...
———————————————
But when I grow up, I'm gonna be
just like you, [Link]!
———————————————
I don't want to learn about swords
or anything, but could you teach
me how to ride a horse sometime?
———————————————
Can you?! You have to promise!
———————————————
Oh, you got it... I hope you like it...
———————————————
Aren't you off of work today,
[Link]?
———————————————
[Epona] finally has a day off,
too...
———————————————
[Link], I figured I'd give it
to you first thing in the morning,
but...
———————————————
My dad said, "You just wait until
[Link] comes to get it!"
So I didn't bring it to you...
———————————————
[Link], my mom has the
fishing rod I made for you. Aww, I
wish I'd brought it with me...
———————————————
Oh... Hi, [Link].
———————————————
I'm making you a fishing rod,
y'know! 
———————————————
All I have left to do is paint it,
so get ready for fishing!
———————————————
I just need to finish painting it
today...
———————————————
Then I need my dad to look it
over...
———————————————
My dad, he always has to stick his
nose in everything, y'know...
———————————————
[Link]...!
———————————————
Oh... At last, a pleasant surprise!
You are safe, at least...
———————————————
The silence of this village... Does it
not chill you as it does me?
———————————————
While you were gone, we were set
upon by evil creatures...
———————————————
I suppose you have already heard...
but the children and poor Ilia...
They were taken...
———————————————
We were all worried that perhaps
you had been taken, as well...
———————————————
Oh, but... I am sorry... As much as
I would like to give these tidings
to my husband...
———————————————
He has just fallen asleep...
———————————————
But it truly is a fine thing to see
you return.
———————————————
I am sure everyone would be
pleased to see you if you were
to stop in and say hello!
———————————————
Um... [Link]...
———————————————
Everyone will return...won't they?
———————————————
I am sorry... I must believe... If we
do not believe, then our children
are as good as lost already...
———————————————
Yes, all will be fine. After all, you
have returned to us, and that is a
fair thing.
———————————————
I believe that everyone will return
safely...
———————————————
Oh... Are you going already?
———————————————
Yes, I suppose you have only just
returned, so things must be very
hard on you, as well...
———————————————
Oh... [Link]... That sword...
———————————————
That belongs to my husband...does
it not?
———————————————
How wonderful!
———————————————
The evil creatures stole it from
Rusl...but you... You got it back?!
———————————————
I know it is safe in your hands...
And you need it now, yes? Please
keep using it, [Link].
———————————————
Well, [Link]... I hope you
will return again to show me your
shining face. It does my heart
good to see you well.
———————————————
And about the sword... I will tell my
husband later.
———————————————
Once he knows you have it, I am
sure he will be relieved!
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
I heard you were safe and sound.
———————————————
It relieves me so to see that you
are hale and hearty!
———————————————
Oh... Your face has lost its usual
color... Things must be very hard
on you, as well...
———————————————
Oh!
———————————————
Colin... Colin is...alive?!
———————————————
Oh! The children are all safe!
Oh, how wonderful! I am so glad
I kept the faith...
———————————————
My thanks to you, [Link].
From the bottom of my heart.
———————————————
Have you told everyone else yet?
You must tell them all!
———————————————
I wish I could tell my husband,
as well...
———————————————
But he is gone... He left town to
search for the children.
———————————————
The moment his wounds healed,
he left to find those young ones.
———————————————
Hopefully he will stop by Kakariko
Village...
———————————————
I do not know his whereabouts,
so it may not reach him...
———————————————
I will try to send him a letter with
this fine news.
———————————————
Oh, I must write one to Colin, too!
———————————————
Yes... Since my husband is not
here right now, would you take it
for me?
———————————————
Oh, [Link]!
———————————————
I have heard! They said you saved
the children!
———————————————
Oh, my thanks to you! From the
bottom of my heart!
———————————————
I have never seen your face look so
tired... It must have been quite
hard on you...
———————————————
But even so, I am relieved to see
that you, too, are safe and doing
well!
———————————————
And it is true the children are in
Kakariko Village?
———————————————
I would like to send a letter to my
husband to let him know, but I do
not know his whereabouts, so I
wonder if it will reach him...
———————————————
Do you get to Kakariko Village
much, [Link]? 
———————————————
How has my boy been? Is Colin
doing well?
———————————————
I sent him a letter, but I have yet
to get a reply...
———————————————
I wonder if it will be long before I
get a reply from Colin...
———————————————
Since I have not gotten a letter,
it must mean he is busy and doing
all right, does it not?
———————————————
Yes... His father is not here right
now, so you take it, please.
———————————————
I received a letter from Colin!
———————————————
It is doubtful he will be back
anytime soon, but he is working
hard in Kakariko Village, and I
should not worry...or so he says.
———————————————
I thought that boy would be so
homesick that he would be crying
himself to sleep every night!
———————————————
But he has grown up so suddenly...
It helps me rest easy, but at the
same time it makes me miss him
all the more.
———————————————
I have received word from my
husband, who had gone to look for
the children. Yes, he has caught up
with them!
———————————————
I will just wait here and guard our
homestead with this little one until
everyone returns.
———————————————
So, please let both Colin and my
husband know that they need not
worry about me.
———————————————
I am so happy that everyone is
safe...
———————————————
And you... You have really grown to
become an impressive swordsman
over time...

Talo and Malo went chasing like
crazy people after that monkey.
———————————————
I can't keep up with those two...
———————————————
[Link], you should chase
after them on [Epona]!
———————————————
[Link], did you find Talo?
———————————————
Sounds like the monkeys caught
him, not the other way around!
———————————————
Maybe I'll just go home...
———————————————
[Link]! Hello again!
———————————————
Ooh! Ooh! You're going to Hyrule
Castle, aren't you, [Link]?
———————————————
That must be sooooo nice... I want
to go to Hyrule, too!
———————————————
I mean, there's nothing that looks
good on me in this town...
———————————————
Come back soon, [Link]!
———————————————
When you get back, you have to tell
me all about Castle Town!
———————————————
Hello, [Link]!
———————————————
Hey, guess what? My dad just got
back from buying new inventory
for the store...
———————————————
...And it's all stuff for boys! I told
him to get some cute girly stuff,
but he didn't listen!
———————————————
I can't believe it! He ALWAYS gets
boy stuff! Rats!
———————————————
So I told him I'm not going to help
out in the store anymore! Not until
he gets some stuff for girls!
———————————————
I just feel bad for my mom, always
cooped up in there with that
silly boy junk...
———————————————
C'mon, Dad! You can't catch a silly
little monkey?
———————————————
Uhh... Well... No. No, I can't.
———————————————
Well... Have a good time at work,
[Link]!
———————————————
...And be careful out there!
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
If you came to take [Epona]
back, you can FORGET it!
———————————————
Why don't you think about what
you've done for a change! I won't
open the gate until you change
your attitude!
———————————————
Ilia, you don't know what happened
yesterday...
———————————————
Listen, I don't know if she'll listen
to me, but let me try to explain
about Talo and the monkey, OK?
———————————————
You crawl in here through the
tunnel in back while I do,
[Link].
———————————————
Give up! I don't care how long you
wait there, I'm not letting you take
[Epona]!
———————————————
You know how to get in here, right?
Go around through the tunnel in
the woods while you can. Hurry
up, [Link]!
———————————————
I'll talk to her in the meantime...
———————————————
[Epona] is a girl too, so you
have to treat her nice like one!
———————————————
Oh, but listen, [Link]...
Could you do something for me?
———————————————
Can you use a piece of grass to
play that song for me? You know,
the one that [Epona] likes?
———————————————
I tried to play it for [Epona],
but I just can't seem to play it
the way you can, [Link].
———————————————
It's such a nice melody...
———————————————
[Epona] looks happy.
———————————————
Well, she's all prettied up now, so
I suppose you can ride her back.
But don't you make her do too
much, OK?
———————————————
What's the matter? Aren't you
going to help out at the ranch?
———————————————
Oh, that's such a nice melody...
I understand why [Epona]
likes it.
———————————————
But really...it's because you play it
for her that makes it so sweet.
———————————————
I'll clean her up right away.
———————————————
I'll clean her up right away.
———————————————
Um, [Link], after this...
You'll play [Epona]'s favorite
song on a piece of grass, right?
———————————————
I tried to play it for her...but I just
couldn't seem to play it the way
you do, [Link].
———————————————
Now remember, [Link]...
Don't you push [Epona] too
hard...
———————————————
Oh. [Link].
———————————————
Looks like you're goin' to help
Fado. Good job.
———————————————
He headed up to the ranch ahead
of you.
———————————————
You go finish up your chores
before the sun goes down.
———————————————
Go on. Climb up on [Epona]
and get goin'.
———————————————
If you don't hurry, the sun'll go
down.
———————————————
Hmm... You goin' to help out Fado
or not, [Link]?
———————————————
He headed up to the ranch already.
———————————————
You'd better move along and take
[Epona] with you.
———————————————
Go on. Get up to the ranch and
help out.
———————————————
Get going. Hurry and ride
[Epona] up to the ranch so
you can help out!
———————————————
But... What's the matter? You
don't look so good!
———————————————
[Link]... You're awful
tired, eh?
———————————————
When you're bushed, you ought to
eat a pumpkin to replenish your
energy, 'cause they're
chock-full of nutrients.
———————————————
Besides, you know the old saying:
"You can't go to war on an empty
stomach!" ...Or somethin' like that,
I forget the exact wordin'.
———————————————
[Link], you look real tired.
———————————————
You ought to go eat some pumpkin.
That'll give you more energy...
———————————————
You may be young, but you can't
ignore fatigue, sonny. It could
mean your life one day.
———————————————
When I was watchin' you tryin' to
stop those goats, I could tell you
had no strength in your belly.
———————————————
Even if you press [A] to grab on, if
you don't put some power into it
and tilt [+][v], you'll never wrestle
the goat down!
———————————————
I came to it, as we discussed.
———————————————
I checked, as we discussed.
———————————————
H-Hey... Did the monsters leave?
———————————————
H-Hey... Did the monsters leave?
———————————————
Oh! About the shield...
———————————————
Hey! Not so loud...
———————————————
Mornin', [Link].
———————————————
Oh, hey, [Link]!
———————————————
Sounds like Fado's handlin' things
at the ranch on his own today.
———————————————
When he's up there alone, I always
figure some calamity or other's
gonna happen...
———————————————
WHOOOOOOOAAA!
A GOAT GOT LOOSE!
———————————————
IT'S HEADIN' FOR TOWN!
SOMEBODY STOP IT!
———————————————
WHOOOOOOAAA!
'NOTHER LOOSE GOAT!
———————————————
SOMEBODY STOP IT!
———————————————
Argh! The town's precious
livestock...
———————————————
THAT's why I'm uneasy about
leavin' the ranch in Fado's hands...
———————————————
At the very least, can you stop
the goats from gettin' loose
while you're here...
———————————————
Argh... Another one of the town's
precious livestock...
———————————————
[Link]... Next time, you
need to set your feet by holdin'
down [A] and grabbin' that critter...
———————————————
Aw... Fado did it again...
———————————————
Sorry 'bout that, [Link].
But thanks to you, that goat didn't
get away!
———————————————
That Fado... Looks like I'll be
garnishin' the cost of that goat
from his wages!
———————————————
The goats are gettin' out, the
monkeys are causin' trouble...
It's tough bein' mayor!
———————————————
The goats are gettin' loose, the
monkeys are causin' trouble...
It's tough bein' mayor!
———————————————
You've heard 'bout 'em, right,
[Link]? Those monkeys?
Apparently they've been comin'
into the village lately.
———————————————
If you see 'em causin' any trouble,
can you teach 'em a lesson for me?
———————————————
I've gotta wonder, what are wild
monkeys doin' in town? Did the
woods run out of food?
———————————————
At any rate, if you see 'em causin'
any trouble, could you teach 'em a
lesson for me?
———————————————
Eh? Oh, did you need Ilia for
somethin'?
———————————————
Sorry, sonny, but I was told that if
you came by today, I wasn't to let
you inside.
———————————————
She's locked herself in her room,
workin' like crazy on somethin' or
other...
———————————————
Sorry, sonny...but Ilia told me not
to let you in today.
———————————————
She'll be awful sore at me if I break
my word.
———————————————
She's the spittin' image of her late
mother, that girl... Right down to
her strong will...
———————————————
What's a father to do...
———————————————
There's no way you'll be able to
deliver our town's gift without
[Epona]...
———————————————
If you plant your feet while
grabbin' it with [A], you'll calm that
goat down real quick.
———————————————
If any more goats get loose, you be
sure to grab 'em like that...
———————————————
Argh... That Fado... Doin' it again
today!
———————————————
Sorry to always be puttin' you
through this, [Link].
———————————————
Well... You'd better get goin' and
figure out what you're gonna do
about [Epona].
———————————————
Maybe you can head up to where
Ilia is and see if she won't give the
horse back.
———————————————
[Link], can't you find a way
to get her to give back
[Epona]?
———————————————
These goats have been awful
skittish lately... You always gotta
be on your toes!
———————————————
HEY! [Link]!
STAMPEDIN' GOAT!
———————————————
STOP IT!
———————————————
HEY! [Link]!
'NOTHER GOAT COMIN'!
———————————————
STOP IT THIS TIME!
———————————————
[Link]! I heard!
———————————————
Sounds like everyone's over in
Kakariko!
———————————————
An' everyone in town who'd been
all down in the mouth, they're all
finally startin' to feel their oats
again!
———————————————
An' it's all 'cause of you, bud!
Thanks a ton...
———————————————
You leave these scamps to me.
I'll manage without y'all somehow!
———————————————
Besides, [Link], c'mon...
Can't you find a way to get Ilia and
the tots back here just a hair
quicker?
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
N-No foolin'?! The tots are safe?!
———————————————
An' on top of that, they're all in
Kakariko Village?!
———————————————
Aw, shucks, you don't need to
worry 'bout that now.
———————————————
You're incredible, bud! I can
already see everybody's smilin'
faces!
———————————————
Does everyone know already?
Did y'all tell the tots' parents?
———————————————
If you ain't done it yet, you better
clear out an' get to it!
———————————————
[Link]! Bud! Where'd you
get them duds?
———————————————
So... Still in one piece, huh? 
Good to hear it!
———————————————
Hoo, bud, we went through a rough
time while you were gone. Yeah!
Beasts showed up an' attacked the
village!
———————————————
They didn't do much damage to
the buildings...but the tots...
They took the young tots...
———————————————
Ilia's gone missin', too... They
probably...got her, too...
———————————————
Hey, [Link]!
———————————————
If you're runnin' around out there,
you gotta go find them tots!
———————————————
Rusl had a go-round with the
monsters that took the tots, but he
took a beatin' doin' it...
———————————————
An' the mayor's gone lookin', but
he's all alone...and old...
———————————————
That's why we need you, see?
———————————————
You leave the ranch to me, now!
You go find them tots!
———————————————
It's a good thing I was able to wrap
early today thanks to you helpin'
me out, bud.
———————————————
Thanks a ton, [Link].
———————————————
Well, hey there, [Link]!
Brought [Epona], huh?
———————————————
Well, how's about it? Wanna round
them goats up for the first time in
a dog's age?
———————————————
I'll give y'all something nice if you
finish quick! Can I count on ya?
———————————————
I bet these scamps are sure happy
to see you!
———————————————
[.]Sure thing!
[.]Sorry, partner.
———————————————
Aw... Well, I guess it can't be
helped, what with you havin' a lot
on your plate these days.
———————————————
I'll find a way to manage things
here at the ranch without y'all.
You do what you gotta do to take
care of the village!
———————————————
Great! Then I'll leave it to you two
today!
———————————————
It ain't like you to quit in the
middle of a job...
———————————————
But I reckon it can't be helped,
what with all that's on your plate
these days...
———————————————
I'll find a way to manage the rest
on my own. Y'all go on and don't
worry about me none!
———————————————
Well, in that case, hurry up and
herd them goats into the barn.
———————————————
What's the story, [Link]?
It ain't like you to take [var].
———————————————
But still, thanks to you, I did wrap
things up early. Much obliged!
———————————————
Hoo, way to ride, [Link]!
You wrapped that up in just
[var]!
———————————————
Thanks to you, I wrapped things up
a mite earlier today!
———————————————
Much obliged, bud!
———————————————
Hey, as promised, here's a little
healthy gift for y'all. Good luck out
there, bud!
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern Oil  20 Rupees
You need this fuel to light your
lantern, so it's best to keep some
handy, m'dear.
———————————————
[ 8C]Bottle (1 Milk Serving) 50 Rupees
Today's special! There's no need to
return the empty bottle.
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk  10 Rupees
A quick gulp of this fresh milk will
replenish your life energy and wash
away fatigue, m'dear!
———————————————

[ 8C]Sold Out
———————————————

[ 8C]Sold Out
———————————————
[ 8C]Red Potion  15 Rupees
I hear this healing potion is all the
rage in Hyrule... My girl would NOT
shut up about it, so I ordered it.
———————————————
[ 8C]Bee Larva (10)  10 Rupees
That's used as fishing bait, m'dear.
You can store it in an empty bottle
if you've got one.
———————————————
[ 8C]Slingshot & 50 Pellets  30 Rupees
I got this in for the kids. It's just a
toy, but it stings something AWFUL
when you get hit by it!
———————————————
Oh, you want [ 8C]bee larva, do you?
Then bring me an empty bottle!
———————————————
I can pack some [ 8C]bee larva into your
bottle for just 10 Rupees. Would
you like to buy some, m'dear?
———————————————
Then into your bottle it goes!
———————————————
[ 8C]Bee larva are 10 Rupees. If you
want some, bring some money with
you, all right, m'dear?
———————————————
The [ 8C]slingshot is 30 Rupees. If you
want it, bring some money with
you, all right, m'dear?
———————————————
The [ 8C]slingshot is 30 Rupees.
Do you want to buy it, m'dear?
———————————————
What are you doing buying a
slingshot, you naughty thing?
You're too old for toys! Will you at
least let the kids play with it?
———————————————
Oh, I should tell you, if you happen
to run out of pellets, you can also
use pumpkin seeds.
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees. Do you
want some, m'dear?
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees. If you
want some, you'd better bring
some money with you.
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees, but your
lantern is full, and you don't have
an empty bottle to store it in, so
there's no place for me to put it!
———————————————
All right. I'll put it in your lantern,
then.
———————————————
All right. I'll put it in your empty bottle,
then.
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees. Do you
want to buy some?
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees.
The price of oil has been going up
so much lately... I'm sorry. This is
the cheapest I can offer it.
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees, but your
lantern is full, and you don't have
an empty bottle to store it in.
There's no place for me to put it...
———————————————
All right. I'll put it in your lantern,
then.
———————————————
All right. I'll put it in your empty bottle,
then.
———————————————
What's the matter? If you're
shopping, look around with [+][>]...
———————————————
Thanks, m'dear. See you later...
———————————————
Oh... If you see my cat,
[Link], please return him...
———————————————
See you again soon!
———————————————
...That's sold out, m'dear. I imagine
you could tell...
———————————————
Oh, stop it! That's sold out!
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk is 10 Rupees. I'll fill your
bottle with it, if you like. Would
you like some, m'dear?
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk is 10 Rupees! If you want
some, you'd better bring some
money with you!
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk is 10 Rupees, but if you don't
have an empty bottle or something
to put it in, I can't sell it to you,
m'dear.
———————————————
All right! Then I'll fill your bottle.
———————————————
Didn't see anything you liked?
———————————————
Don't gawk at me! Use [+][>] to look
at the goods we have for sale!
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk is 10 Rupees, but you can't
buy any if you don't have an
empty bottle...
———————————————
Hmm... You don't have an empty
bottle, m'dear?
———————————————
Ah well... Next is your sword.
I have faith in your senses!
———————————————
Boy, you sure are thick!
———————————————
The land in that direction is
covered in twilight! Only someone
FROM the twilight can put you
BACK in the twilight!
———————————————
So if you want to go back in there,
you have to do as I say and go find
a sword and shield somewhere.
———————————————
Come on! How many times do I
have to tell you?
———————————————
If you want to get back into the
twilit Hyrule, you need to bring
back both a shield and a sword.
———————————————
So, um, what next?
———————————————
Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Did you think I'd disappeared?
———————————————
Listen, there's another thing I
forgot to tell you... Don't think you
can just run off and save your
friends, because you can't.
———————————————
Just beyond that bridge, the land
is covered in twilight.


Last time, a shadow beast pulled
you through the curtain of
twilight...

But if you want to go that way this
time, you'll need the cooperation
of someone FROM the twilight...
like me!
———————————————
So you really have no choice but
to do what I say.
———————————————
Saving your friends and all that...
Well, that'll depend on your
actions...
———————————————
Because you never can trust words,
you know.
———————————————
Right now, I want a sword and
shield that'll suit me.
———————————————
You do understand me, don't you?
[sfx]Eee hee hee!


So, what do you plan to do? While
you're here dawdling, the twilight
continues to expand.

Come on! Hurry it up!
———————————————
It looks...kind of cheap...
———————————————
All right, then... Next is a sword.
Hurry up and get one!
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! Found it! Found it!
———————————————
Hey! That guy up there... Don't just
ignore him! Do something!
———————————————
C'mon, let's get up on the roof
from here and scare that guy.
———————————————
Look at him...posing like he's 
all important... Wait until he sees
us! [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
You need to get some revenge on
that guy! All you have to do is
scare him a little...
———————————————
All right... So now you have a
sword. Looks like you can actually
be useful when you concentrate!
———————————————
All right... No more detours.
I'm going to take you back into the
twilight.
———————————————
Go back to the woods where you
first transformed into that shape!
———————————————
What?! You came this far, so
rather than chatting, why don't you
go get that sword?!
———————————————
What's the matter? Why don't you
at least go get that shield?
———————————————
Ooh! I bet even YOU could climb
up there!
———————————————
Got your marching orders? Look for
a sword and shield that'll suit me!
———————————————
Aw, come on! WHAT IS IT?!
Can't you just shut your trap and
go look for a sword?!
———————————————
Hey! Where are you going?
———————————————
That guy has a sword, doesn't he?
Just steal it from him!
———————————————
Watch him closely. If he lets his
guard down even for a moment,
pounce on him from behind!
———————————————
Oh, don't worry! He'll be just fine.
You jumping up on a guy isn't
going to do him any harm!
———————————————
Hey! What are you doing picking on
some poor injured guy?
———————————————
You just have to watch him
carefully. As soon as he lets his
guard down, you have to pounce!
———————————————
Just pounce on him from behind
and swipe that sword!
———————————————
Oh, don't worry! He'll be just fine.
You jumping up on a guy isn't
going to do him any harm!
———————————————
Aww... No matter how many times
we come here, this village is still
so boring!
———————————————
Hey, come on! If you're done with
your errands, there's no point in
overstaying our welcome!
———————————————
I'll be here in the shadows, rooting
you on! Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Ooh... Turned into a thief, have
you?! That's terrible! Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Now then... We've got our weapon,
so there's nothing else we need
in this backwater.
———————————————
Back to the forest we go!
———————————————
Hey! Why don't we show that guy
and his bird a little of the
hospitality they showed us!
———————————————
If we climb up on the roof from
here, you could...well...you know!
Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Don't worry. The thing that I'm
looking for is in the temple in the
Faron Woods.
———————————————
Don't be lollygagging around here.
Let's get searching for it!
———————————————
There are only two pieces of Fused
Shadow left to collect! It's time to
press on and search for them!
———————————————
Be quick! We have to get through
Faron Woods and head east to the
Eldin lands!
———————————————
We don't have time to waste here.
Let's press on!
———————————————
Look! Think we can climb up on the
roof from here, too?

———————————————


It's locked...
———————————————
Ribbit! Ribbit!
———————————————
...Wha... What? The frog croaked.
Now hop along...
———————————————
What are those guys whispering
about?
———————————————
I snuck up on them and listened
with [A], but I don't understand
much human talk.
———————————————
Maybe you should try listening to
them too!
———————————————
Were you trying to listen to the
humans talk?
———————————————
Do you understand human words?
That's amazing!
———————————————
I tried listening with [A], too, but
I didn't understand a thing.
———————————————
If you sneak up on them and try
listening, I bet you hear something
good.
———————————————
If you're too far away, you can't
hear very well, so you have to 
sneak up close to them and use [A]
to listen.
———————————————
If they're talking about food, you
be sure to tell me about it.
———————————————
Nighttime walks are so nice, aren't
they?!
———————————————
I hope I find something good
buried today! I love digging holes
and looking for treasure!
———————————————
Use your [X] senses and use [Y] to
dig where you see anything
strange. You'll dig something up!
———————————————
Did you hear something good?
Did you understand them? Do they
have any food plans?
———————————————
Were you attacked by that hawk?
You're no match for him...
———————————————
I'm sorry! That person calling the 
hawk is my master's...husband.
———————————————
You could sneak up from behind
and scare him, meow.
———————————————
If you're hurt, you should either
eat a pumpkin or use [Y] to dig and
find hearts!
———————————————
You smell the same as the ranch
hand named [Link], so I
know you're a nice wolf!
———————————————
My [X] senses are very sharp...so I
just know these things!
———————————————
You have good senses too, right?
Though [Link] doesn't
seem so good at stuff like that...
———————————————
The adults are all consumed with
thoughts of the children.
———————————————
Mrowww... Even Papa tries to do
too much, despite how very scared
he is...
———————————————
I'm bored, so I was thinking of
sneaking up on him from behind to
play a trick on him.
———————————————
Mroww, I'm so bored!
———————————————
Don't you think it would be kind of
fun to scare Papa?
———————————————
I mean, you and [Link] did
the same thing!
———————————————
He dropped me in the river in the
middle of the day...
———————————————
Mroww, but Papa was acting very
shamefully!
———————————————
But anyway, I was watching you!
———————————————
I was thinking of playing a prank
on Papa, too!
———————————————
It's so strangely fun to aggravate
Papa!
———————————————
You must be a friend of
[Link]'s!
———————————————
I was watching you, mrow!
———————————————
To humans, this must seem like
just an average country town, but
to us, it's paradise!
———————————————
You should take a good look
around this town...
———————————————
I can see stuff sparkling... Whether
or not YOU can is up to the quality
of your [X] senses.
———————————————
Were you able to see this town as 
I do? As a place sparkling with
treasure?
———————————————
You'd better take good care of
those [X] senses!
———————————————
Wait!
———————————————
I don't know what you've come
here to do, but if you're going
into town, be careful!
———————————————
THEY came and made both the
forest and the village a mess...
———————————————
They kidnapped the children from
the village...
———————————————
But you're different... You're not
a bad thing, are you?
———————————————
I can tell, because you smell like
the trees of Ordon...
———————————————
If you run into any trouble, try
talking to the animals in town.
———————————————
We animals understand one
another, so you'll be fine!
———————————————
Thank you for taking care of those
bad guys!
———————————————
They made both the village and the
forest a mess...
———————————————
They kidnapped the village
children...
———————————————
But I know...you're not one of
them.
———————————————
I can tell because you smell like
the trees of Ordon...
———————————————
If you run into any trouble, try
talking to the animals.
———————————————
We animals understand one
another, so you'll be all right!
———————————————
Whoa... You stink like the guy from
the ranch...
———————————————
You didn't...EAT him, did you?!
...Huh? You're friends?
———————————————
As long as we stay here, we're
safe...
———————————————
We were relaxing here, so we
watched the entire incident unfold
from beginning to end.
———————————————
If you want the details, go ask our
brown brother over there...
———————————————
Huh? Fresh face, huh?
———————————————
You're a sharp one to realize that
ya needed to come introduce
yourself to me!
———————————————
If ya want to know anything about
this town, I can tell ya. Whaddaya
say?
———————————————
[.]Tell me.
[.]No thanks.
———————————————
Psssh... I can see ya tell it like it
is... Lone wolf and all that...
———————————————
Let me tell ya... This is usually a
quiet little village, but there was a
bit of a ruckus today.
———————————————
If you gotta know, monsters
attacked the village and made off
with the little brats.
———————————————
...Ya look a bit like a monster
yourself.
———————————————
If ya gonna be hangin' around
town, ya may wanna stay outta
sight of the people!
———————————————
Ribbit! Ribbit!
———————————————
...I didn't think anyone would come
calling, so I haven't thought of
anything to say... Sorry...
———————————————
The town rascals used to play
around here a lot, so there's
lots of stuff buried nearby.
———————————————
If you use [Y] to dig, you may
uncover something.
———————————————
The lady who lives there is so
scatterbrained. She drops stuff
around here all the time.
———————————————
I saw the guy from the ranch here
the other day.
———————————————
I thought for sure you had made a
meal out of him, so I was surprised,
to say the least.
———————————————
It would've been nice if you'd said
for sure whether you'd eaten him
or not! I mean, really!
———————————————
Although I suppose it's good the
rascals didn't get eaten...
———————————————
On the day he came back to town...
———————————————
I wanted to congratulate him...
———————————————
Something tells me we're gonna get
eaten.
———————————————
I'm actually not from this village.
———————————————
Over near Lake Hylia there was a
terrible guy who worked us Cuccos
hard, while he grinned this
enormous, wide grin.
———————————————
I couldn't take it no more, so I
escaped and came here.
———————————————
You still got business in this town?
———————————————
If not, it's probably not a good
idea for you to just hang around.
———————————————
Both you and the villagers will just
end up angry at one another...
———————————————
Ah... To be a wolf on a night when
the moon rides high... Beautiful!
———————————————
Tell me, is your true form a human
who is not currently in the town?
...Nah! Just teasing!
———————————————
You're lucky... Your sharpened
[X] senses and your soft-looking
coat... Lovely!
———————————————
The earth in this area is so soft and
fluffy... I love this spot!
———————————————
Your hair looks soft and fluffy,
too... Now I have ANOTHER favorite
thing!
———————————————
Ahh... You're lovely... I want you to
fix me with those keen eyes and
use your [X] senses!
———————————————
Ugh... I'm getting bored with this
town...
———————————————
Rumor has it that somewhere in
Hyrule, there's an amusement
starring Cuccos who flap their
wings well. Think that's true?
———————————————
How lovely... I want to debut there!
———————————————
When you battle the Gorons, you've
gotta wear these. Then just use [A]
to grab 'em and toss 'em aside!
———————————————
[Link], you've heard of
sumo wrestlin', right? Gorons like
to match strength in sumo
contests.
Luckily for you, the basics of sumo
are the same as stoppin' chargin'
goats... You wanna hear more?
———————————————
Step forward and grab your foe
with [A]. Strike a fleein' foe with [W]
and sidestep an attackin' foe with
[<][+][>].
———————————————
For example... Answer a [W] strike
by grabbin' with [A]!
———————————————
For example, if you're about to be
grabbed, sidestep with [<][+][>].
———————————————
For example... Use [W] to strike a
foe who tries to sidestep.
———————————————
For example, if your [W] strike is
effective, follow it up by grabbin'
with [A]!
———————————————
For example... If you manage to
sidestep with [<][+][>], follow it up
with an open-palm strike with [W] or
a grab with [A]!
———————————————
For example... If you're grabbed,
try to break loose with [A]! Push
your foe away to escape your
predicament.
———————————————
For example, if you manage to grab
with [A], then continue to push your
opponent with [A]!
———————————————
Um... You just swing [W], right?
———————————————
Wow! A horizontal slice! Was that
it? Was it?


I think I've seen you do a vertical
slice before, too. You know, by
swinging [W] while [Z]-targeting.
———————————————
Wow! A vertical slice! Was that it?
Was it?


I think I've seen you do a
horizontal slice before, too. You
know, by just swinging [W].
———————————————
Yeah, you target with [Z] and then
just tilt [+] forward and swing [W].
———————————————
I thought that you just swung [W] to
do a slice?
———————————————
Hey, [Link]! Do it again!
Show how you flex your muscles
and stab! Y'know, target with [Z],
then tilt [+] forward and swing [W]!
———————————————
You just lightly shake the Nunchuk side
to side...
———————————————
But all you do is just lightly shake the
Nunchuk side to side...
———————————————
That thing you do with [A] while [Z]-targeting?
———————————————
Did I not say you use [A] while [Z]-targeting?
———————————————
If y'all press [A] to dash just as you
get near a fence, y'all can jump
over the middle of it.
———————————————
Feel free to look around using [<][+].
———————————————
Feel free to look around using [<][+].
———————————————
Interested in something? Take a
look using [<][+].
———————————————
So, are you shopping again today?
You can check out my wares with
[<][+].
———————————————
Oh... I know! Is there anything here
you can use?! I don't have much,
but please take a look around! [<][+]
———————————————
We're not able to restock anything,
but you can take a look at what
little we have left with [<][+].
———————————————
Even you ought to stock up so
you're prepared for a worst-case
scenario, right? [<][+]
———————————————
We don't have much in the way of
products...but feel free to look
around with [<][+].
———————————————
If there's something you're looking
for, m'dear, you can use [<][+] to
see if we have it.
———————————————
[Link], need something?
You should take a look around here
and see if there's anything you
want! [<][+]
———————————————
Yo, [Link]! Try talking to
me from there with [A] while
[Z]-targeting!
———————————————
Think you can teach my little tykes
to talk to someone from a distance
by pressing [A] while holding [Z]?
———————————————
These two will never let it go,
[Link]. Just show them.


First, use [W] to aim [R].
———————————————
It says in the slingshot manual that
you can tilt [<][+][>] to look around
while using the slingshot.
———————————————
You know, you can tilt [<][+][>] to
look around while you use the
slingshot. It said so in the
slingshot manual!
———————————————
I'm pretty sure that you go to the
["-"] screen to set the slingshot to [B].
Then you press [B] to use it!
———————————————
I'm pretty sure you use [W] to aim
with [R] and tilt [<][+][>] to look
around...
———————————————
Tilt [<][+][>] to look around and then
just aim [R] with [W]...
———————————————
You know these brats will never let
you get away, [Link].
You're going to have to stick it out.
Just point with [W] to aim [R]!
———————————————
You can tilt [<][+][>] to look around
when you're using the slingshot...
According to the manual...
———————————————
It said you can tilt [<][+][>] to look
around...
———————————————
You go to the ["-"] screen and set the
slingshot to [B]... Then you press [B]
to fire! It's not complicated.
———————————————
You point with [W] to aim [R] and tilt
[<][+][>] to look around!
———————————————
Set it to [B] on the ["-"] screen...
Use pumpkin seeds for pellets...
Beth has used this before...
———————————————
If you lock on with [Z], then you
don't have to aim with the cursor
at all!
———————————————
Look! See? Up there in that tree...
If you use [C] and then [o] or [W] to
move the cursor around, you can
get a better view.
———————————————
Look! See it? Up in that tree... You
can get a better view if you just
press [C] and then use [o] or [W] to
move the cursor and look around.
———————————————
[Link]... Get it right, lad!
I want you to plant your feet by
holdin' down [A] and then grabbin'
that critter...
———————————————
If you plant your feet by holdin'
down [A] and hang on to that goat,
you'll calm him down real quick.
———————————————
What's the matter? Just take a look
at my wares using [<][+]...
———————————————
Hey, don't just gawk at me! Check
out my wares using [<][+].
———————————————
We've got to get through Faron

Have you listened to everything
Renado had to say?

I'm worried about Ilia too...but I'm
more concerned about the Zoras
of Lake Hylia right now.
———————————————
Of course, I agree with Renado
completely. This man is ASTUTE!
———————————————
You go on now, [Link]!
See after the Zoras at the lake!
———————————————
Mercy, this boy is simple...
———————————————
Hurry! Go to the Zoras!
———————————————
I dropped a letter into the hot
spring and now I can't read it!
Gotta blow this thing dry...
———————————————
...There is armor here that my
husband made for the coming hero.
It holds the power of the Zoras.
———————————————
I am sure that having garb that
allows you to move freely in water
would aid you in your travels.
———————————————
I have waited for you.
———————————————
Come... This way...
———————————————
I am deeply grateful to you for
aiding my son in his time of need.
———————————————
You were right to bring him here.
Kakariko Village is a sacred place
for the Zora people. It is where we
take our eternal rest.
———————————————
My husband in life, King Zora, also
rests his spirit here.
———————————————
It is no coincidence my son found
his salvation in this place.
———————————————
...That which I have promised you
is within this grave.
———————————————
During his lifetime, my husband
created garments specifically for
the chosen hero, garments that
house the abilities of the Zora.
———————————————
Now, at last, I can join the king
in slumber.
———————————————
And yet... My son... He still knows
nothing of my death.
———————————————
If you see him again, please pass
on this message...
———————————————
Tell him he must not grieve his
mother's passing. Tell him she
wanted him to be brave and live on
as the king of our people.
———————————————
And... Tell him his mother...loves
him without end. Tell him...
———————————————
This way...
———————————————
Please tell my son when he
wakes...
———————————————
Hero... Take this armor and use it
to go to the bottom of Lake Hylia,
to the temple that is the pride of
my people.
———————————————
In the temple, there is a forbidden
power sealed by the spirits of
light...
———————————————
It was sealed there before it could
fall into the hands of the dark
ones...
———————————————
I don't wanna leave all these
people just to save ourselves!
———————————————
Come on, [Link]! Can't you
do something?
———————————————
Isn't there...some way to make up
with the Gorons?
———————————————
You'd think someone could go to
the mines and do something...
———————————————
Come on now, Colin, do you not
want to eat some stew?
———————————————
Wait, wait! Before you do, drink
some of this!
———————————————
Yeah, it's a special drink I made!
I blended water from the spirit's
spring with water from the hot
springs! It's yummy!
———————————————
Uh... OK...
———————————————
Here you go! One Beth Special!
———————————————
I mean, c'mon, water from the
spirit's spring AND the hot
springs?! It'll make you better
in no time!
———————————————
Colin, would you not rather have
some stew? You must be hungry,
are you not?
———————————————
Uh... OK...

How the heck am I supposed to

Hey! I've been waitin' on you!

Take a peek at this! I finished my

These little fellas are so advanced,
you can even use 'em in the water!
Oh, they'll come in handy,

Yep, well, I've finally got my entire

And ain't they a bunch of beauts?
———————————————
Tell you what: I'll stuff your bomb

———————————————
Tell you what: I'll stuff your bomb
bag there full of bombs for just

———————————————
Well, shoot, in that case, might you
be interested in a [ 8C]premium kit?
I limit those to one per person!
How 'bout that, now?
———————————————
What's this, now? Looks to me an 
awful lot like your bomb bag is full.
———————————————
Cripes! Seems like everyone's
tryin' to pull a fast one these days.
———————————————
Boy, I don't have a clue who this

gotta say, I ain't overly confident
he's gonna come save this village!

...Thing is, I can't get the materials
I need from the Gorons anymore...
Man, I ain't got a CLUE what to do!
———————————————
Hey now, bud!
———————————————
How 'bout this, now? Yep, I finally
managed to get my numbers
together and open up shop again.
———————————————
Well, sort of... I guess I've only got
one type of bomb, but hey, that's
one more than none, right? If only
my storehouse had survived...
———————————————
But hey, ain't as bad as all that...
I'll add more types as we go.
For now, have yourself a look-see
at what I've got so far! [+][>]
———————————————
Barnes's bombs boast the biggest
blasts, believe it! Better buy a
bunch before they're all bought!
Can't beat Barnes's bombs! [+][>]
———————————————
Well hey, we're open 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, so you just
drop on by anytime!
———————————————
These things are practically works
of art, now! You be sure to take a
good look at 'em! [+][>]
———————————————
Well, we've got [ 8C]10 bombs for 30
Rupees, [ 8C]20 for 60, or [ 8C]30 for 90.
Or just press [B] to walk away...
———————————————
[.]10 Bombs
[.]20 Bombs
[.]30 Bombs
———————————————
Listen now, good to hear you want
my bombs...but you ain't got the
Rupees to buy 'em, bud!
———————————————
Hey, listen, I can't fit everything
you want into your bag. You still
wanna buy 'em? I can't offer no
discounts for a partial order...
———————————————
[.]I'll buy 'em.
[.]Never mind.
———————————————
Whoa now! Why, that bag's full up!
Ain't you been usin' them bombs?
You know they ain't jewelry, right?
Bombs are meant to bomb stuff!
———————————————
All right, now! Then I'll just stuff
these fellas into your bomb bag!
———————————————
Whoa! Hey now! You insane, bud?!
That's dangerous! Don't go lightin'
fires in the middle of my shop!
———————————————
What's this, now? You ain't got a
bomb bag for carryin' bombs, huh?
———————————————
I've got a special offer goin' right
now: my bomb bag [ 8C]premium kit,
which comes with bag and bombs,
just 120 Rupees! How 'bout that?
———————————————
I've got a deal for you: a bomb bag
stuffed with water bombs! Yeah,
this [ 8C]premium kit is yours for only
220 Rupees! How 'bout that, now?
———————————————
I can sell you a [ 8C]premium kit that
includes a bomb bag stuffed with
bombs. Yours for only 250 Rupees!
How 'bout that, now?
———————————————
[.]I'll take it.
[.]Never mind.
———————————————
Pleasure doin' business, bud!
Here ya go!
———————————————
Whoa, whoa, hold up, now!
You ain't got enough Rupees, bud!
I can't go lower on that price, so
you'd best be on your way.
———————————————
What's this, now? That bomb bag
you got looks like it's jam-packed!
Want me to put in an order for a
new bomb bag for ya?
———————————————
Well, don't come cryin' to me if you
miss out on bombs that don't fit in
your bag. You sure you're OK with
what you've selected?
———————————————
[.]I'll buy it!
[.]Never mind.
———————————————
[quant.] 
———————————————
Mmm... Looks like your bomb bag
has some other sort of bomb in it...
———————————————
Oh, mercy! It appears you have
some more, sir! Allow me to take
another peek at your bomb bag...
———————————————
A very good day to you, sir!
Welcome to the incredibly fancy
bomb buyback counter!

Head to the counter next to this

You got any bombs you ain't gonna

———————————————
Well, what will it be, sir? Do you

What?! Oh. Oh, I understand...
You don't care for them...

———————————————
Oooh, sorry, bud, but that type of
bomb ain't ready yet. I'll letcha
know once I start sellin' 'em, OK?
You just hold tight, now.
———————————————
It's 6 Rupees for [ 8C]1, 30 for [ 8C]5, or 60

———————————————
Hey now, your bomb bag's full!
You can't buy any bombs until you
make some room in there!
———————————————
That's right! Now you'll get to taste
the true height of perfection with
my finely-crafted bombs!
———————————————
Oh... And you can combine bombs
and arrows to make bomb arrows
for when you need ranged
explosives!
———————————————
I'll send you a letter with the
details later so you can read about
it at your leisure.
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
Trying to go near the mines is very
dangerous.
———————————————
I will be very sad to be separated
from Colin and the others...but I
know they must go. Please return
them safely to their parents.
———————————————
Do not worry about Colin.
———————————————
Just come back safely.
———————————————
Are you going to see the Gorons,
[Link]?
———————————————
I am sorry you have to do this task
for us.
———————————————
I will be here with Colin, so please,
do not worry about him.
———————————————
Leave his care to me!
———————————————
I just hope you can do something
about the Gorons...
———————————————
I will stay here beside him!
———————————————
Are you going to continue your
journeys, [Link]?
———————————————
Good luck! And please, do not
worry about us!
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
The Zora child has opened his
eyes and is up and about!
———————————————
But...
———————————————
All he does is go to the graveyard
behind the sanctuary and pray...
All day, from morning until night,
he prays...
———————————————
That poor Zora boy... He must have
been through something awful...
———————————————
I hope he will start feeling better
soon...
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
The Zora boy said that you gave
him courage!
———————————————
I guess that boy... Is his name
Ralis? Yes, well, I guess Ralis is
the son of the Zora royal family.
———————————————
He said that he was the successor
to the Zora throne, so he had to go
back to his home...
———————————————
I am just glad that thanks to you,
he has healed, [Link].
———————————————
Ralis must be hard at work in his
own village...
———————————————
Now, if we could just find a way to
get Ilia her memory back, then
everything would be great...
———————————————
Ralis and Ilia and everyone else are
all better now! I am so happy!
———————————————
But...Ralis left to be with his
people, and everyone from Ordon
will go back to their homes soon...
———————————————
With everyone all gone, things will
be a lot quieter around here. And a
lot lonelier...

Blue Potion[ 8C]   100 Rupees
Drink this to replenish all hearts in
one gulp, Brother! It is expensive,
but its effectiveness is unbeatable!
———————————————
The blue potion is 100 Rupees.
Will you buy some, Brother?
———————————————
Blue potion costs 100 Rupees,
Brother! But since you cannot
afford it, you cannot have it!
———————————————
I cannot sell you blue potion if you
do not have an empty bottle to
carry it in, Brother!
———————————————
Thank you, Brother! Now let me fill
your empty bottle with blue potion!
———————————————
Red Potion[ 8C]   30 Rupees
This replenishes 8 hearts,
Brother! If you will be traveling,
you should take some with you.
———————————————
Red potion costs 30 Rupees.
Will you buy some, Brother?
———————————————
Red potion costs 30 Rupees.
But you cannot afford it, so you
cannot have it, Brother!
———————————————
I cannot sell you red potion if you
do not have an empty bottle to
store it in, Brother!
———————————————
Thank you, Brother! Now let me fill
your empty bottle with red potion!
———————————————
We'll wait here for you for as long
as it takes!
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
I can't believe Colin... I mean, that
was a really brave thing for him to
do, huh? Especially since he's
such a weakling!
———————————————
Um... He IS gonna be all right,
right?
———————————————
And Malo! He hasn't even come by
to say "Get well soon!" What's he
thinking?
———————————————
Ah... Oh, no...
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
Check me out: I'm up here keeping
watch for the whole town!
———————————————
Yeah! Any more monsters try to
attack, and I'm gonna be ready!
I'll shout my head off and warn
everybody!
———————————————
Aw, gee, but if I had a bow, then I
could just sit up here and shoot
all those nasty monsters...
———————————————
Oooh! Hey! I know, [Link]!
You can show me how to use one!
———————————————
C'mon, PLEASE?! Just show me
how you shoot a bow,
[Link]! OK?
———————————————
[.]OK
[.]No
———————————————
Oooh! YESSS!
———————————————
OK! Malo's down there in front of
the spring, so go down and find
him, then show me from there!
———————————————
What?! You gotta be kidding...
———————————————
C'mon! Just show me really quick!
I wanna see how to shoot that bow!
———————————————
[Link]! Show me how to
use a bow again!
———————————————
All's clear!
———————————————
HEY!
———————————————
UP HERE!
———————————————
Try to hit this pole!
———————————————
Whoa! That was soooooo CLOSE!
Just a teensy bit off!
———————————————
WHOOOAAA!
You hit it! You hit it!
———————————————
Thanks, [Link]!
———————————————
How'd you get to be so awesome,
[Link]! I mean, gee, you're
good at the sword AND the bow!
———————————————
Aw, I can't WAIT to grow up!
———————————————
I can't do much, but at least I TRY
really hard!
———————————————
Whoa! You hit it again! Wow!
You're amazing, [Link]!
———————————————
Whatcha doing, [Link]?
———————————————
Hitting it from that close isn't
anything to brag about!
———————————————
Oooh, I can't believe you missed
from THERE! Ha ha ha ha!
———————————————
WHOA!
———————————————
It... It's a MONSTER!
EVERYBODY RUN!!!
———————————————
That crazy little Malo... He went
into the shop, and now he's up to
something in there!
———————————————
He said he needed to "get started,"
but what's he need in a closed-up
shop, anyhow?
———————————————
He said he was gonna "get started,"
and he hasn't come out of that
closed-up shop since!
———————————————
[Link], could you talk some
sense into that kid?
———————————————
...Use your brain!
———————————————
Think. Is there a reason for us to
be open at a time like this? No.
And don't try to tell me the
customer's always right...
———————————————
We have CLOSED for the day.
Come back another time when
we are OPEN.
———————————————
We're not open yet. Certainly not
for impatient morning people.
———————————————
Hey...
———————————————
You can look at stuff, but don't you
DARE just take things...
———————————————
That's MY valuable merchandise.
You want it, you pay for it...
———————————————
I decided to take on this unmanned
shop...
———————————————
Buy something... It helps the whole
village when you do...[+][>]
———————————————
...Help him...
———————————————
You came...
———————————————
But...can you really use a bow?
———————————————
I've never seen you so much as
hold a bow back in Ordon...
———————————————
...Whatever.
———————————————
First off, shoot through that...
———————————————
Hmph... I guess that one was a bit
on the easy side...
———————————————
Fine. How about THAT?
———————————————
Oh... I guess you have a little bit of
skill when you concentrate.
———————————————
Looks like you've left some battles
behind you... Impressive.
———————————————
.........
———————————————
...Take this.
———————————————
Looks like you can use a bow...
———————————————
...So you tried it... What do you
think? Isn't it great?
———————————————
The fact that you don't have any
arrows isn't helping your "I'm-a-
master-archer" argument...
———————————————
Before you try, I guess I can give
you a couple of arrows...but just
this one time.
———————————————
What? Are you giving up?
———————————————
[.]I give up.
[.]I'm no quitter!
———————————————
Hey, here's a little friendly advice
from me to you: if this were a
battlefield, you'd be dead. 
———————————————
Do you have confidence issues?
———————————————
If you've got doubts about your
bow skills, you should test out the
Hawkeye in my shop.
———————————————
Boy, Talo thinks the world of you,
and now you're going to shatter
his expectations. Poor kid...
———————————————
You want [ 8C]arrows? Well, including
delivery expenses, it comes to
15 Rupees for [ 8C]10 arrows...
———————————————
[.]I'll take 'em.
[.]No thanks.
———————————————
They're yours...
———————————————
Are you all done, then?
———————————————
Looks like you're out of both
arrows and money. Sorry, but
we're done here...
———————————————
...If you're tired of wasting arrows,
you should try the Hawkeye at my
shop. Trust me, you need it.
———————————————
So, you think I enjoy watching you
loiter around NOT shooting arrows?
If this were a battlefield, you'd be
dead...
———————————————
You mind sharing with me how
much time you intend to waste on
silly games like this?
———————————————
I mean, really, you think monsters
play fun little games? Keep this up
and you won't survive a second on
the battlefield.
———————————————
If you're tired of wasting time, you
should check out the Hawkeye in
my shop. Trust me, you need it.
———————————————
...You're all out of arrows? Do I
look surprised to you? You wasted
shots like it was your day job!
———————————————
Unless your idea of fun is throwing
arrows directly into the garbage,
you should try out the Hawkeye in
my shop. Trust me, you need it.
———————————————
All right... If you need [ 8C]arrows, I'll
sell you some. They're 15 Rupees
for [ 8C]10 arrows. Of course, that
includes shipping and handling...
———————————————
What did you just hit?
———————————————
Uh, didn't I tell you to shoot it?
Sheesh... Dig the dirt out of those ears...
———————————————
Well, all right... Shoot THAT next...
———————————————
Back again?
———————————————
Hmph... Well, fine, all right...
Use these...
———————————————
...Hey! By the way...
———————————————
What's the deal with you not
bringing any arrows when you know
darn well you'll need them? Huh?
———————————————
All right, THIS time, try to hit
THAT...
———————————————
All right. THIS time, try to hit
THAT...
———————————————
All right. I guess I'll have you try to
shoot the final target...
———————————————
...Call me crazy, but I don't think a
bow with no arrows is ever going to
hit a target... What, were you
planning on throwing it?
———————————————
...Oh, I get it. Used THAT again,
did you? What do you think about
maybe finally putting your ACTUAL
skills to the test?
———————————————
...Have 10 Rupees.

———————————————
I'll give you something better next
time if you can use your own skill
to hit it. You know, instead of
relying on a tool like a wimp...
———————————————
I'll take really good care of Colin,
I promise!
———————————————
You be careful, [Link]...
———————————————
Just leave Colin to me!
———————————————
You'll see, [Link]! Promise!
I'll make him all better while you're
up on the Gorons' mountain!
———————————————
What... What should we do?
Colin... Oh, Colin...
———————————————
[Link]! Colin's been...
Colin's... No!
———————————————
I'll take care of this boy.
———————————————
The shaman's been really worried
about this boy, but I think he's
also worried about the Zora tribe.
———————————————
[Link], you've gotta help!
Please help the Zoras!
———————————————
[Link], did you know?
———————————————
That Zora boy is actually the prince
of the Zora tribe! Yeah!
———————————————
Aw, if I had gotten to know him
better, maybe I could've gone and
met the royal family and been a
princess or something...
———————————————
Awwww, RATS! I let a REALLY big
fish get away!
———————————————
Hey... Y'know what my dad says?
———————————————
He says, "The loneliest fish grow
largest." You think that means
Ralis is meant to be alone for now?
———————————————
I thought that Zora boy had gotten
better, but he's been really
depressed lately...
———————————————
He doesn't try to make friends with
anyone, and every day he just gets
up and goes straight to the
graveyard! It's really weird!
———————————————
Can't you talk to him,
[Link]?
———————————————
Hurry up and rescue Ilia,
[Link]!
———————————————
You have to promise!
———————————————
This boy is really sick, and now it
sounds like the rest of the Zoras
are in trouble, too, right?
———————————————
I'm gonna try to help him get better
quickly so we can take him home!
———————————————
Oh, [Link]!
———————————————
I heard from the shaman that Ilia
might be able to get her memory
back!
———————————————
Yeah! AND the Zora boy opened
his eyes!
———————————————
Yeah, I thought those were both
pretty good things, but Ilia and the
Zora boy seem pretty sad still.
———————————————
Ilia and the Zora boy both went
out...
———————————————
Ilia goes to the sanctuary every
day. I think she prays there...
———————————————
The Zora boy prays, too. Every day
he goes to the graveyard and
stays for hours...
———————————————
How can I make them be happy
again?
———————————————
Oh, [Link]!
———————————————
That Zora boy, Ralis, went back to
his village the other day!
———————————————
Did you say something to Ralis,
[Link]?
———————————————
That was really nice!
———————————————
Ilia goes to the sanctuary every
day to pray...
———————————————
I really hope she gets her memory
back soon... Maybe then she'll feel
better.
———————————————
It's so great! Ilia got her memory
back! I can't believe it!
———————————————
[Link], you can even get
people's memories back for them?!
You can do ANYTHING!
———————————————
If only that Zora boy would get
better...
———————————————
He prays in the graveyard every
day. He seems so sad...
———————————————
Ilia and Ralis both got better...
Everything's so great here!
———————————————
But...you aren't trying to help just
the people HERE, are you. You're
trying to help everyone in the
world, right, [Link]?
———————————————
No matter how long it takes for you
to come back, we'll be waiting for
you, [Link]!
———————————————
When I grow up, if I have a son,
I'm gonna make sure he turns into
a guy who can do anything...just
like you, [Link]!
———————————————
Brother! Hey, Brother!
———————————————
Buy something from me, Brother!
Buy something![+][>]
———————————————
You do not have a bow, Brother.
You cannot use arrows even if you
do buy them!
———————————————
You cannot fit any more in your
quiver, Brother! You should buy
arrows from me when you are
running low!
———————————————
[ 8C]10 arrows will cost you 10 Rupees.
Will you buy them, Brother?
———————————————
[ 8C]10 arrows cost 10 Rupees, Brother.
But if you do not have enough
Rupees, I cannot sell them to you!
———————————————
[.]Done!
[.]No thanks.
———————————————
Thank you so much, Brother!
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil costs[ 8C] 20 Rupees,
Brother. Will you buy some?
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil costs 20 Rupees,
Brother. But since you do not have
enough Rupees, I cannot sell you
any! Sorry!
———————————————
If you do not have an empty bottle
or a lantern that is low on oil, I
cannot pour you any oil, Brother!
———————————————
Looks like you still have some oil
left. Should I fill you up anyway,
Brother? The price is still
20 Rupees...
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk runs[ 8C] 20 Rupees for 2 helpings,
Brother. Will you buy some?
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk runs[ 8C] 20 Rupees for 2 helpings,
Brother. But since you do not have
enough Rupees, I cannot sell you
any! Sorry!
———————————————
I cannot sell you any [ 8C]milk if you
do not have an empty bottle to
hold it in, Brother!
———————————————
Thank you so much, Brother!
I will just pour some milk into your
empty bottle!
———————————————
Thank you so much, Brother!
I will just pour some oil into your
empty bottle!
———————————————
Thank you so much, Brother!
I will just pour some oil into your
lantern!
———————————————
I will be here tomorrow, too, in
case you are interested!
———————————————
This is all I brought, Brother![+][>]
———————————————
Hey there, Brother! Buy something!
Buy something!
———————————————
I brought a bunch of stuff with me
from the mountains, Brother! It is
different from what they sell in this
town... Take a look![+][>]
———————————————
I am here every night, so come by
next time, Brother!
———————————————
Want to go up top, Brother?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
Climb up, Brother!
———————————————
Well, all right, Brother, but if you
ever DO want to go up top, I will
launch you up there!
———————————————
Hoooo... A good, warm soak is just
what my muscles need before
evening falls, Brother!
———————————————
I sell stuff across from the bomb
shop at night. I hope to see you
there, Brother!
———————————————
We are very grateful to you for
saving our chief and our precious
mines, Brother.
———————————————
We caused a lot of trouble for the
people of this town. It is our turn
to repay them!
———————————————
Hey, Brother! Climb up on my back
and I will launch you up to the
hotel's hot spring!
———————————————
[.]I'll climb on!
[.]No thanks.
———————————————
I heard this town was also attacked
by beasts, and that it had met with
a terrible fate...
———————————————
It is shameful that we were so
concerned with ourselves that we
did not even help them.
———————————————
I am helping the little human up
above keep watch to help relations
between Kakariko Village and our
people on Death Mountain!
———————————————
You want to check out the view
from up top?  It is pretty amazing
scenery, Brother! Climb up on my
back and take a look!
———————————————
If you want to get a bird's-eye view
of town, you should climb on my
back, Brother. I will launch you up!
———————————————
You saved our chief, Brother, and
we are thankful. Now we are able
to come back down to the village
again!
———————————————
Since this town was also attacked,
I figured the townsfolk would need
supplies. So, my son and I brought
some things down, Brother!
———————————————
At night, my son opens up a shop
down below. You should stop by
sometime, Brother!
———————————————
Now that we are able to go back
into our mines, I was finally able to
bring Barnes a new delivery of
bomb ingredients, Brother!
———————————————
It looks like he has already started
selling them again. You should
try out Barnes-brand bombs
sometime, Brother!
———————————————
Say, Brother... If you ever want to
get onto the roof of the store, I can
launch you up there. What do you
say to that?
———————————————
If you ever want to get on top of
this shop, just climb up on my
back, Brother!
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk (2 Servings)   20 Rupees
One serving has 3 hearts worth
of nutrients, Brother! A full bottle
holds two servings!
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern Oil   20 Rupees
The mountain trail is pitch-black at
night! Make sure you have enough
oil, Brother!
———————————————
[ 8C]10 Arrows   10 Rupees
Handmade by me, Brother!
Buy lots of them!
———————————————
I will watch over the children as if
they were my own. You need not
worry about them.
———————————————
May the blessings of the great
goddesses who created Hyrule be
with you.

———————————————
As things are now, it is likely safest
for us to remain here...
———————————————
How strange... The candles should
have all been put out...
———————————————
What sorcery is this?! The entrance
to the cellar opening on its own...
———————————————
Could those beasts have 
engineered even this?
———————————————
I do not know what is in the
Goron mines, but surely they will
soon come to understand it, and
right what is wrong.
———————————————
Do not concern yourself with me,
my son. You must flee this place
as quickly as you can.
———————————————
Ah, how fortunate you are in one
piece! I saw you heading up the
mountain trail, so I was worried.
———————————————
Are you trying to reach the Gorons
of Death Mountain? It is far too
dangerous, [Link]!
———————————————
They recognize only strength!
A normal person could never
persuade them...
———————————————
But...I do know one person who
was able to best them and earn
their trust...
———————————————
His name is Bo. You may know him
as the mayor of your hometown,
Ordon.
———————————————
Please, go to him. And while you
are there, please let him know that
the children are safe.
———————————————
Of course, getting them back would
be best...but we could not keep
them safe from the monsters on the
road without a horse and cart...
———————————————
Please... Return to Ordon and
inform the parents that their
children are free from harm.
Give them my word.
———————————————
And...if you truly will go to Death
Mountain on our behalf, then you
should definitely consult with Bo.
———————————————
Do not worry. He merely sleeps.
———————————————
So long as he continues to rest,
he shall eventually open his eyes.
———————————————
And these two are doing a fine job
of nursing him back to health...
———————————————
You two! Be calm in here!
———————————————
I shall watch over the children of
Ordon, I swear it. They shall never
encounter danger while I breathe.
———————————————
I will take full responsibility for
them until they are returned safely
to their village. You need not worry
for them.
———————————————
[Link]! Hurry!
———————————————
They fled north toward the field!
———————————————
Much has happened here, but at
last I feel joy beginning to return
to this village, thanks to you...
———————————————
I am grateful for what you have
done.
———————————————
Even Talo, who was so saddened
by the incident with Colin, has at
last recovered his good spirits.
———————————————
The lookout platform is high
above the bomb shop. I am sure
that if you were to go there to
speak to Talo, he would be happy.
———————————————
Something about that Zora boy is
giving me a feeling of...unease.
———————————————
I worry that something may have
happened to the Zoras of Lake
Hylia...
———————————————
...But I must first find a way to
recover Ilia's memory. She suffers,
and I must help.
———————————————
If I discover anything, I will let
you know immediately, so please
allow me a little time...
———————————————
I must find a way to recover Ilia's
memory! I must!
———————————————
...But the fate of the Zoras still
gives me pause. I hope nothing
is wrong on the lake bed.
———————————————
Ah! I have been waiting for you,
[Link].
———————————————
Fortune has smiled upon us!
If things go well, we should be able
to help Ilia recover her memory!
———————————————
The Goron elder believes that to
help her regain her lost memories,
we must piece together the
fragments of her past...
———————————————
Which means...
———————————————
If we work our way backward from
the very place where she lost her
memory, we may find something
that will restore it.
———————————————
Now we must retrace Ilia's path...
I am certain it was Telma who cared
for her before she arrived in this
village, was it not?
———————————————
It would be best to speak with her
first. Please take this to Telma!
———————————————
...It shames me to say it, but to be
honest, I cannot abide Telma's
company...
———————————————
We have a fighting chance,
[Link]!
———————————————
Now get going! You must deliver
my letter to Telma immediately!
I just cannot do it myself...
———————————————
The race to recover Ilia's memory
is on, [Link]!
———————————————
Did Telma say anything?
———————————————
If we can retrace Ilia's actions, we
should be able to find a clue...
———————————————
What is that? Could it be...
———————————————
Perhaps if you show that to Ilia,
she will remember something.
———————————————
If Ilia's recollection is correct,
then we need to find that person
in the hidden village...
———————————————
Perhaps that person holds the key
to unlocking her memory...
———————————————
But it is a long shot.
———————————————
It is a blessing to see Ilia returned
to good health.
———————————————
The return of her memory is the
fruit of your efforts.
———————————————
As for me... Nothing could bring me
greater joy than to aid the daughter
of an old friend. I look upon her
and see her father's smile.
———————————————
That acquaintance of Telma's is in
the cellar right now.
———————————————
He is very interested in that
ancient statue down below the
sanctuary...
———————————————
That acquaintance of Telma's is
visiting right now.
———————————————
He is very interested in that
ancient statue down below the
sanctuary...
———————————————
It is a blessing to see Ilia returned
to good health.
———————————————
The return of her memory is the
fruit of your efforts.
———————————————
As for me... Nothing could bring me
greater joy than to aid the daughter
of an old friend. I look upon her
and see her father's smile.
———————————————
Actually, I do not know anything
about the statue down below the
sanctuary.
———————————————
Actually, I do not know anything
about the statue down below the
sanctuary.
———————————————
You see, it was already there when
I became the shaman here...
———————————————
If you are interested, you should
descend and go see it yourself,
[Link].
———————————————
That young boy wanted dearly to
help, so he keeps watch from the
observation platform now...
———————————————
Greetings, [Link].
———————————————
I felt Ilia could use a change of
scenery to improve her health, so
we came here.
———————————————
Who knows? If she gets out and
sees daily life, perhaps something
will jog her memory...
———————————————
[Link], perhaps you could
keep her in your thoughts?
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
If anything happens, I will let you
know, but until then... Please keep
her in your thoughts.
———————————————
Do you know Telma's friend, Shad?
———————————————
Well, it seems he is researching the
heavens, and he has come here to
see the statue in the basement of
the sanctuary.
———————————————
And, as I have learned, when Ilia
was saved, she overheard someone
talking about the rod of the
heavens, or something like that...
———————————————
Shad is still down there in the
basement, investigating that statue.
———————————————
I think it is best for you to return
to Ordon and let everyone know
that the children are safe.
———————————————
And as for the Gorons...I am sure
Bo will be able to tell you how
best to win their trust!
———————————————
Hey, [Link].
———————————————
Buy something. [+][>]
———————————————
What do you plan on doing with
arrows when you don't even have a
bow? Sounds suspicious to me.
I'm not selling you squat.
———————————————
You can't fit any more in your
quiver. You really ought to use
your brain while shopping...
———————————————
[ 8C]10 arrows will run you 10 Rupees.
Want 'em or not?
———————————————
[ 8C]10 arrows would run you 10
Rupees...if you had that many.
Which you don't. So you get
nothing.
———————————————
[.]I'll buy.
[.]No thanks.
———————————————
I see. I SUPPOSE I can part with
it...
———————————————
A [ 8C]wooden shield will cost you 50
Rupees. Want one or not?
———————————————
A [ 8C]wooden shield will cost you 50
Rupees, but you can't afford it.
Don't expect a discount just
because we're from the same town.
———————————————
You can't go walking around
carrying a bunch of the same
shields... Use your brain.
———————————————
You already have a similar shield,
don't you? Yes. Yes, you do.
Sorry, there'll be no shameless
extravagance on my watch.
———————————————
A [ 8C]Hylian shield will cost you 200
Rupees. Want one or not?
———————————————
A [ 8C]Hylian shield will run you 200
Rupees...but if you have that much,
I'll eat my hat. And I don't even
HAVE a hat.
———————————————
Time is money. If you're done
shopping, then quit wasting both...
———————————————
Buy something.[+][>]
———————————————
Do you need something? [+][>]
———————————————
Well, you bought my last [ 8C]Hylian
shield...so you'd better take good
care of it.
———————————————
Somebody just rubbed their grubby
little hands all over my [ 8C]Hylian
shield, so I have to polish it all
over again... Sheesh...
———————————————
The [ 8C]Hawkeye is[ 8C] 100 Rupees. You 
want it or not?
———————————————
The [ 8C]Hawkeye costs 100 Rupees...
but there are people with enough
Rupees, and then there's you.
The guy with not enough.
———————————————
You bought my last [ 8C]Hawkeye...
———————————————
If you want some red potion, you'd
better bring an empty bottle...
———————————————
Red potion will cost you 30
Rupees, but I won't be donating
it to the poor, sorry.
———————————————
Red potion will cost you 30
Rupees. Want some or not?
———————————————
All right. Go ahead and dip your
empty bottle in...
———————————————
Maybe I can't become a hero...but
I figure I can help people out
with heroic business deals.
———————————————
You'd better work hard, too...
———————————————
Time is money, so quit wasting
both...
———————————————
I heard there's a lot of price
gouging going on in the shops
of Hyrule Castle Town. People are
pretty upset, I hear.
———————————————
I loathe people who take advantage
of the poor, unwashed masses.
Give to my Castle Town shop fund
so I can finance a shop there!
———————————————
This is all going for the good of the
people in Castle Town. Honest.
Come on, help me finance a new
shop there...
———————————————
If you'd like it, I can polish it right
away. So come back and see me...
———————————————
There are no more [ 8C]Hylian shields...
so you should be pretty careful
with yours...
———————————————
[ 8C]Bombling (1):   6 Rupees
These cute little bugs walk around
and blow up all on their own!

This potion replenishes your
life energy. Keep it in an empty
bottle.

[ 8C]Hawkeye: 100 Rupees
This eyewear allows you to see
distant objects as if with the eyes

These bombs even work

[ 8C]Hylian Shield: 200 Rupees
        LIMITED SUPPLY!
Don't let them sell out before you
buy one!
———————————————
Ohh... You're here! You're here!
———————————————
Monsters attacking, buildings
destroyed... The people here have
it rough...[sfx] Eee hee!
———————————————
Huh?! What did you do?!
———————————————
Sorry, but as romantic as this is,
I'm not going to stay here with
you. I'm getting out!
———————————————
HEY! If you don't hurry up and
get out... Ohh, I can't even say it!
———————————————
If you're done with your errand,
then let's get out of here.
———————————————
If you want to go outside, we'll
have to climb up from here.
———————————————
But don't you think you should
take care of your business first?
———————————————
...I wonder if I put him off?
———————————————
Hmm... I don't suppose there's any
nicer way to hunt these things,
huh?
———————————————
Well, you had to sacrifice
someone's house to find Tears of
Light...but that's how the cookie
crumbles, right?
———————————————
Huh? Aren't you going to grab it?
———————————————
Riding that horse would be much
faster than hoofing it, so let's try
and grab it!
———————————————
A wild horse like that, you probably
mount with [A] and then hang on for
dear life with [<][+][>] until you can
get it to run straight. Simple!
———————————————
You REALLY think we should just
forget about the Zora queen?
Didn't she say she'd give us
something?
———————————————
You've got to take what you can
get... [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Hmm... You're not too shabby a
wrangler after all!
———————————————
Won't this make getting back to
your town a lot easier?
———————————————
Now go finish your errand so we
can get back! Get a move on!
———————————————
I must be cursed. Perpetually
returning to that boring, hayseed
town in the sticks! [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
These kids knew you'd come save
them! What a hero!
———————————————
How sad, to be right in front of
someone and not be noticed at
all... [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
You are chosen by the gods, and
only that keeps you from turning
into a spirit, or worse, into a dark
monster, when you enter twilight.
———————————————
And no one knows what you have
done... You may be doomed to toil
in obscurity forever...
———————————————
You're the type to worry about
everything, I can tell...but don't
fret over Princess Zelda! She chose
this state of affairs, after all...
———————————————
Anyway, what's with having to
light candles to get to the
basement?! Not very subtle, is it...
———————————————
So, what are you going to do now?
My lonely little hero... [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Well, it's a good thing you found all
of your friends and picked up that
nifty Zora armor...
———————————————
But aren't you forgetting something
kind of important?
———————————————
That last Fused Shadow...
———————————————
Remember what Faron the light
spirit said...
———————————————
He said you would need the
Fused Shadows to defeat the dark
overlord Zant and save the world...
———————————————
So even if you go back now with all
of the people you saved... The
whole tragedy would just repeat
itself...
———————————————
So let's go get it!
———————————————
We need to go to the temple on
the lake bed of Lake Hylia.
———————————————
The writing in the book was a spell
that imbued the staff with magic!
———————————————
Now you can do to the other
statues what you did before...
———————————————
So... He did say he would mark
your map wherever there was a
statue, didn't he?
———————————————
Then we should go check out those
spots, right, [Link]?
———————————————
Mm... I can't remember anything...
———————————————
...[Link].
———————————————
...[Link].
———————————————
Do you really think I'll recover my
memory?
———————————————
I regret that a complete stranger
like yourself got caught up in all of
this because of me. I'm so sorry.
———————————————
Um...[Link]?
———————————————
Did you hear what the shaman
said?
———————————————
What...is this?!
———————————————
I... I remember something... I was
confined somewhere... Yes, and I
was saved by whoever was confined
with me...
———————————————
And when that person set me free,
they gave me this statue...
———————————————
Yes, yes, I remember that much!
But that means...that person is still
in trouble!
———————————————
Oh, what is WRONG with me?!
I can't remember where that place
was!
———————————————
I REMEMBER!
———————————————
That belonged to the tribe that
protected the Hylian royal family
long ago.
———————————————
They worked in secret, so they
lived in a lonely, forgotten place.
But I heard that tribe dwindled in
the prolonged wars...
———————————————
If you want to find that hidden
village, look for a path leading to
the Lanayru province on the far
side of the Bridge of Eldin.
———————————————
But...a rockslide blocked the way
to the village long ago, so you
can't get there anymore.
———————————————
What? Oh, I do not mean to worry
you, little human. Problems like
these are not problems to Gorons.
———————————————
Our patriarch, Darbus, will be
waiting for you up ahead. Look at
your map to see where.
———————————————
I would try to find the path beyond
the Bridge of Eldin that leads to
Lanayru Province.
———————————————
Please... Don't worry about my
memory... Just do something to
help the one who set me free.
———————————————
Please, [Link]!
———————————————
Thanks to you, this child is saved.
———————————————
I want to thank you for being so
kind to someone like me...
Someone you don't even know.
———————————————
Through Renado's kindness I, too,
have been allowed to stay a little
longer under his care in this
village.
———————————————
The children here are all so kind.
Such a lovely little village...
———————————————
I thought I had seen that before
somewhere...
———————————————
I will be all right, [Link].
———————————————
I will be waiting here with the
children until you return!
———————————————
So...don't worry about us, OK?
———————————————
[Link], do you know Shad?
———————————————
The man downstairs right now...
I believe he is a friend of Telma's
from Castle Town, but I am not
sure.
———————————————
[Link]... Do you remember
what I was saying about the rod of
the heavens?
———————————————
Well, actually... It was about the
messenger to the heavens who held
the rod...
———————————————
The nice woman who saved me told
me about it...
———————————————
Apparently, in this woman's village,
they've guarded something for the
heavenly messenger for
generations, so they await him.
———————————————
But they can't give this item away
until the messenger arrives with
the rod...
———————————————
That's why the lady couldn't leave
her village, you see...
———————————————
Say, [Link]... Do you have
any idea who this messenger to the
heavens might be? Or even what
the rod is?
———————————————
I'd sure like to help that lady, and
if we can introduce her to whatever
messenger to the heavens has the
rod...
———————————————
Anyway, [Link]... Don't you
worry about me.
———————————————
I remember being saved from a
dangerous situation by someone...
Someone who told me all about
the rod of the heavens.
———————————————
But now I can't remember the who,
why, where, or what it all means...
———————————————
Oh, [Link]...
———————————————
You have gone through so much
trouble for me... I'm so sorry...
———————————————
Colin and the others have told me
so much about you, [Link].
———————————————
They tell me that you are brave and
kind, and that you herd very well...
That means you must be a good
rider, huh?
———————————————
Oh, and the name of your horse
is...[Epona], right?
———————————————
[Epona]!
———————————————
What a lovely name!
———————————————
I'm very good at sensing a horse's
feelings, and I can tell that
[Epona] trusts you!
———————————————
You would never ask her to do too
much, right?
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
Is that Shad fellow down there
a friend of yours, [Link]?
———————————————
I need to give him my thanks!
———————————————
[Link], isn't Shad waiting
for you down below?
———————————————
I wonder if everyone in Ordon is
OK? I must have made them worry
so...
———————————————
I'll have some apologizing to do
when I get back there!
———————————————
I have marked your map. You must
go to the path beyond the long
stone bridge that leads to Lanayru
Province. Find the hidden village!
———————————————
You cannot forget that even now,
some innocent is confined there!
———————————————
Whether we get that girl's memory
back, young warrior, will be up to
you.
———————————————
Even our chief, Darbus, has lost
the memory of his dark time...
We have not told him that you were
the one who saved him.
———————————————
He is a proud Goron, and he can
be...touchy. If he knew he had
been saved by a human...
———————————————
On the other hand, he does have a
strong sense of moral duty, so if
anything happens, you can count
on him to help.
———————————————
Darbus happened to hear that an
acquaintance of one of our
brothers had lost her memory and
was in some trouble.
———————————————
Me? I came down here because I
have a little something to discuss
with the shaman.
———————————————
Who are you, little human? The
young lady's acquaintance?
———————————————
Little human, it is time for you to
show your manliness...for the
girl's sake!
———————————————
If there is anything I can do to
help, just say so! It is in times like
these that we must come to one
another's aid!
———————————————
Not that you could ever do much to
help ME, my tiny friend! Gah ha ha!
———————————————
Welllllcome...to Malo Mart!
———————————————
I have heard from a reliable source
that shops in Hyrule Castle Town
are gouging prices, crushing folks
under the thumb of commerce!
———————————————
Well, fear not, Brudda, for Malo
Mart has proposed a townspeople-
relief plan as an answer to the
lamentations of the common man!
———————————————
Phase One: Repair the broken
bridge leading from east Castle
Town to the field in order to
improve traffic!
———————————————
Phase Two: Buy that Castle Town
shop and sell products to the town
at reduced prices! You have heard
me right, Brudda!
———————————————
There is a problem, however...
The finances for the execution of
this glorious plan are...lacking!
———————————————
Please, Brudda! Offer some
financial support to aid in the
purchase of the Castle Town shop!
For the benefit of the people!
———————————————
Welllllllcome!
———————————————
We are [val] short of our
financial objective... That is, the
opening of a shop in Castle Town!
———————————————
Please help us bring relief to the
people of Castle Town who are
suffering under the weight of an
inflated cost of living, Brudda!
———————————————
We look forward to your future
contributions, Brudda!
———————————————
Only [val] left to go! Thank
you for your cooperation, Brudda!
———————————————
Thank you for your cooperation,
Brudda!
———————————————
Please come again when you have
some spare Rupees, Brudda.
———————————————
Today marks the day that another
legendary establishment is born!
You should travel to Castle Town
later...
———————————————
Glorious day! We achieved our
goal, Brudda!
———————————————
We are [val] short of
funding for the bridge repairs...
We need that bridge for a steady
flow of goods to Castle Town...
———————————————
We MUST bring the cost of goods
down in Castle Town, Brudda!
Could you please help support this
worthy cause?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
Wellllllllcome to the Malo
Mart Flagship Store, Brudda!
———————————————
We are currently holding a GRAND
OPENING SALE at our brand-new
store in Hyrule Castle Town!
COME ONE! COME ALL!
———————————————
You will buy it now, if you are
smart, at MAAAAA-LOOOO MART!
———————————————
Thank You for Your Donations
     Malo Mart Management



———————————————
We have only [val] left to
raise before we reach our goal
for the bridge-repair fund! Thank
you for your support, Brudda!
———————————————
Glorious day! We have collected
enough funds to finance repairs to
the bridge connecting east Castle
Town to Hyrule Field, Brudda!
———————————————
Those corrupt, price-gouging
shops in Castle Town are officially
on notice! Soon they will rue!
———————————————
We hope you will continue your
financial support of our efforts to
sell products in the town at
discounted prices, Brudda!
———————————————
We now have only [val] left
before we reach our goal for
financing a store in Castle Town,
Brudda!
———————————————
We have only [val] left!
Thank you for your cooperation,
Brudda!
———————————————
Together, we can do anything!
———————————————
You will buy it now, if you are
smart, at MAAAAA-LOOOO MART!
———————————————
Thanks to all, the bridge is built,
the trade route is secure, and we
saved money for the economic
development of Castle Town!
———————————————
But in order to reach our Castle
Town development goal, we still
need [val]!
———————————————
Oh my... Color me surprised...
If it isn't [Link]!
———————————————
What a coincidence, meeting you
in a place like this. How very odd...
———————————————
Say, old boy, do you remember
what I told you before about the
legend of the sky beings known
as the Oocca?
———————————————
Yes, well, there's something about
it that's been bothering me, so I
came here to snoop about...
———————————————
To think that you would appear
here with such perfect timing!
You really are a rather
extraordinary fellow, aren't you?
———————————————
Oh, hello there! I came here today
to look into the Hyrulian legend of
the sky beings called the Oocca,
but...
———————————————
I say, old boy... Aren't you
[Link]?
———————————————
I'm a bit of a regular in Telma's
bar, so I've heard of you...and of
your exploits in battle.
———————————————
Terribly sorry about the other day,
old boy. I only made fun of you
because I hadn't a notion of who
you were...
———————————————
Oh... Where are my manners?
I'm Shad. I'm looking into the
Hyrulian legend of the sky
beings known as the Oocca...
———————————————
To think that you would appear
here with such perfect timing!
You really are a rather
extraordinary fellow, aren't you?
———————————————
I've found it at long last...
Observe this statue! It's the same
as the one in the manuscripts my
dear father left me.
———————————————
...Ahh!
———————————————
Perhaps...I am in your way?
———————————————
Well, forgive me for not realizing!
I should just disappear at times
like this, really.
———————————————
So... Let me know the results
another time, [Link].
———————————————
...Ah yes! Let me give you one last
piece of advice...
———————————————
That seems to be broken, so you'd
do well to show it to a cannon
expert first, I should say!
———————————————
Farewell!
———————————————
Blast it! This thing has confounded
me thoroughly...
———————————————
[Link]?!
———————————————
How in blazes did you move that
statue?! And...what's this...
———————————————
Amazing! Spectacular! This must be
the Sky Cannon I read about in my
father's notes!
———————————————
I knew that my intuition was onto
something when it led me here!
———————————————
...But how can one use this to get
to the City in the Sky?
———————————————
Stunning... I feel almost...nervous!
———————————————
Just think, if we could get this to
work, we could actually reach the
City in the Sky...
———————————————
Hmm... Pondering it here surely
won't get us far...
———————————————
I'm reluctant to return after coming
this far, but perhaps we should go
back and reevaluate things. Don't
you think, old boy?
———————————————
In any case, thanks to you, I'm one
giant leap closer to my dreams!
Many thanks, [Link]!
———————————————
Power has returned to the
Dominion Rod! Set it to and
swing it with [Y] or [X] to breathe
life into statues.
When imbued with life, the
statues move in the same way as
their master.
———————————————
There are many similar statues
around Hyrule, but this one seems
to be different.
———————————————
Here, look at the belly... There's
something written there, you see?
———————————————
This, too, was in my father's
notes... It is called Sky Writing,
I believe.
———————————————
"Awaken us with the word that
breaks the seal." ...Yes, indeed,
that is what it says.
———————————————
Statues, the word that breaks the
seal, and the rod of the heavens...
It just gets odder and odder...
———————————————
Now Ilia's memory is the last clue
we have to solving this strange
puzzle about the heavens...
———————————————
[Link], what shall we do?
———————————————
If only we knew the words that
break the seal, we could solve the
mystery of this statue and perhaps
find a path to the city in the sky...
———————————————
Ahhh... If only Ilia's memory would
return...
———————————————
What's this? [sfx]Ah! It's Sky Writing!
Where in blazes did you get this?
———————————————
You don't suppose this could be
the word that breaks the seal...
———————————————
R-Right! Let's try it out!
———————————————
...No reaction.
———————————————
So it is not this statue... Urgh...
———————————————
...[Link], thanks ever so.
You have brought me one step
closer to solving this puzzle.
I shall give the book back to you.
———————————————
Now! I shall try out this word on
other statues!
———————————————
I have made the rounds of these
statues so many times that I have
memorized their locations.

I will place marks on your map so
you can find them, in case you wish
to track me down.
———————————————
Remember, every one of those
marks is near an owl statue!


Now, if you'll excuse me!
———————————————
Ah, [Link]. Did you read
my letter?
———————————————
As it turned out, that word I
learned from you didn't do
anything with the statues I found...
———————————————
After all that, I wonder how that
word was supposed to be used...
———————————————
Since it was written in Sky Writing,
I was sure it had some kind of
meaning...
———————————————
Is this that book from last time?
———————————————
...Hm? [sfx]Are there more letters in
the word than the last time I looked
at this?
———————————————
How did you investigate the...
[Link], this is amazing!
Amazing!
———————————————
Now THIS must be the word we
need! Let's try it immediately!
———————————————
Ah!
———————————————
It has taken on the same shape as
the other statues...
———————————————
What can this mean?
———————————————
And I thought we had solved the
last of the riddles... Blast!
How confounding!
———————————————
...I must apologize, [Link].
I need to cool off a tad before
I mull the problem further...
———————————————
Wait a moment... Isn't that Ilia a
friend of yours?
———————————————
It's simply tragic how she lost her
memory.
———————————————
And that rod of the heavens she
mentioned... I'm sure it has
something to do with the word that
breaks the seal.
———————————————
Hmm... Isn't there any way to
restore her memory? I'm certain it
would help us figure this all out...
———————————————
Hey, hey! Where exactly might you
be going, [Link]?
———————————————
UNNNYARA MUNNYARA HANYARA PINYARA...
———————————————
EEEEEEEEEK!
———————————————
Hrrph hrrph hrrph! Long, long ago I
predicted that you would come,
my brother.
———————————————
But tell me, did you not see my
young one in trouble in Castle Town?
———————————————
He has been stuck standing there,
for he cannot get any hot
springwater. Alas, the east Castle
Town bridge remains broken...
———————————————
Perhaps his fortunes will turn,
for it looks like the Malo Mart is
raising money to repair the bridge.
This is a fine thing, my brother.
———————————————
Perhaps you might consider a
contribution to their fund-raising
to help me and mine?
———————————————
Tell me, my brother, did you not
see a young Goron in trouble in
Castle Town?
———————————————
I would go to his aid in a moment,
but with that bridge still needing
repairs, it is impossible...
———————————————
Tell me, my brother, did you not
see a young Goron in Castle Town?
———————————————
He has yet to come back, even
though they say the east gate
bridge is fixed...
———————————————
Perhaps you could look in on him
for me, my brother?
———————————————
Tell me, my brother, do you not
know of a young Goron in Castle
Town?
———————————————
I suspect he is currently hanging
his head somewhere near the
east gate.
———————————————
Here is the plan, my brother: I will
prepare some hot springwater, and
you will douse that young one to
revitalize him.
———————————————
Hrrph. It is you, my brother.
———————————————
What do you say? Will you do it?
———————————————
Here is the plan, my brother: I will
prepare some hot springwater, and
you will douse the young one near
Castle Town to revitalize him.
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
Hrrph hrrph hrrph! You failed,
did you not? I am farsighted in
all things, my brother!
———————————————
All right. I will prepare more hot
springwater for you, and you will
douse the young one near Castle
Town to revitalize him.
———————————————
Hrrph... It is a hard world, my
brother...
———————————————
We Gorons have a strong sense of
duty, so I am sure there will be
something good to come of it
at a later time...
———————————————
Oh... I see! I am counting on you
to make the run, my brother!
———————————————
Hot springwater cools as time
passes, so if you do not hurry,
you will end up with plain old
cold water, my brother!
———————————————
The Malo Mart here is raising
funds to repair the bridge, my
brother.
———————————————
Perhaps you could make a donation
to assist?
———————————————
That face... Did you see my young
one?
———————————————
Hrrph hrrph hrrph! I am farsighted
when it comes to all of your
travels, my brother!
———————————————
Until the east Castle Town bridge
is fixed, you cannot get hot
springwater to him.
———————————————
Could you perhaps contribute to
Malo Mart's fund-raising first?
———————————————
You...made a donation, did you
not? I am farsighted in all things,
my brother!
———————————————
Tell me, do you know of my young
one in Castle Town?
———————————————
But it is strange... Even though
they say the bridge has been
repaired, my young one in Castle
Town fails to return...
———————————————
I am sure he is hanging his head
somewhere around the east gate
right at this moment.
———————————————
Even though they say the bridge
has been repaired, my young one
in Castle Town fails to return...
———————————————
Could you perhaps go check up on
the young Goron in Castle Town for
me, my brother?
———————————————
Did you go see the young Goron in
Castle Town?
———————————————
Hrrph hrrph hrrph! I am farsighted
in all things, my brother!
———————————————
You really did me a favor the
other day, my brother!
———————————————
It seems my young one in Castle
Town has been revitalized and
has resumed his business!
———————————————
Life has returned to both this
village and Castle Town!
Hrrph hrrph hrrph!
———————————————
Is... Is your name [Link]?
———————————————
My mother came to me in a dream...
She showed me your image.
———————————————
She spoke of a youth who would
save our domain and steer my fate.
One named [Link].
———————————————
I must thank you for all you've
done.
———————————————
If there is anything I can ever do
for you, please tell me.
———————————————
Please...
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
I have so little confidence...
———————————————
What can I do? I could not even
carry out one simple task for my
mother...
———————————————
I am so unlike her... I doubt I am
even qualified to rule...
———————————————
Hmm... The beast-man of the snowy
mountain...perhaps?
———————————————
But more important is this red fish
it is holding...

———————————————
It must be a reekfish. That is a rare
specimen found only in the Zora
village.
———————————————
It feeds on a valuable type of coral,
and without that bait, even our
best fishers cannot catch one.
———————————————
Look closely, [Link]...
My earring is made of this coral.
———————————————
I would like to give it to you.
———————————————
I received it from my mother...
———————————————
But it is fine. I no longer need it.
———————————————
As I look at you, I get a sense of
what my mother wanted, what I
should be doing now...
———————————————
I will return to my village.
———————————————
The reekfish can be found near the
Mother-and-Child Rocks in the
waterfall basin near my village.
———————————————
The fish are red, so I think you
should be able to spot them...
———————————————
The reekfish can be found near the
Mother-and-Child Rocks in the
waterfall basin near my village.
———————————————
The fish are red, so you should
definitely be able to spot them.
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
What would my mother have
thought of me?
———————————————
I still have so little confidence
in myself...
———————————————
What can a pitiful Zora like me do?
———————————————
I am not sure I can be of any use
at all......
———————————————
...Can I?
———————————————
Do you know about the new
product, the water bomb?
———————————————
They're so superb, Brother, that
you can use them underwater!
If you don't have any yet, you
should buy some!
———————————————
But enough about that, Brother...
———————————————
Welcome to Barnes Bomb Shop!
From simple bombs to exotic ones,
we have all kinds, Brother!
———————————————
But enough about that, Brother...
———————————————
Hmm? What is it?
———————————————
Listen to that spirit!
———————————————
So, they've even spread to places
like this... Hurry up and polish
them off!
———————————————
It looks like there's someone in the
sanctuary. Are you sure we
shouldn't drop in?
———————————————
We're going all the way back to that
village again?!
———————————————
And a human like you can't warp,
either... What a pain.
———————————————
Ooh! If you could catch this horse,
we'd have a MUCH easier time
getting back to that village!
———————————————
Hang on tight with [+] so you don't
get thrown clear!
———————————————
We're going straight to that guy
Bo's place, right?
———————————————
You're going to help them in any
case, right? Not that I care that
much one way or the other.
Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Isn't that the power of the Zoras
they were talking about? If it's
something we can get our hands
on...then shouldn't we get it?
———————————————
There it is! See! Take a good look!
———————————————
Hmm... He said the altar moves.
What does THAT mean? [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Get out of here, NOW!
———————————————
A cannon, huh?
———————————————
What do you plan to do with this,
[Link]?
———————————————
[.]Warp
[.]Talk to Midna
———————————————
You might figure something out if
you try to move it... Oh, what to
do, what to do?
———————————————
I'll carry it for you. I don't mind.
Why don't we show it to someone
who might know something
about it?
———————————————
...Except that guy's still watching
us...
———————————————
What's wrong? I was so impressed
with how nicely you jumped up
there, and then you had to go and
ruin it by falling down!
———————————————
If you want to overcome a wild
beast, watch its movements and
match them with [<][+][>], then press
[A] at the right time to subdue it.

That's my advice for learning how
to master a wolf that just won't
listen...[sfx] Eee hee!

I am little more than a flying toy.
People use me day in and day out...
———————————————
I just want to be a regular Cucco!
...That's why I ran away from my
master.
———————————————
The people here are kind. They do
not play roughly with me.
———————————————
But I have to say, I do get a little
lonely sometimes...
———————————————
And look, isn't this town full of
nice flying spots?
———————————————
Ahhh... If only someone would
play with me...
———————————————
Ahhh! I need more flying!

I am so stressed out, I am

flown here in a great escape from

I brought a lot from the mountain,
Brother! Different stuff from the

Phase One: Repair the broken
bridge leading from west Castle
Town to the field in order to
improve traffic!
———————————————
Glorious day! We have collected
enough funds to finance repairs to
the bridge connecting west Castle
Town to Hyrule Field, Brudda!
———————————————
Power has returned to the
Dominion Rod! This mystical
rod breathes life into ancient
statues.
Set it to [B] on the ["-"] screen,
then aim it with [W] and swing it
with [B] to make statues mimic
your moves.

He has been stuck standing there,

F@
———————————————
And then...the human supposedly
won, Brother!
———————————————
Really, Brother?! Who would have ever
thought THAT could happen...
———————————————
Sitting in a hot spring warms up your
body and soul...and gradually fills you
up with energy, Brother.
———————————————
Even Gorons need to cleanse their
spirits once in a while...
———————————————
Sitting in an open-air bath at night is
the best, Brother!  I could spend
countless hours here looking at the
stars! Ahhhhhhhhh!
———————————————
Morning baths are the best! I love
greeting the sunrise from the tub,
Brother!
———————————————
Morning baths are the best, Brother!
Nothing tastes better than after-bath
breakfast!
———————————————
Open-air baths are the best, Brother!
From now on, it is afternoon bath first,
THEN afternoon nap!
———————————————
Open-air baths are the best, Brother!
Nibbling on an evening meal of rock
sirloin in the tub is like nothing else!
———————————————
Oh, and have you heard? Just the
other day, a human finally beat the
elder!
———————————————
Incredible, Brother... That must have
been one monster of a human!
———————————————
Just once, I would like to get a look at
his face!
———————————————
Ugh... Why do I have to stand guard...
———————————————
The ladder is destroyed, so it is not
like any humans will come up...
———————————————
And what is with the elders? If we
have a problem the humans can help
with, we should ask. It is better than
suffering for the sake of pride.
———————————————
Repelling humans by force... What a
depressing job...
———————————————
Why do I have to stand guard at a
dead end at the bottom of a cliff like
this...
———————————————
...Wait a second! Have they tucked me
out of the way because they think I
am useless?
———————————————
Grrr! I do not like being made an
outcast on the fringes like this...
———————————————
If I see anyone suspicious, I am going
to show my strength. Yes, I will send
the trespasser flying!
———————————————
Psssh! Hot! Another fumarole... And
once again, it is in the worst possible
place!
———————————————
I suppose this path is impassable
now...
———————————————
If I were to go down that way...I would
get knocked back in an instant. I am
sure of it!
———————————————
If my legs were as strong as the
elders' legs, I might be able to stomp
my way down there...
———————————————
I must always remember that this path
connects to a very important place.
———————————————
No human outsider must pass!
———————————————
This elevator leads straight to the hot
spring, Brother! Just use your weight
to activate the switch!
———————————————
Hey! Wait up, Brother!
———————————————
If you are headed down, I recommend
using this elevator!
———————————————
Try again later, Brother...
———————————————
Oh ho ho... Just being powerful is
nothing special, Brother.
———————————————
If you feel anger, then try again,
Brother! But I doubt the outcome will
change! 
———————————————
What? You are giving up, Brother?
Bah! Leave, then.
———————————————
Your body is skinny, Brother, and so
you are too light. You do not stand a
chance.
———————————————
There have been few sumo matches
lately... Talk about boring, Brother.
———————————————
I suppose it is because young Gorons
these days have no interest in old arts
like sumo.
———————————————
And former powerhouse Gor Coron is
an elder... There is not much we can
do, Brother.
———————————————
Without sumo matches, the hot spring
is the only thing we have to look
forward to, Brother.
———————————————
Master! Did you hear? There was a
sumo match for the first time in
forever!
———————————————
I heard, Little Brother! I heard!
I heard an elder fought a human!
———————————————
I do not know how it turned out.
Do you know who won, Master?
———————————————
Of course the elder won, Little
Brother! He sent his opponent flying
with one mighty blow!
———————————————
I knew it! The weight difference
between humans and Gorons is just
too great!

———————————————
Did you hear, Master? It seems there
was another sumo match...
———————————————
Yes, I heard the same human
challenged the elder and was sent
flying, Little Brother.
———————————————
It is good to have spirit, but it means
little if you do not win, Master!
———————————————
Of course the elder won, Little
Brother! But it sounds like it was a
good match...
———————————————
Oh ho ho! Pretty tough for a human!
———————————————
I heard from the elder, Brother! We
are supposed to let you go up
anytime!
———————————————
You want to go up? 
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
All right! Get up on my back, Brother!
———————————————
Anytime you want to go up, I will send
you flying, Brother!
———————————————
You cannot go any farther unless the
elder gives his permission.
———————————————
The elder has given his permission,
so you are welcome to enter, Brother.
———————————————
No entry without the elder's
permission, human.
———————————————
Since you are going inside, please
rescue our patriarch, Brother!
———————————————
Urrgh...There is no way a puny
creature like you could be a match
for us!
———————————————
Who would have imagined the elder
losing...
———————————————
I know! The elder let you win! There
is no other way a tiny thing like you
could have won!
———————————————
This is no place for humans! Away
with you!
———————————————
These mines are sacred ground that
even we rarely enter, Brother.
———————————————
But we do not have the strength to
save the patriarch... We have no
choice, Brother...
———————————————
Unless you cheat or use some dirty
tricks, you have no chance.
———————————————
And if you do cheat...you will pay
dearly.
———————————————
You... Did you really win? Without
cheating?
———————————————
If I find out that you cheated, human,
you will pay.
———————————————
The fact that the guards could not
stop one puny human from getting in
here is a humiliation for all Gorons.
———————————————
The fact that you got by so many
Gorons to get here was shocking...but
to beat the elder... I am in utter
disbelief.
———————————————
Neither humans nor Gorons should
make judgments based on appearance,
I suppose...
———————————————
If you do not leave, I will take the
elder's place and give you a thumping
you will not forget.
———————————————
I am glad we heeded the elder's
words and did not attack you, Brother.
———————————————
It might have been we who were sent
flying...
———————————————
The elder, Gor Coron, was the tribe's
patriarch before Darbus, Brother.
———————————————
He may be old, but if you do not treat
him with respect, you will pay dearly
for it.
———————————————
You defeated the elder, so it is
possible you may be able to save our
patriarch, Brother...
———————————————
Please, Brother! Help the Goron
tribe...and all of Death Mountain!
———————————————
Ah! No humans allowed!
———————————————
These lands ahead belong to the
Goron tribe! The elder said no humans
may pass!
———————————————
Ho! You are back again, human?
———————————————
You will never pass! You cannot hope
to match our brute force!
 
———————————————
A weak spirit is no match for the
might of the Gorons!
———————————————
Do you understand me, human?
Then away with you!
———————————————
Ahhhh... Sumo truly is the best!
———————————————
Haaaa... Now if only the young Gorons
would gain an interest in sumo...
———————————————
You really helped us, Brother... I will
never forget the debt we owe you!
———————————————
We overestimated our strength and
lost our precious mine...
———————————————
We must be more levelheaded so this
never happens again.
———————————————
Ahhhhh... It has been a while, but the
hot spring is as sweet as ever,
Brother!
———————————————
I went down to Castle Town some
time ago, but the bad air made me
too tired...
———————————————
I do not mind telling you, I have had
enough of the bodyguard business,
Brother. No more.
———————————————
I am just going to plant myself right
here in the hot spring!
———————————————
There have been a lot more visitors
to the hot spring lately, Brother.
———————————————
Ahhhh... I am glad to see so many
tribes have learned to love hot
springs, Brother.
———————————————
There have been many more visitors
to the hot spring lately, Brother.
———————————————
Ahhhhh... One day, Brother, I hope
the hot spring will be used not just by
Gorons, but by many different tribes.
———————————————
Must keep humans out...
———————————————
ENOUGH!
———————————————
Is this young one such an imposing
enemy that you must all gang up on
him? I think not, Little Brothers.
———————————————
I am a Goron elder, little human.
I am called Gor Coron.
———————————————
Because of certain...circumstances,
I must lead the Goron tribe in place of
Darbus, our tribal patriarch.
———————————————
Tell me, little human, do you come
from the village below?
———————————————
You have done well to come this far.
You are strong...for a human.
———————————————
However...
———————————————
The mines beyond here are sacred to
my tribe. Outsiders are not allowed.
Unless...
———————————————
I could make an exception...but you
would have to beat me in a contest
of power. Are you willing to try that,
little human?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
Attention, Little Brothers.
———————————————
The human with the pointed hat is
going home.
———————————————
Be polite and see him on his way.
———————————————
Eh? What is it? Do you want to try
again, little human?
———————————————
You think you are tough, do you?
Let us find out.
———————————————
You again, little human? What are you
doing back here?
———————————————
Ah, this is good to hear. I must tell
you, little human, your light frame is
not built for taking on Gorons.
———————————————
All right, Little Brothers, see the
human off, please.
———————————————
What? What is it you need now, little
human?
———————————————
Do you truly want this? You truly plan
to cinch up your belt and challenge
me, little human?
———————————————
You have asked for it, little human.
And now you will get it.
———————————————
You again, little human? What are you
doing back here?
———————————————
[.]Challenge!
[.]Retreat!
———————————————
Bah... Do not waste my time, little
human. Leave immediately.
———————————————
Young warrior... You have a strong
will...and sharp eyes.
———————————————
Fine traits... Want to see how well you
can use them?
———————————————
You have seen it, I would bet... The
mountain, erupting without pause...
———————————————
When the mountain began to rage,
all four of us elders and Darbus, our
patriarch, went inside to investigate
its anger.
———————————————
We have a treasure that was entrusted
to us by the spirits, and we must
protect it. Do you understand?
———————————————
But the moment Darbus reached out
and touched the treasure...everything
went wrong.
———————————————
He collapsed...and before our very
eyes transformed into an unspeakable
monster!
———————————————
He began to rage through the mines,
trailing ruin behind him...and the
eruptions grew more frequent and
more severe.
———————————————
We used all of our strength to seal
him deep inside the mountain...
———————————————
It...grieved us to do this to our
patriarch...but we had no other course
of action.
———————————————
I ask this favor of you, young warrior...
Go to the aid of Darbus!
———————————————
Make no mistake, the spirits have
guided you here.
———————————————
I, Gor Coron, need your help...
———————————————
On behalf of my entire clan, I ask you
for your aid!
———————————————
...You two!
———————————————
Let the young warrior pass.
———————————————
The mines are full of traps, all placed
to protect the treasure from thieves.
———————————————
And worse than traps... Since the
eruptions began, foul creatures of all
shapes have settled into every corner
of the mines.
———————————————
Getting to the patriarch's location will
not be easy. I would prepare your
blade, young warrior.
———————————————
Young warrior! The patriarch
wandered home as if nothing had ever
happened!
———————————————
It seems he remembers nothing of the
events in the mines...
———————————————
I feel you deserve his thanks, but...
give him some time. He is proud, and
I do not wish him further anguish.
———————————————
We will honor our debt to you,
though. If you find trouble, we will do
our part to help you. That is a
promise, young warrior!
———————————————
You have my word: we will repay you
for rescuing our patriarch!
———————————————
If you find trouble, young warrior, we
will come to your aid!
———————————————
It pleases me that the young girl got
her memory back.
———————————————
It also pleases me that we were able
to give you aid, young warrior. Even if
it was just a little.
———————————————
Speaking of which... That girl is the
daughter of Bo from Ordon Village,
is she not?
———————————————
He and I would often wrestle when we
were young. Ah... Such good
memories!
———————————————
I must confess, young warrior, I am
surprised a lug like Bo could sire such
a cute daughter.
———————————————
It is fortunate she resembles her
mother so much!
———————————————
Hey, little human! The elder told me
of your deeds. Good work!
———————————————
I heard that girl got her memory back.
That is good news, huh?
———————————————
You are a tough human to make it
back from the Bygone Village!
———————————————
Since you have come all this way, you
must try the hot spring!
———————————————
Huh? What is it, little human? Do you
need something from me?
———————————————
The patriarch of the Goron tribe is
Darbus...and that is ME!
———————————————
I heard some monsters slipped
through our defenses while I was...
distracted...and attacked Kakariko.
———————————————
But do not worry, little human.
I have sent some Gorons down to help
the villagers.
———————————————
Looks like the Hero's weapon came in
handy...
———————————————
The world does not appear to be
peaceful enough for us to store it
away and not use it.
———————————————
Your journey must have purpose,
young human, so you should bear it
with you.
———————————————
Urrr... I am...confused...
———————————————
I must have slept for a long time in the
mines...
———————————————
Perhaps a bath will revive me...
———————————————
Ahhhh... Nice and hot. Just like I like
it...
———————————————
What? What is a human doing here?
———————————————
I thought the elders told us not to let
humans near the mountain, but...
———————————————
I suppose it is no business of mine.
Come into the hot spring and refresh
yourself, Brother!
———————————————
I heard there is also a hot spring down
at the base of the mountain, in
Kakariko Village.
———————————————
When the day comes that we can
travel freely between the mountain
and the village, I would love to try it
out for myself!
———————————————
Darbus has returned from his retreat
in the mines...
———————————————
We have permission to travel to
Kakariko Village once again, so I plan
to put together a hot-spring tour,
Brother!
———————————————
I visited the hot springs in Kakariko
Village the other day, Brother.
———————————————
It was a pretty nice place, but I have
to say I prefer the spacious spring we
have here!
———————————————
So... I heard you helped out the
patriarch, Brother.
———————————————
The other day I chased you off without
listening to what you had to say...
Please, accept my apology, Brother!
———————————————
If you are going up the mountain, I will
launch you as high as I can, Brother! 
———————————————
Thanks to you, the mountain paths
are all open and safe, Brother.
———————————————
Some of my fellow Gorons went to
check on Kakariko Village.
———————————————
We owe you much...
———————————————
When things calm down a bit, I will
travel to Kakariko and help, too.
———————————————
Darbus and the elders have been
charged with seeing how Kakariko
Village is faring, young human.
———————————————
There is no cause for alarm, however.
I am on watch while everyone is gone!
———————————————
Those scoundrels Gor Ebizo and Gor
Liggs went to Kakariko Village and
have not come back, young human.
———————————————
Their absence is strange, for I have
heard from Darbus that Kakariko
Village is safe now...
———————————————
Perhaps they just enjoy it there!
———————————————
Gor Ebizo and Gor Liggs have gone to
Kakariko Village, young human!
———————————————
I have heard they are helping out with
the sales of many things...
———————————————
They are both getting long in the
tooth... I wonder if they are any help
at all...
———————————————
Oh ho ho! Well done, young human!
———————————————
I should tell you, I had a hunch you
would assist us.
———————————————
Now then... It is my turn to show you
my gratitude!
———————————————
Greetings, Brother!
———————————————
Pick up your hot-spring souvenirs
right here! [+][>]
———————————————
Listen, Brother, you have no bow, so
do not waste your time with arrows!
———————————————
Your quiver is full, Brother. Return
when you use some arrows!
———————————————
It's 10 Rupees[ 8C] for [ 8C]10 arrows. Are you
buying, Brother? 
———————————————
It's[ 8C] 10 Rupees[ 8C] for [ 8C]10 arrows. If you do
not have the Rupees, Brother, then
you will not have the arrows!
———————————————
[.]Buy
[.]Quit
———————————————
Greetings again, Brother!
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees. Are you
buying, Brother? 
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern oil is 20 Rupees. If you do not
have the Rupees, Brother, then you
will not have the oil!
———————————————
I cannot pour you any oil unless you
have an empty bottle or a lantern that
is not full, Brother!
———————————————
You still have some oil left, but do you
want to fill up anyway? The price is
still 20 Rupees, but... 
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk is 20 Rupees[ 8C] for [ 8C]two servings.
Are you buying, Brother? 
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk is 20 Rupees[ 8C] for [ 8C]two servings.
If you do not have the Rupees,
Brother, then you will not have the
milk!
———————————————
I cannot sell you [ 8C]milk unless you have
an empty bottle, Brother!
———————————————
Greetings again, Brother! Let me fill
your bottle with milk!
———————————————
Greetings again, Brother! Let me fill
your empty bottle with oil!
———————————————
Greetings again, Brother! Let me fill
your lantern with oil!
———————————————
Stop by whenever you visit the hot
spring, Brother!
———————————————
Try [+][>] to see the merchandise,
Brother!
———————————————
A [ 8C]wooden shield costs[ 8C] 50 Rupees,
Brother. Are you buying?
———————————————
A [ 8C]wooden shield is 50 Rupees,[ 8C]
Brother! If you do not have the
Rupees, you will not have the shield!
———————————————
Brother... Carrying around more
than one of the same kind of shield
just makes for extra baggage...
———————————————
Brother... Even though it may look
different, if you already have a
shield, carrying around another
one just makes for extra baggage.
———————————————
It is always hot when I come here...
———————————————
At this rate, I will be sun dried in no
time...
———————————————
Ahhh...
That's the stuff...
———————————————
Uh... I have been here too long...
———————————————
I am practicing holding my breath, so
do not bother me, Brother!
———————————————
...But no matter how much time
passes, I never feel the need to
inhale! It is strange...
———————————————
You saw me? I am surprised you
noticed me!
———————————————
[ 8C]Wooden Shield   50 Rupees
It is wood, so if it catches fire, it may
burn up. Still, life without a shield
is dangerous for a human!
———————————————
[ 8C]Milk (2 servings) 20 Rupees
Chugging a glass of milk after soaking
in the hot spring is very popular,
Brother!
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern Oil  20 Rupees
The mountains are dark at night,
Brother! Make sure you have enough 
oil!
———————————————
[ 8C]Arrows (10)  10 Rupees
There are few shops in the area. If you
use a bow, carry lots of arrows,
Brother.
———————————————
Whoa... This looks dangerous...
———————————————
Is this the traditional Death Mountain
welcome?[sfx] Eee hee!
———————————————
This thing has been here for a while
now, but it's still pretty hot...
———————————————
As big and as hot as it is, it just might
be enough to melt the ice in Zora's
Domain, don't you think?
———————————————
If you wanted to use it for something,
I could use my powers to remove it,
but...
———————————————
[.]Warp
[.]Speak to Midna
———————————————
Wh-What?
———————————————
Aaargh! Do something, will you! Those
village fools must know SOMETHING!
———————————————
There's no reason to be here, is
there?
———————————————
We're going to that Bo person's place
this INSTANT!
———————————————
Now that I think of it, something
rather large DID fall from the sky,
didn't it? [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Hey, did you just see that Goron
use another Goron's back as a
springboard to jump really high?
———————————————
So...maybe you could just use the
back of one of those nice Gorons
if you need to jump, too!
———————————————
What was that?! You can do better
than that! Face the right way and go!
———————————————
See, these guys may look huge, but
they're not so big.

———————————————
Please, you must leave quickly...
before the guard comes.
———————————————
Hmm... Looks like you come from
decent stock, huh?
———————————————
With your lineage, I think you
qualify to be my official steed!
Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Huh? What's that?
———————————————
Try pressing [L]. After that... Well,
you'll figure it out.
———————————————
Right, that's the way. If you ever
need help, just press [Z] to call me.
———————————————
As long as you're a good boy, I'll
be happy to lend a hand!
———————————————
What are you doing?! Do you ever
try just looking down?
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! Awww, did the detour tire
you out, little wolf?
———————————————
You want out of here, right? OK!
We're off!
———————————————
By the way, do you...have any idea
where we are? [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Well... Maybe you'll figure it out
once we get up top.
———————————————
Look! Just a little farther!
———————————————
What're you doing? C'mon!
Let's go!
———————————————
If you want to get out of here,
you'd better be a good boy and do
as I say!
———————————————
Hmmm... The water's dropped...
Oh, well.
———————————————
Huh? I can't remember which way
we were supposed to go...
———————————————
Hey! Why don't you do a little
looking yourself, you lazy wolf!
———————————————
Ugh! That STENCH! Why are we
lingering in such a nasty place?
———————————————
Come on! What's the matter with
you? Get over here, now!
———————————————
If you can't force your way out,
why don't you see if there's some
kind of hole you can squeeze
through?
———————————————
I mean, places like this are always
full of holes, right?
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! Awww, did the detour tire
you out, little wolf?
———————————————
If you want to get out of here, you
be a good boy! You do exactly as I
say!
———————————————
Come on! Press [L]! Stop wasting
time!
———————————————
Come on! Let's get out of here!
———————————————
When I see a spot to jump to, I'll
let you know, so respond quickly
by pressing [Z]. You got that?
———————————————
If you'll be a good boy, I'll help
you again.
———————————————
We're almost there, so quit yapping
and get moving!
———————————————
Quit wasting time! RUN!
———————————————
I guess I have to do EVERYTHING
for you...
———————————————
Look, I'll show you all the small
ledges, so just [L]-target me and
press [A] to jump to where I am!
———————————————
Phew... Finally made it to the top!
———————————————
Look! We're almost outside. Why
don't you try to find some footing
we can use to climb up?
———————————————
Ugh... What are you doing?
———————————————
Go find the tallest tower, OK?
———————————————
I'll introduce you to someone very
interesting...
———————————————
Oh... Well, well...
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee hee! Want to see
something interesting?
———————————————
You're a beast, remember? Press [X]
to hone your senses and poke
around!
———————————————
Huff... Huff... Can't...run...any...
farther... That's...far enough...
right? I'll be safe here...I think...
———————————————
What was that noise?! Don't...
Don't anything come near me!
———————————————
What are these black things...
Where are they coming from...


And how do we get out of here?!
———————————————
So, we were finally able to get out.



And look at the sky! Isn't the black
cloud of twilight looking beautiful
today?
———————————————
Do you know where this is? You
STILL don't know? [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Look, there's someone I want to
introduce you to...but I'll need you
to go to that tower to do it!
———————————————
[Link]... Go... Hurry...
———————————————
To...Zelda... Hu-Hurry...
———————————————
I doubt you're used to your new
body yet, so I'll just tell you...
———————————————
Think about how you fought
enemies in your human form...
———————————————
Just because your shape has
changed doesn't mean your
instincts have as well!
———————————————
By the way... Are you using [X] to
hone your senses like you should?
———————————————
It looks like the spirits in here...
They're all soldiers.
———————————————
Where in the world could we be?
[sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
That was a soldier's spirit.
———————————————
Maybe it's someone from the
other world? [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
There are lots of other spirits
roaming about here, you know.
Hone your senses with [X] to see
them. They might know things...
———————————————
So there are even spirits up here,
huh?
———————————————
This whole spirit thing is pretty
new to you, isn't it?
———————————————
Even though these guys can see
those monsters, they don't know
a thing about you!
———————————————
If you think I'm lying, why don't
you check it out? Use [X] to hone
your fine senses... [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
What are these black monsters...
I've never seen anything like
them...
———————————————
Please...I am but a lowly soldier.
———————————————
Please...someone save me from
these evil creatures... Ahhhh!
———————————————
What... What are these monstrous
birds? What in the world is
happening here?
———————————————
Ah, our poor Hyrule Castle!
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee! That wasn't the person
I wanted you to meet, by the way...
———————————————
Well, let's just try and get to that
tower.
———————————————
What are you doing?! Get outside!
———————————————
...Look, I don't have time for us to
just sit around here.
———————————————
Now hurry up and press [L] next
to the chain!
———————————————
Oooh! Well, if it isn't from Renado,
the shaman!
———————————————
All this writing, and he doesn't
bother to mention a thing about
little ol' me? Honey, that is what I
call RUDE!
———————————————
Well, there's no accounting for the
foolishness of a man. And at least I
understand Ilia's situation now.
———————————————
Of course I can lend a hand for that
adorable little girl!
———————————————
Hmmm, what else do I know...
The first one to bring Ilia to this
shop was that doctor...
———————————————
Maybe he knows something, but
he's a crusty old bat, that's for
sure...
———————————————
Ah... I've got it! Honey, you go
ahead and take this to him. This
magic little paper will get that
codger talking!
———————————————
It sure would be nice if she started
remembering things soon, eh,
[Link]?
———————————————
You go ahead and show this to the
medical professor, OK, honey?
Then you'll see its magical effect!
———————————————
Oh my... If it isn't [Link]!
———————————————
You made it! How've you been,
honey?!
———————————————
Mercy, but you have good timing.
I was just talking about you!
———————————————
Hey, everyone! Introduce
yourselves!
———————————————
This handsome young man is the
infamous [Link]!
———————————————
You remember what I told you
before, honey?
———————————————
These are those friends I
mentioned, the ones who are trying
to help deal with all the troubles in
Hyrule.
———————————————
Actually, there's one more of us...
but there's been a disturbing turn
of events in the western desert, so
he's gone to check it out.
———————————————
He's an older man named Auru.
If you happen to meet him,
definitely take the time to talk with
him, OK, honey?
———————————————
Actually there's one more of us...
but there's been a disturbing turn
of events on the north mountain,
so she's gone to check things out.
———————————————
She's a beautiful young lady named
Ashei. If you have a chance to meet
her, you should definitely take the
time to talk to her, OK, honey?
———————————————
Actually, there's one more of us...
but there's been a disturbing turn
of events in the southern wood, so
he's gone to check it out.
———————————————
It's someone you know very well...
He wants to see you, so you 
should go pay a visit, honey!
———————————————
Actually, there's one more of us...
but he's doing a little research in
Kakariko Village.
———————————————
His name's Shad. He's about the
same age as you, I think. If you see
him, you should try talking to him,
honey.
———————————————
Oh... Mercy, how could I forget!
If you're going to Kakariko Village,
be sure to give my regards to that
adorable shaman, OK, honey?
———————————————
Well, you've come all the way here,
honey, so why don't you relax a
bit.
———————————————
Why don't you be sociable and talk
to these folks? They're a jolly
bunch!
———————————————
How's that Ilia doing, honey?
———————————————
I'm sure that shaman will find a way
to get her memory back. That
Renado is a talented man, for sure!
———————————————
Anyway, honey, you've got your
own things to worry about, so you
just make sure you do what needs
doing right now, OK?
———————————————
Leave Ilia to Renado, honey. You've
got your own things to do, so you
just make sure you do what needs
doing right now, OK?
———————————————
Don't you worry, honey! That girl's
memory will come back!
———————————————
But don't just wait around for
things to happen, you hear me?
You make sure you take care of
what needs doing, OK?
———————————————
Listen, honey, if you're puzzled
about what you ought to be doing,
why not go see our friend Auru?
There's a man who knows things!
———————————————
Right now he's off investigating
Hyrule's western desert.
———————————————
Now, I'm not doubting you, honey,
but if you're wondering what you
ought to be doing, you ought to go
talk to our friend Ashei.
———————————————
She's up on Hyrule's northern
mountain checking things out, and
she's got good instincts, trust me.
———————————————
Hey, honey, if you're up in the air
about where to go next, maybe you
ought to go talk to Rusl.
———————————————
He's in Hyrule's southern wood
right now, checking out the lay of
the land.
———————————————
You unsure about what you ought
to be doing, honey? Well, why
don't you go show your face in
Kakariko Village?
———————————————
Our friend Shad happens to be
there right now, looking into this
and that.
———————————————
If you need detailed directions,
just take a peek at that map on the
table.
———————————————
I'm sure you'll learn something
good, honey!
———————————————
This boy... Can you save him?!
———————————————
All right, little lady, try to settle
down, OK?! I just now sent for the
doctor!
———————————————
But this is strange... A child of the
Zoras...


I wonder if this is at all related to
the incident the soldiers were
talking about in back...
———————————————
This boy is still so young, so
innocent... To see him suffering
like this...
———————————————
He'll be all right, little lady.
Someone's already gone for the
doctor.
———————————————
I'll tell you, though, from what
those soldiers in back were talking
about...to everything else...
———————————————
There sure has been a rash of
trouble lately...
———————————————
How's it come to this, huh?
Monsters walking in the streets of
town...
———————————————
What in the WORLD are the soldiers
of Hyrule doing?!
———————————————
The Gorons are so much more
reliable than they are, it's not even
funny!
———————————————
What's that, honey?! Ilia's
memory?!
———————————————
Really? Mercy, if that isn't the
BEST news I've heard all day!
———————————————
You did a great job, honey...
———————————————
You take good care of Ilia, you hear
me?
———————————————
But... Then again, I suppose you've
still got a few other things on your
plate right now, don't you?
———————————————
Everyone! Look!
———————————————
[Link]'s come to see us!
———————————————
I'm busy! Bother, bother!
———————————————
Eh? What's that?
———————————————
Just as I wondered who it might be,
I see it's the admirable young lad
who was willing to help the Zora
boy for nary a single Rupee...
———————————————
Just what is it you want, lad?
A physical? You've some money,
don't you?
———————————————
...By the way, that girl Ilia didn't
mention anything about me, did she?
———————————————
AIIIGH!
———————————————
L-Look! I can't pay this off right
now! I can see Telma's hired you
as some sort of heavy to strong-
arm me, but she'll have to wait!
———————————————
Look, lad, if I'd been able to sell
the wooden statue that young lady
had, I would've been able to get
the money...
———————————————
But see, I accidentally spilled
medicine all over that little carving,
which made it stink awfully. I put it
outside to dry...but then...
———————————————
Well, it was stolen.
———————————————
Who goes around stealing people's
stuff like that? What a world! You
always have to be on guard, eh?
———————————————
......
———————————————
...Uh, look, Mr. Heavy, at any rate,
neither the money nor the carving
is here, so I can't repay you.
———————————————
Now, to work, to work...
———————————————
You're a persistent little bug, eh?!
I said I have neither the money nor
the wooden statue, you great lout!
I can't return what I don't have!
———————————————
Ugh! I can't get rid of that medicine
stench, I don't have any money...
When it rains misfortune, it pours!
Remember that, lad!
———————————————
I'll be honest, lad, it'll cost you a
fair bit for an examination.
———————————————
It's not that I'm having trouble
making money... Not at all! Why,
I'm so skilled, they call my hands
"The Golden Mitts"!
———————————————
If you don't have any errand here,
then begone, you scoundrel!
———————————————
...Did she really not say anything at all
about me?
———————————————
If you don't have any money, then
you're just a bother! A bother! And
I'm too busy for bothers!
———————————————
Eh?!
———————————————
The young lady's memory...
returned?!
———————————————
Er... Hmmm...
———————————————
Well... I diagnosed from the
beginning that it would come back
at some point! Yes, I most
certainly did!
———————————————
What's that?! I'm busy!
———————————————
If you've got no money and no
business, then begone, you
layabout!
———————————————
AIIIGH!!!
———————————————
That... That statue...
———————————————
Er... Hmm... Hmmmmph! I haven't
the foggiest notion what that thing
is!
———————————————
Take that thing and go return it to
that girl Ilia, or whatever her name
is!
———————————————
Oooh.......
———————————————
Hmm... Hmmph! I haven't the
foggiest notion what that thing is!
———————————————
I haven't seen any statue that
belongs to an Ilia, or whatever her
name was!
———————————————
You're looking for the wooden
statue that Ilia had, aren't you,
dear?
———————————————
Think it's a coincidence that I
happen to know it got stolen from
the doctor's place? No...
———————————————
Yes, I'll admit it...I took it. But then
I was attacked by some sort of
skeletal dog beasts who took it
from me.
———————————————
I don't know why those beasts were
after her statue... I thought it likely
that she was in a dangerous spot,
though.
———————————————
Those fiends lurk just outside the
southern gate... Unfortunately,
they only come out at night.
———————————————
...And another thing... They always
move around as a pack. You won't
get that statue back unless you
give them all a thrashing...
———————————————
That statue sounds like a key to
getting Ilia's memory back... You
must get it back!
———————————————
That girl won't recover her memory
if you don't defeat those dog
beasts outside the southern gate
and get that statue back.
———————————————
Those fiends travel in a pack at
night! Be careful out there!
———————————————
Get that statue back and get it to
Ilia as quickly as you can!
———————————————
You there!
———————————————
You're [Link], correct?
———————————————
Mmm, yes, I thought so. I could
just tell, you know.
———————————————
I'm Louise. Do you remember
meeting me in this shop before?
Though I don't think we were
properly introduced...
———————————————
In any case, I must tell you, I'm a
bit puzzled as to why you look like
that.
———————————————
Really, dear, you can't blame the
humans for tossing you out, the
way you look.
———————————————
Oh... Another patient? You
certainly are a curious sort...
———————————————
...Plea... Please...
———————————————
Princess...Z-Zelda...
———————————————
This way!
———————————————
Here, get in through the window.
The attic is connected to the
castle's waterway.
———————————————
It's an old waterway, though...so it
could be a rough trip.
———————————————
Well... I suppose all that's left to
do is make sure that the humans
don't notice you.
———————————————
What? They kicked you out again?
———————————————
Difficult to be stealthy when one is so
bulky, I'd imagine...
———————————————
Be careful where the footing's not
stable or you'll fall, dear.
———————————————
Do walk carefully when you move
around the attic.
———————————————
Mmm... I see you've found a way
up to the window...
———————————————
The passage to the castle is deep
within the bar. Go through the
window!
———————————————
You must make sure the humans
downstairs don't detect you!
———————————————
Shouldn't you hurry to the castle,
dear? Use the window and find the
passage in the back of the attic!
———————————————
Are you so heavy...that you can't
jump high enough? Oh my.
———————————————
There must be another way to climb
in! Think!
———————————————
......Can I help you?
———————————————
...Would you like me to show
something to you? [+][>]
———————————————
Excuse me... Are you looking for
something? [+][>]
———————————————
Oh... How awful to be you.
———————————————
What do you think?
———————————————
[.]I'll take it.
[.]No, thank you.

......
———————————————
It has been a long time...
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
My wife, Uli, sent word to me.
I have seen the children in Kakariko
Village!
———————————————
And, of course, I have also heard of
your adventures!
———————————————
I must thank you for your help with
Colin, [Link].
———————————————
I barely recognized him... In any
case, I am troubled by my own
inaction. I want to help the cause.
———————————————
These friends here... I have had a
connection with them for a long
while.
———————————————
Like the others, I am gathering
information now. I will let you know
if I hear anything.
———————————————
So? Did you find the power of the
ancient civilization?
———————————————
If you discover anything, could you
be sure to also tell Shad?
———————————————
He has been researching the
Oocca, who are said to be the
ancestors of the Hylians.
———————————————
As we speak, he is in Kakariko
Village investigating these sky
beings. Perhaps you should go see
him?
———————————————
He is an avid scholar, so I am sure
his knowledge could be helpful.
———————————————
Yes, yes... My golden friend came
in handy, did he not?
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
We must restore the peace and
take the children home with us!
———————————————
I am gathering information now,
as well, so I will let you know if I
hear something.
———————————————
What to order, what to order...
I do believe I will start with meat.
———————————————
Oh... Are you a customer?
———————————————
The proprietress is out, so the
bar is closed... Did you not see the
sign outside?
———————————————
Would you mind leaving for now?
———————————————
You still need something?
———————————————
Do you think I would be troubled
by a young man wandering
recklessly in here?
———————————————
Unless you work harder at honing
your skills, all that equipment you
have won't do you any good.
———————————————
Say... [Link]! You're alive
and well!
———————————————
Tell me, did you find anything of
interest at the Arbiter's Grounds
in the desert?
———————————————
The sages... Those sages once
served the royal family, actually.
They were appointed as tutors to
the young Princess Zelda.
———————————————
It was from them that I first heard
tales of the accursed mirror in the
Arbiter's Grounds.
———————————————
Did you see the sad state of Hyrule
Castle?
———————————————
It's the urgent desire of this group
of ours to restore peace to this
kingdom as swiftly as possible.
———————————————
[Link]... Please continue to
lend us your strength!
———————————————
Well, what have we here, hm?
That's quite an outfit you have on,
old boy.
———————————————
That timeless design... You're
sporting the legendary hero
LOOK, aren't you?
———————————————
Tell me, where did you buy it?
Wait... Please don't tell me you
made it YOURSELF?!
———————————————
Oh, dear. I'd love to wear
something like that!
———————————————
Pray tell, if you were to ever tire of
that thing, would you part with it?
———————————————
Mister HERO! ...Heh heh.
———————————————
Oh, hello there! You must be
[Link], correct?
———————————————
I'm Shad. Wonderful to meet you.
———————————————
Sorry about the ribbing I gave you
the other day, old boy.
———————————————
This town is rather teeming with
odd sorts, so I was just being
careful.
———————————————
Telma told me all you've been up
to. You're rather formidable!
———————————————
I'm rather NOT, I'm afraid. Well, I'm
formidable at book reading, but I
lack, shall we say, physical skills. 
———————————————
That said, if the history and
legends of Hyrule are your cup of
tea, I'm your fellow! If you're
curious, just ask away.
———————————————
At the moment I'm absolutely
entranced by the sky beings known
as the Oocca.
———————————————
Yes, according to legend, Hyrule
was made by the Hylians, who, as
we all know, are the closest race to
the gods.
———————————————
But also according to legend, long
ago there was a race even closer to
the gods, and some say THESE
creatures made the Hylians.
———————————————
When they created the people of
Hylia, they simultaneously created
a new capital, a city that floated in
the heavens.
———————————————
They dwelt there...and some
scholars believe that this race lives
there still, somewhere in the great
sky.
———————————————
Sky beings... Isn't that simply
marvelous, old boy? What I
wouldn't give to meet them!
———————————————
Would you care to hear about the
sky beings again?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
Very well! I'm pleased to have
found another who shares my
passion for the subject.
———————————————
Are you quite sure? I don't mind...
Really?
———————————————
Yes, [Link]...
———————————————
I've been poring over literature
since I saw you last.
———————————————
Thanks to you, I think I've
gradually come to understand
several different aspects of
the riddle of the heavens...
———————————————
If I hadn't met you, I might have
given up trying to bring my father's
dream to fruition...
———————————————
I'm truly grateful for what you have
done. Someday, perhaps, I can
repay this debt.
———————————————
[Link], have you seen the
state Hyrule Castle is in?
———————————————
I feel the same desire to bring
peace to Hyrule. We all do.
———————————————
But right now, it's all we can do
to try to endure...
———————————————
Our chance will surely come!
That's why we both must continue
doing what we can until that time
comes!
———————————————
......
———————————————
...What?
———————————————
...Are you an actor or something?
———————————————
Dressing like the legendary hero...
Wow, gutsy.
———————————————
If you want to get stared at, why
not just join the circus or
something?
———————————————
Looking at your innocent face for 
too long gives me heartburn...
———————————————
How about you not talk to me,
yeah?
———————————————
...It's Ashei.
———————————————
Listen, sorry I was so nasty the
other day.
———————————————
I thought you were like those sorry
excuses for Hyrule soldiers...but I
thought wrong.
———————————————
I grew up in the mountains with my
father, who was a knight in his own
right. He taught me the arts of war
as though I was his son.
———————————————
Of course, lessons in common
courtesy were not part of the
regimen, so forgive me if I come off
as rude, yeah?
———————————————
Listen, before I blab both of your
ears off, I want to tell you
something.
———————————————
Snowpeak, the mountain to the
north of Hyrule... It's unlike any
mountain I've ever known.
———————————————
I don't know much yet, but things
happen there that happen on no
other mountain I know of.
———————————————
...Evil controls it...
———————————————
As soon as I know something more,
I'll tell you. Until then, you should
stay away, yeah?
———————————————
Don't go near Snowpeak for a
while, yeah?
———————————————
I'm looking into it more now, but
trust me, that's no ordinary 
mountain...
———————————————
As soon as I have more
information, I'll let you know, 
yeah?
———————————————
[Link], huh?
———————————————
The beast of Snowpeak hasn't
appeared in Zora's Domain since
its last visit.
———————————————
In the end, the troubles in Hyrule
and the events on Snowpeak were
beyond even my imagination.
———————————————
Honestly... There's got to be
someone who knows what really
happened...
———————————————
[Link], you truly are a 
mysterious guy...
———————————————
No matter where some kind of
incident occurs, your name always
seems to come up!
———————————————
Hey, don't misunderstand me...
I meant that as a compliment,
yeah?
———————————————
As a fellow worker in the fight to
restore peace to Hyrule, you have
my thanks. And may we both keep
up the good work.
———————————————
Heh heh heh... Soon I shall make
a killing off this town...
———————————————
Egads! Wolf!
———————————————
Hey! You idiot! Don't come over
here!
———————————————
Ah-CHOO!
———————————————
I finally get my canine allergy under
control, and now... Ha... Ha...
———————————————
Ah-CHOOOOOOOOO!
Ugh...
———————————————
Shoo! Begone! Go thence!
———————————————
 Excellent, here it comes...
———————————————
Greetings and salutations, good
sir! Welcome to the kingdom of
hopes and fondest dreams!
———————————————
In this place you can taste the life
of a circus star AND get your hands
on gear that boggles minds!
———————————————
It is our EARNEST hope that you
find delight playing the STAR game!
———————————————
The rules are exceedingly simple!
———————————————
Step right up! Shyness, BEGONE!
It's only 10 Rupees! Who's up to
the challenge?!
———————————————
[.]I'll do it.
[.]No, thanks.
———————————————
Oh, my STARS! Shock!
———————————————
Far be it from me to tell you your
business, but if you loaf overmuch,
another's star might rise above
yours!
———————————————
Tarry a moment... I can't shake the
notion that you lack proper
funding! Oh, good sir...
———————————————
Pray, go scrape some Rupees from
betwixt the cushions of your settee
and return posthaste!
———————————————
Many thanks, good sir! The game
will begin once you enter the cage!
May chance favor you! Heh heh heh...
———————————————
Good sir, are you at the ready?!
Then away we GO!
———————————————
Ah ha HA! Shabby luck, good sir!
———————————————
What think you, good sir? The road
to stardom is rather twisty, no?
———————————————
I must tell you, a true star would
be able to fly toward the far-off
mesh!
———————————————
In any case, we very much look
forward to your next attempt at
our humble, but sublime, game!
———————————————
Heh heh... Yes, MANY thanks.
———————————————
...What are you looking at me like
that for? If you want revenge,
it's a mere 10 Rupees!
———————————————
I must tell you, a true star would
be able to fly toward the far-off
mesh!
———————————————
...What are you looking at me like
that for? If you want revenge,
it's a mere 15 Rupees!
———————————————
Im-Impossible...
———————————————
Er... Oh, what a happy day this is!
The debut of a new star! Showers
of applause all around!
———————————————
To the star...I shall give THIS!
———————————————
...Very well! The next stage will be
one created just for YOU, good sir!
———————————————
I would expire should you decline!
Please, you must try it when it is
ready!
———————————————
Pbbbth! I shall remember this...
———————————————
Excellent, good sir!
———————————————
Care to play the STAR game for a
mere 10 Rupees?
———————————————
I'm afraid we require a short
hiatus in order to assemble the
special stage, so we will see you
again soon!
———————————————
Don't forget, you are forsworn to
return! Don't forget!
———————————————
I shall GET you...
———————————————
Oh, fine day! I awaited you, good
sir!
———————————————
The STAR game created with YOU in
mind, good sir... It's a special
arena that costs 15 Rupees a shot!
———————————————
Dare you try it?
———————————————
Ah ha HA! Ill luck, good sir!
———————————————
What think you, good sir? The road
to superstardom is rather wiggly,
no?
———————————————
What the--? You did it...?
———————————————
Oh, what a magnificent day this is!
The debut of a superstar! Let
huzzahs and accolades ring forth!
———————————————
To the superstar...I shall give THIS!
———————————————
Congratulations! Yes, well and
truly! You've claimed what you
sought, so you're likely all
through, hm?
———————————————
Many thanks for playing, good sir!
———————————————
Don't come again...
———————————————
Ugh! You again?!
———————————————
Ugh. Not again...
———————————————
Oh, how fine a day this is! It's you!
How ARE you, good sir?
———————————————
I hesitate to ask, as I know full
well of your superstar status...but
would you care to aim for even
higher?
———————————————
Yes, good sir, for a limited time,
the STAR game will cost, er, well...
20 Rupees!
———————————————
Good sir!
———————————————
Care to play a STAR-game revenge
match for a mere 15 Rupees?!
———————————————
[.]I want revenge!
[.]I'm done.
———————————————
...You wish to go again?
———————————————
Ho ho... Er, stupendous! Indeed!
Revenge can be yours for a mere
20 Rupees!
———————————————
Phew... Close shave.
———————————————
Oh, hey, oh ho ho... How very
unfortunate for us, good sir...
Return anytime!
———————————————
Oh... Oh, what a stupendous day!
You believe you can beat the
record of [var]?!
———————————————
Good sir, are you at the ready?!
Then away we GO!
———————————————
Ah ha HA! Poor luck, good sir!
But try all you like...
———————————————
Curse these jangling nerves...
———————————————
...Do my eyes deceive me?!
———————————————
W-Well played, good sir! I think we
can do nothing but hereby dub
you the only ultrastar in town!
———————————————
Ugh! Blast! Take it, thief!
I mean, Ultrastar!
———————————————
Many thanks, good sir!
———————————————
I beg you... Never return...
———————————————
...Well, well, it's been an age, good
sir! But why such a disagreeable
visage? No thank you to THAT!
———————————————
So all you must endeavor to do is
Track down all the glowing orbs
And collect them all before time
Runs out!
———————————————
Heh... Rather outstanding name, I must say.
———————————————
Very well, good sir!
———————————————
For a limited time, the STAR game
will cost you a paltry 20 Rupees...
Care to play?
———————————————
It might be necessary for you to
arm both hands with those odd
devices you are using.
———————————————
Stop the show! Good sir! You're
not through yet...but you wish to
end the STAR game nonetheless?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
So all you must endeavor to do is
Track down all the glowing orbs
And collect them all before time
Runs out!
———————————————
Oh, what a misery-torn day this is!
You didn't care for it, good sir?
———————————————
If you wish to play, return anytime!
———————————————
Heh heh... Yes, MANY thanks.
———————————————
Oh, my STARS! Wherever did you
appear from, good sir?!
———————————————
Ah-CHOOOO!
———————————————
A thousand apologies, but would
you mind coming back later?
———————————————
Ah-CHOOOOOOOOO!
...Ugh.

———————————————
Goooo to the spot that you've
just seen...and do...something.
———————————————
Beast! Get out!
———————————————
Accepting donations!
———————————————
What?! You mean Queen Rutela?!
———————————————
Yes. She sacrificed her own life in
order to protect the residents of
Zora's Domain.
———————————————
Not only that, but the whole village
and those in it were frozen in ice.
———————————————
Frozen? Zora's Domain, frozen?
But it's such a warm climate...
———————————————
I don't know details yet... I plan on
investigating that next.
———————————————
Hey!
———————————————
Hey, you! Your shoes are grimy!
———————————————
I'll polish 'em for you for 10
Rupees.
———————————————
[.]OK!
[.]No need.
———————————————
Listen, you! With shoes that dirty,
you'll never make it to the top! 
———————————————
Hey! You! You need money to hit it
off with the ladies!
———————————————
Now that's what I'm talking about!
I'll polish 'em so well, they'll
shine!
———————————————
So? What do you think? Shiny, eh?
———————————————
If they get dirty again, I'll polish
'em up for you.
———————————————
Feels good to be wearing shoes as 
shiny as those, don't it?
———————————————
In crowded places like this, though,
you can't help but get 'em dirty.
———————————————
The elder told me to escort Telma,
but...
———————————————
This city air does not suit my
skin...
———————————————
Ugh...
———————————————
I cannot wait to return home and
soak in the hot spring...
———————————————
I heard that an acquaintance of
Telma's defeated the beast that
had been attacking tourists on the
bridge.
———————————————
Yes, you remember that young man
who came by here the other day?
His name was [Link]...
———————————————
You don't mean...the hero-type?
———————————————
Unbelievable... So that getup
wasn't just a costume...
———————————————
Well now, if that isn't a bit of a
shock! I was rather snotty to him,
if I recall...
———————————————
I suppose I should apologize when
I see him next... I'd hate for him to
resort to fisticuffs or some such!
———————————————
Well now, if that isn't a bit of a
shock! Perhaps I'll speak to him
next time...
———————————————
His name was [Link]... 
It sounds as though he brought
Telma and her young ward to
Kakariko Village.
———————————————
And here I was, thinking Hyrule was
empty of men of valor...
———————————————
Oh, no, I don't believe he's from
Hyrule proper at all.
———————————————
No, my understanding is that he's
from the small neighboring
province of Ordona.
———————————————
This may sound horribly elitist...but
people who do not know the city
simply do not know fear.
———————————————
That old codger Auru is at Lake
Hylia, studying the desert.
———————————————
Ashei mentioned Snowpeak
Mountain and headed off...
———————————————
I wonder if the Sacred Grove that 
Rusl mentioned is near this mark...
———————————————
Shad is in Kakariko Village now.
Would you check on the children if
you head that way, [Link]?

Plaaaaanning a reunion? A remote
bar is your luuuuucky spot.
———————————————
Waaaant to relieve some stress?
Take a hiiiint from the Zoras and
dive to the laaaaaake bottom.
———————————————
Ohhhhh... Something strange
wanders this waaaaay...
———————————————
A beast should aaaact like a beast.
Don't worry about huuuuumans...
Harbor the power of the aaanimals.
———————————————
Hmm... This wolf stinks of human...
———————————————
Baaaack to the forest with you...
———————————————
If you waaant the attention of
people in town, you must become
huuuman...
———————————————
The thing you seeeeek is buried in
sand. If you waaant it, fly to find it!
———————————————
The thing you seeeeek is buried in 
snow. The seeeecret to climbing
snowy peaks is a furrrr coat.
———————————————
The thing you seeeeeek was lost
long ago. Ask an aaaaaaged man
about things from the paaaaaast.
———————————————
The thing you seeeeeeek has flown 
to the sky. Perhaps you should
taaake that trip yourself?
———————————————
What?! What was that sound?!
———————————————
Perhaps you should make lots of
meeeemories as gifts for the
wooorld beyond this one.
———————————————
Flee not what is right befoooore
you! Hyrule Castle is just noooorth
of Castle Town!
———————————————
What did you thiiiiink...
———————————————
If you looose sight of your goal,
don't hesitate to stop by again...
———————————————
No matter how good your clothes
look, you don't look pulled 
together if your shoes are dirty.
———————————————
If someone's checking you out,
they'll look at your shoes too...
and secretly LAUGH at you!
———————————————
If someone's checking you out,
they'll look at your shoes too...
I bet they didn't let you in at
that snooty shop, did they?
———————————————
What do you think? I polish 'em up
real nice for 10 Rupees.
———————————————
...Oh, boy! I thought you were a
giant grasshopper!
———————————————
...Oh, boy! I thought you were a
giant jewel beetle!
———————————————
...Oh, boy! I thought you were a
giant scarab beetle!
———————————————
But you're not a bug! You're a
person! Still, you're wearing those
clothes, so that tells me you like
bugs too!
———————————————
Oh, boy, I forgot the formalities!
You have an audience with the
princess of the bug kingdom.
Agitha is my name!
———————————————
I've invited the 24 golden bugs of
the world to the ball, but...
———————————————
I don't know if they got lost on the 
way or what...but they're
not here, that's for sure.
———————————————
If you see them, would you please
bring them here to Agitha's Castle?
And tell them the princess awaits!
———————————————
Oh, boy, if you have a bug with you
now, please give it to me. The ball
must begin!
———————————————
I wonder if there's a partner for li'l
[insect] somewhere close by
where you found this one?
———————————————
Sniff sniff...
I sense it! The distinct pheromones
of golden bugs on you!
———————————————
That leaves one bug that's not in
attendance... The princess is irked
and soon will be peeved!
———————————————
If you find that last bug, no
lollygagging! Bring it here right
away, OK?
———————————————
Thanks to you, I have [var] in
attendance at the ball!
———————————————
[var] left until I have them all...
If you don't mind my asking, could
you find a partner for any single
bug at the ball?
———————————————
At the moment, I have [var] here at
Agitha's Castle, ready for the ball.
———————————————
I sent invitations to the ball to the
24 golden bugs, but still no one
has arrived...
———————————————
Oh, boy, am I happy! I'm
surrounded by bugs!

———————————————
Here, listen... Can you hear the
happy calls of the bugs?
———————————————
I know you have bugs...
———————————————
Have you brought a bug for
Princess Agitha's ball?
———————————————
Li'l beetle, li'l beetle, I want to use
that shiny shell as a pillow and
fall asleep...
———————————————
Li'l butterfly, li'l butterfly, I want
to be wrapped up in that powder,
too...
———————————————
Li'l stag beetle, li'l stag beetle,
your spiky pinchers are so sharp!
They must feel so good...
———————————————
Li'l grasshopper, li'l grasshopper,
I'd love to tickle your belly all day
long...
———————————————
Li'l phasmid, li'l phasmid, I want to
tie your long antennae into bows...
———————————————
Li'l pill bug, li'l pill bug, I wish I
was smaller so I could roll you
around like a ball...
———————————————
Li'l mantis, li'l mantis, if I had
sickles like that, I could slice
onions better...
———————————————
Li'l ladybug, li'l ladybug, if I was
smaller, I would get on your back
and we'd fly around...
———————————————
Li'l snail, li'l snail, just once I'd
like to take a bath in that slime...
———————————————
Li'l dragonfly, li'l dragonfly, when
you look at me with those great
big eyes, I...
———————————————
Li'l ant, li'l ant, I might mistake
you for a grain and put you in my
cereal...
———————————————
Li'l dayfly, li'l dayfly, I want to take
your colorful tail and make the
loveliest braid ever...
———————————————
Oh, boy, thank you so much!
I'm so happy!
———————————————
[var] left until I have them all...
Oh, I hope that you'll keep bringing
them here! You will, right?
———————————————
Allow me to share this happiness
with you!
———————————————
Oh, yes! We have a pair! Don't
those li'l bugs look happy?!
———————————————
As a symbol of my royal gratitude,
please accept this!
———————————————
Oh! This means all the bugs have
made it to the ball safely!
———————————————
Hee hee hee... And everyone has
a partner. They all look so happy...
———————————————
You worked very hard. Your efforts
will forever be passed down in the
insect kingdom, brave knight.
———————————————
Please accept this declaration of
honorable citizenship and the
memento that goes along with it.
———————————————
If you ever feel like talking to the
bugs again, you know where to go!
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
If you see them, please bring them
here to the ball at Agitha's Castle.
———————————————
Oh, oh, oh boy! Who's your friend?
You're a li'l [insect]! Aren't you,
you li'l cutie?!
———————————————
...You actually went bug hunting
for me, didn't you?
———————————————
To be honest, I doubted you
would... I guess some might
consider me a poor-mannered
princess...
———————————————
From now on, if you bring me
insects, I'll share my happiness
with you. You can keep it in this!
———————————————
If any bug becomes part of a pair,
I think I'll be able to share GREAT
happiness with you!
———————————————
Ho! I remember you, Brother!
———————————————
Thanks to you, we are now able to
open up shop again!
———————————————
I will give you a special price on
hot springwater. How is
20 Rupees?
———————————————
[.]Buy!
[.]No, thanks.
———————————————
Really? Well, next time you need
some, you know where to go,
Brother!
———————————————
Oh, wait! You know you cannot
carry hot springwater around with
you without an empty bottle.
———————————————
Wait! You do not have enough
money, Brother! I cannot bring the
price down any more...
———————————————
Got it, Brother! I will provide you
with some steaming hot water!
———————————————
I have a limited supply of hot 
springwater! The race goes to the
swift, as it is said!
———————————————
No pushing! If you want hot
springwater, form one line!
———————————————
Father is all better! He can work
again!
———————————————
Bathe in it to moisturize the skin!
Drink it to restore health! Famous
Goron hot springwater, THIS WAY!
———————————————
My father cannot get any hot
springwater to sell, so lately he
just sits outside the eastern gate.
———————————————
I talk to him but he just sighs...
He does not seem like the father I
remember!
———————————————
This is so bad! I am afraid my
father will never be the same! I do
not know what to do!
———————————————
I talk to him and all he does is
sigh... Please do something!
———————————————
If you need help, you should talk to
the village elder! I would go, but
my legs will not take me there...
———————————————
Jovani.
———————————————
Oh... Th-Thanks for beating the
ghost. Can I call you...doggie?
———————————————
I'm Jovani. I...became consumed by
greed long ago, and sold my soul
to a dark creature that did this to
me...
———————————————
I can't move... I can't go see my
girlfriend... My pet cat Gengle is 
frozen on my head... I don't think
I could be more miserable...
———————————————
I have to ask you a favor, doggie...
Can you find and defeat the 20
ghosts that lurk in the dark for me?
———————————————
I think if you can free the pieces of
my soul from the ghosts that hold
them, I'll be free...
———————————————
Oh, but it's raining out now, so I
don't think you can go outside
directly. I'll open the door to the
underground waterway for you...
———————————————
Once the rain stops, you can come
back in here by digging around the
front wall where the cats gather...
Understand, doggie?
———————————————
That treasure chest is connected to
the underground waterway... You
can get out from there.
———————————————
Once you've found and defeated
the 20 ghosts that lurk in the
darkness, come here by digging by
the wall where the cats gather...
———————————————
Doggie... Look... I still can't move.
———————————————
I NEED TO MOVE! Quick, you have
to bring me the remaining ghost
souls! I still need [var] more!
———————————————
You did it! I can move again! This is
all thanks to you, right?
———————————————
Oh, I have to thank you... Will this
do?
———————————————
But...my body is still golden...
Does this mean my soul is still not
whole?
———————————————
That's strange... Maybe we need
the souls of 60 ghosts...
———————————————
Can I ask another favor of you,
doggie? Can you defeat more
ghosts? Just [var] more...
———————————————
I can't see my girlfriend looking
like this...
———————————————
Doggie, please... Defeat just
[var] more!
———————————————
Ah ha ha ha! I hear you can get this
stuff in the cave on the western
edge of the Gerudo Desert, too!
———————————————
You did it! Look at me! I'm back to
my old self again!
———————————————
Thanks to you, everything in my life
is coming up roses! Ha ha HA!
———————————————
Oh, of course, I need to thank
you... Please accept this...
———————————————
All right! I need to let my girlfriend
know that I'm back!
———————————————
I wonder what her expression will
be when she sees I'm back?!
———————————————
H-Hey! Where did that ghost come
from?!
———————————————
H-Hey you! Don't just stand there! 
Get that ghost!
———————————————
Wahhh... Wah wahhh...
———————————————
I hadn't seen her in a while, and
she'd started dating another man...
———————————————
Wahhh... Ahh wahhhh... Ohh...
———————————————
Hey, doggie!
———————————————
Both Gengle and I can move now!
You did this for us, right?
———————————————
That's strange... Maybe you needed
60 ghost souls...
———————————————
...I feel bad asking, doggie, but you
think you could defeat more
ghosts? Just [var] more...
———————————————
Gengle can move now, too, and
something tells me you had quite a
bit to do with all of this!
———————————————
We both need to thank you, then!
Will this do?
———————————————
Say, I wonder where my owner
went...
———————————————
If you find him, will you tell me
where he might be?
———————————————
What? Come again if you run out of
money.
———————————————
Oh, it's you.
———————————————
I see... So my master got dumped,
huh?
———————————————
Well, I guess it goes to show that
for humans, it's all about money.
———————————————
I guess that means we don't need
any more money...so you can take
it all.
———————————————
Oh, you're back. Put your hand
out.
———————————————
Say, you're the one who fixed my 
master up, right? I owe you!
———————————————
My name's Gengle. I'm the leader
of the cats outside.
———————————————
Well, well... Now that I can move,
maybe I should go outside and 
breathe some fresh air...
———————————————
Thanks for all your help!
———————————————
All this money... What are we going
to do with it?
———————————————
Thanks for your help.
———————————————
Say, have you seen my master
around?
———————————————
You know... It'd be fine if he
wouldn't mope at the bar every
night since getting dumped.
———————————————
Hey, we haven't met before. You're
the one who saved me, right?
———————————————
You know, I've just got to thank
you!
———————————————
If you would...
———————————————
For the sake of peace in Hyrule...
Would you please make a donation?
———————————————
[.]30 Rupees
[.]50 Rupees
[.]Sorry...
———————————————
Those who believe in peace will
find it within themselves.
Believe me...
———————————————
Oh... Callous youth...
———————————————
Work before praying for peace...
———————————————
May the spirit of love descend
upon you...
———————————————
Your prayer has reached the
skies above.
———————————————
Take good care of your body, for it
was provided to you by forces you
cannot comprehend...
———————————————
If you continue to pray for peace, 
someday you will be surrounded
with love...
———————————————
Young man, I think you're CUTE! So
I'm rooting for you![heart]

———————————————
Hello, Heroic Brother! Nice to see
you again!
———————————————
I am here to peddle with my dad. 
He is out on the observation deck.
———————————————
Hey, Brother! [ 8C]One cup of lantern
oil is 30 Rupees ! What a bargain!
———————————————
Brother! [ 8C]One cup of lantern oil is
30 Rupees! You must buy it!
———————————————
What, you think it is expensive?
Well, that is crazy talk!
———————————————
I cannot sell you oil without an
empty bottle...
———————————————
You do not have enough Rupees...
I am a generous Goron, but I must
make a living!
———————————————
Thanks, Brother! When you need
oil, make sure you buy it from me!
———————————————
Hey, heroic brother!
———————————————
So, is the view from the
observation deck really nice?
———————————————
My dad is serious about business,
so he always says, "I must man the
store!" ...Which means he never
takes me out to the deck...
———————————————
But I want to be a good business
Goron like him, so maybe it is all
for the best...
———————————————
So, Brother, would you buy some
[ 8C]lantern oil from me for 30 Rupees?
———————————————
Brother.
———————————————
Just buy some [ 8C]lantern oil from me
for 30 Rupees, OK?
———————————————
Come back whenever you need
some. I must man the store no
matter what, so I will be here!
———————————————
You do not have enough Rupees...
You may be a brother to the
Gorons, but I cannot give it away
for free!
———————————————
Thanks, Brother!
———————————————
Still, I came all the way to Castle
Town, so I would like to see the
view from the deck...
———————————————
Ah! It is my heroic brother!
———————————————
My dad brought me back here for
the first time in a while.
———————————————
But things around here look a little
different from the last time...
———————————————
We were allowed through the inner
gate right away last time, but this
time we were not let through at all.
And without a reason, even...
———————————————
Oh, and Brother... I am selling
potions here now.
———————————————
You can buy [ 8C]one cup of red potion
for only 40 Rupees!
———————————————
Hey, Brother, do you have enough
red potion?
———————————————
Drink it up for lots of health,
Brother! I am talking about [ 8C]one cup
of red potion for 40 Rupees!
———————————————
I cannot sell you red potion
without an empty bottle, Brother...
Make sure you bring one next time.
———————————————
And if you want to know why the
prices are higher than in Kakariko,
it is what my dad calls "regional
pricing"! It is innovative!
———————————————
You do not have enough Rupees,
Brother...
———————————————
Thanks, Brother! Come back
anytime you need more!
———————————————
Oh, it is you? Thanks for that
business with the elder, Brother.
———————————————
Thanks to you, I am back here in
Castle Town, doing business again,
Brother!
———————————————
It has been a while, but I am glad
to see that the people and the
general vibe have not changed too
much.
———————————————
However... I cannot quite figure it,
but there is something a little
strange going on here that I
noticed...
———————————————
Do you not feel anything?
———————————————
So anyway, do you have enough
arrows, Brother?
———————————————
Would you like to buy [ 8C]30 arrows
for 40 Rupees?

———————————————
Unlike other Gorons, business
seems to be the only thing I am
good at, Brother.
———————————————
So how about [ 8C]30 arrows for 40
Rupees, Brother?
———————————————
I see... Well, if you decide you
need something, just come back
and make a purchase, Brother.
———————————————
Do not worry about it if you have a
bunch of arrows, Brother. Just
return when you need more!
———————————————
Sorry, Brother... But you do not
have enough Rupees.
———————————————
I will be right here, though, so you
can come back anytime.
———————————————
You...
———————————————
You can see it, correct? What has
happened to Hyrule Castle...
———————————————
That strange feeling I noticed when
we first arrived... Perhaps it was
this all along, Brother...
———————————————
I must tell you, I have kept this a 
secret from the others. Yes, it is a
secret to everybody.

I do not want to agitate the young
ones.
———————————————
Despite all that is going on, if you
think you need more arrows, just
let me know, Brother.
———————————————
So... Would you want to buy [ 8C]30
arrows for 40 Rupees?
———————————————
It is embarrassing that the only
thing I can do for you, our
benefactor, is sell you arrows.
———————————————
I insist you let me know if you
should ever need arrows, Brother.
———————————————
So... Would you want to buy [ 8C]30
arrows for 40 Rupees?
———————————————
I see... Got it. This is about all I
can do for you, Brother.


Come again if you need more...
———————————————
If you have enough, do not worry 
about it. You just let me know if
you need them, Brother.
———————————————
You do not... have enough Rupees, Brother...
———————————————
Sorry, Brother.



I am always here, so stop by if you
need them.
———————————————
Oh... You are the hero who saved
our elder, are you not? What an
honor to meet you again, Brother!
———————————————
Thanks to you, we were able to
come back here and resume
business!
———————————————
But having been gone for a while,
I have noticed a strange difference
in the air here...
———————————————
Anyway... Would you want a [ 8C]Hylian
shield for 210 Rupees?
———————————————
I cannot sell it for as low a price as
you might get in Kakariko Village,
but for you, I can still make it a
decent bargain, Brother.
———————————————
Would you want a[ 8C] Hylian shield for
210 Rupees?
———————————————
See, it is a little more expensive
here because of regional pricing
and all... That is the way of the
world, Brother.
———————————————
Oh, you need more Rupees. Go
save up a few and come back,
Brother.
———————————————
Thanks, Brother! I am sure you will
make fine use of that purchase!
———————————————
Oh... You are the hero who saved
our elder, are you not? What an
honor to meet you again, Brother!
———————————————
Thanks to you, we were able to
come back here and resume
business!
———————————————
But having been gone for a while,
I have noticed a strange difference
in the air here...
———————————————
I went to go get permission to do
business in the castle, but they
would not even let me in, so I just
set up shop here.
———————————————
We have some goods for you to
look at up top, too, so go take a
peek, Brother.
———————————————
We will be doing business here for
a while, Brother, so come take a
look anytime.
———————————————
Because of the crowd in the
southern street, all the kittens
can't get through... What's 
happening?
———————————————
You look so stern... With that look
on your face, you'll frighten the
humans!
———————————————
Jovani... Where'd he go, meow?
———————————————
I wonder what Gengle is up to in
the house... 
———————————————
The ground is soft from the rain, so
I wonder if you can dig your way
in under the wall, meow?
———————————————
Eek! That thing on your back...
Is it all right?
———————————————
The person in the tent on the
southwest street...makes me
suspicious, mrow.
———————————————
That Zora kid came through here
looking as bad as that. Why don't
you take this one to Telma's bar,
too?
———————————————
You should ask Telma at the bar 
about helping the creature on your
back...
———————————————
The circus tent on southwestern
street... It's a fraud... I'm almost
sure of it!
———————————————
We normally hold our meetings in
the open space in front of Jovani's
house, but...
———————————————
Don't you think that humans who
pick us up and carry us around are
annoying?!
———————————————
I don't see why, if Boss Gengle
isn't coming anyway, we can't have
the meeting in front of my house.
———————————————
Hmm... Human movement is so
rushed and disorganized.
———————————————
Maybe we should go to the central
plaza to perform reconnaissance...
———————————————
So this town finally got running
water, huh...
———————————————
It's really coming down... At this
rate, today's meeting will be
cancelled...
———————————————
Haaaaah... So sleepy...
———————————————
I hear voices coming from Jovani's 
room, but...I wonder if there's
something keeping him in there.
———————————————
Yeah, normally Jovani would be
leaping out of there.
———————————————
I'm also relieved that Gengle is 
doing well. 
———————————————
Ugh... I really want to take a bath...
———————————————
I'm bored... Maybe I'll take a bath
and call it a day...
———————————————
Haven't seen your face around here
before...
———————————————
If you want to know about this 
town, then you should ask Louise,
Telma's cat.
———————————————
Mr. Gengle can't come out today 
either...
———————————————
Apparently his master is more
important than I am!
———————————————
If you want to know about this
town, you should ask Louise at
Telma's.
———————————————
So Gengle is safe?! I'm so glad!
———————————————
Oh, hello. This is my first time
in this town...
———————————————
I'm looking for someone named
Louise. She's supposed to know
this town well. Where's the bar?
———————————————
It looks like there is no bar on this
street... Maybe I'll look somewhere
else. 
———————————————
Ribbit! Normally I live in the
underground passageway, but I
came out because of the good
weather.
———————————————
Have you ever been below this
town? It's really spacious!
———————————————
After all, the underground passage
was made so that the Hyrule
soldiers could escape. Ribbit!
———————————————
The underground passageway
stretches about town and is
very spacious! Ribbit!
———————————————
I just hate the rain... I can't get 
comfortable whether I sit or stand!
———————————————
Maybe my sixth sense is trying to
tell me something...
———————————————
Yeah... I just can't get comfortable
today...
———————————————


The door is locked...

HOT SPRINGWATER SOLD HERE
———————————————
You got some bread!
It's hot and fresh from the oven!
———————————————
...But it costs WAY too many
Rupees, so you should put it back.
———————————————
You got a pretty flower!
And the price is nice, too!
———————————————
...But there's no one manning the
shop, so you should put it back.
———————————————
You got a sweet-looking apple!
It looks just ready to eat, too!
———————————————
Hmm... Hold on. It looks like the
shop over there has some too, so
maybe you should compare to see
which ones are sweetest first.
———————————————
Hmm... Yes... The ones over there
are sweeter, so let's put this one
back.
———————————————
Aw, what an emotional reunion!
Yes, a girl and her wolf! Eee hee!
———————————————
Sorry, but you know how it goes!
These folks can't see you, either...
[sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Sell it!
———————————————
Sell it to ME!
———————————————
I'll take one! I'll take one! I don't
really want one, but I'll take one,
by gosh!
———————————————
Hey, wait a second! What's going
on with this water lately?
———————————————
I don't know why you're hassling
ME about this...
———————————————
The only reason for there to be a
water shortage here is if something
has happened at the town's water
source, Lake Hylia.
———————————————
If you already know what the
problem is, what are you still doing
here?
———————————————
W-Well, er, it MIGHT be the case,
but Lake Hylia is under the
jurisdiction of western Hyrule...
———————————————
Ugh! Good-for-nothing!
———————————————
So, when is this water going to be
back to normal, huh?!
———————————————
Look, if you want Lake Hylia
evaluated, you need to talk directly
to someone involved with the
western Hyrule department...
———————————————
Ugh! Good-for-nothing!
———————————————
Hey! Wait a sec! This water started
bubbling up all of a sudden!
What's going on?
———————————————
I... I was going to ask you the same
thing...
———————————————
Are you serious? YOU ARE A
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING!
———————————————
Hey, so, did you hear? They say
that a Zora child collapsed near
here!
———————————————
I thought Zoras were typically
found up north, right? I wonder
why one came down here.
———————————————
Well... I heard that he was taken
to the bar on the other side of
the southern road.
———————————————
The bar? You mean Telma's place?
Hmm... She's got it rough...
———————————————
The Zora child... I heard he was
taken to the bar on the other side
of the southern road...
———————————————
Hmm... Telma's always got her
hands full...
———————————————
The Zora child... I heard the doctor
on East Street gave up, so Telma
took him to another town.
———————————————
I heard...but that quack probably
didn't give the child a full exam
because he was a Zora.
———————————————
Oh! You're a new face. Have you
ever been in that shop?
———————————————
If not, you should really check it
out sometime!
———————————————
Oh yes, you definitely should!
———————————————
So, have you seen the merchandise
they carry at that store?
———————————————
If not, I'd love to show you
sometime!
———————————————
Yes, you should really let her show
you!
———————————————
That shop is SO pretentious. The
merchandise is REALLY pricey, and
the clients are REALLY snooty. 

———————————————
We were just saying how nice it
would be if shops like that got shut
down.
———————————————
Oh, by the way, I heard there's
some shop in Kakariko that has
really great deals!
———————————————
Oh, really? Wouldn't it be great if a
shop like that opened up around
here?
———————————————
Oh, I know, right?!
———————————————
Do you know Kakariko Village?
There's a shop there that has the 
BEST deals!
———————————————
I wish we had shops like that here,
instead of that fancy-pants
expensive one!
———————————————
Yeah, that'd be great!
———————————————
Is it true that Lake Hylia to the
west dried up?!
———————————————
I hadn't heard that there was a
drought in western Hyrule...
———————————————
What's going to happen to us if we
run out of hot springwater, too...
———————————————
O spirits of Lanayru, please deliver
merciful rain to Lake Hylia in the
west... Hrum mrum brum...
———————————————
So what the soldier by the spring
said, that was the truth!
———————————————
Before the water supply runs out, 
we must stock up on water, even 
hot springwater...
———————————————
Isn't this a ladies-first situation?!
———————————————
Is this the back of the line?
———————————————
What's going on here?!
———————————————
Buy it! You know you want it!
———————————————
If you want one, then get one!
———————————————
Buy one! Get one!
———————————————
If you want one, get one!
———————————————
There seems to be something going
on at the fountain...
———————————————
Phew... I'm gonna go put my feet
up at Telma's bar when I'm done
with work.
———————————————
Nobody can get into the castle...
Maybe we should tell them all to
disperse...
———————————————
What? If you need something, tell
the soldier over there.
———————————————
Say, have you ever been to Agitha's
place on this backstreet?
———————————————
If you take a bug to her... Oops!
I can't say anything else!
———————————————
The Fortune-Telling Mansion
     FANADI'S PALACE
———————————————
Play the STAR game that's all
the rage in Hyrule! Don't you
want to be a STAR, too?
———————————————
Hahhh... I'm so bored...
———————————————
East gate of Hyrule Castle...secure!
———————————————
A Goron passed through here
earlier. I wonder what he was
doing...
———————————————
The eastern bridge is closed, and 
there shouldn't be a way out, but...
———————————————
I wonder what the Goron beyond
here is doing...
———————————————
I've received orders from above
to investigate why we can't go to
the spirit's spring in Lake Hylia!
Got that?!
———————————————
We've had a ton of complaints from
citizens who can't send prayers to
the spring spirit of Lake Hylia.
———————————————
Go there! The location is the one I
showed you on the map earlier!
Got it?!
———————————————
What?! Study it and know it well!
———————————————
I told you! The citizens are upset
that they can't pray to the spring
spirit of Lake Hylia!
———————————————
The location is written right there
on that map on the table! Have
you figured it out yet?
———————————————
Study it well! And don't even
THINK about shirking your duty!
———————————————
Hey, have you been to the
fortune-teller's place on the
southern thoroughfare? She's
amazingly accurate!
———————————————
......
———————————————
All entry is strictly prohibited right
now! I must ask you to go back.
———————————————
Aww... How long do I have until
this shift is over...
———————————————
Ah, no, no, NO! We've been told
not to allow anyone in right now.
———————————————
Oh no... I wonder why the water's
out...
———————————————
It's great that we now have water
and everything, but I wonder what
caused the outage?
———————————————
Oh, sightseeing?  Or on business?
———————————————
This is a wonderful town. The
residents are friendly, too, so
please feel free to talk to them.
———————————————
This is one of the older shops in 
Castle Town, so most of our
customers are regulars...
———————————————
Though most of them are gossips...
———————————————
If this water outage continues, we
soon won't be able to relax with a
cup of tea...
———————————————
No tea... Such is life nowadays...
———————————————
Apparently, the reason for the
drought is that water is not flowing
from the upper stream...
———————————————
But, I still...don't feel refreshed...
———————————————
I don't feel refreshed...
———————————————
You know the fortune-teller's place
on the southern thoroughfare?
She's amazingly accurate!
———————————————
I hadn't had my fortune told until
just recently. I didn't believe in it,
but...

The other day, I had my love
fortune told...
———————————————
And right after that, I was able to
woo this young beauty!


Now, every day is glorious!
———————————————
Fortune will smile upon believers. 
You, too, should visit the fortune-
teller like she says.
———————————————
That's just so much fun!
———————————————
I know there's no water in town
right now, but...the more people
fret, the less it concerns me.
———————————————
It seems only the gossips are truly
worried... I wonder, is it better to
worry aloud, or to keep silent? 
People are interesting...
———————————————
Though water has been restored...
people still fret. And the more they
do, the less it concerns me.
———————————————
It seems the worriers are the
loudest... I wonder, are happier
people louder, or generally
quieter? People are interesting...
———————————————
The more I watch them every day,
the more interesting I find people 
are...
———————————————
The busier the person, the less
time he or she has to care about
others. In contrast, people with
more leisure time listen more.
Who knows which type of person
is better...
———————————————
People who have a lot of leisure
time make better, more sincere
listeners than those who are busily
scurrying about.
———————————————
The more relaxed a person is, the
nicer he or she becomes, that's
what I've found.

It's best not to overfill one's plate
with work or anything...
———————————————
Because of the water outage, they
can't take any drink orders...
———————————————
I think that's fine... You've been
drinking too much juice recently
anyway...
———————————————
Because the water's restored, they
can take orders now...
———————————————
Well, that's great...except you
never order anything anyway.
———————————————
Well, well, if it isn't the young 
swordsman. Are you vacationing
or here on business? This town is
famous for many things...
———————————————
Through the door on the side of
this cafe is the viewing platform.
Have you seen it already?
———————————————
The entrance to the viewing
platform is on the side of this cafe.
I heard that Gorons have been 
selling their wares there lately.
———————————————
If you want to get to the bar, use
the southern thoroughfare.
Swordsmen like yourself tend to
gather there.
———————————————
Go to the southern thoroughfare,
and if you get lost, ask someone
for directions.
———————————————
The fact that we can't take a bath
because of the water outage...
That's a big deal!
———————————————
I think it's fine. It's not like you
smell. It doesn't bother me.
———————————————
Well, maybe it doesn't bother YOU,
but YOU'RE the one who stinks!
———————————————
Taking baths with all the water we
want... To us, there is nothing
that brings more happiness.
———————————————
It's good. It smells good. Do I smell
good too?
———————————————
It smells like beasts...
———————————————
Hey! Kid! You look cool!
———————————————
Hey, don't you look good?! Are you
looking for something?
———————————————
I know! So you saw the new
attraction on the western
thoroughfare, right?
———————————————
Hey, buddy... Do you know what's
inside the tent that went up on the
western thoroughfare?
———————————————
When is that going on 'til? Is there
a show there or something?
———————————————
Have you gone already?
———————————————
The water level of Lake Hylia has
gone down, and you can't cross to
the spirit's cave.
———————————————
If the people who came to worship
from far away heard that, they'd
be very disappointed...
———————————————
It must be hard on Grandma, too, 
because she can't do her tours...
———————————————
Apparently the water is back, and
you can now cross to the cave of 
the spirit...
———————————————
But I'll bet that the folks coming
to worship will stay away for a
while...
———————————————
Those people who make a living off
of those coming to worship at the
lake must be struggling...
———————————————
I'm a tour guide here... Have you
already visited the cave of the
spirit?
———————————————
If you're here to sightsee, then
you sure came at the right time...
———————————————
Until a little while ago, there was
a bit of a problem and we couldn't
cross...
———————————————
If you've never been to the cave
of the spirit in Lake Hylia, you
REALLY should go.
———————————————
That cave was the home of the 
snake incarnation... A spirit that
protected the sacred place sunken
in Lake Hylia.
———————————————
It's only visible to the brave, so a
swordsman might be able to see it.
———————————————
I came here to buy hot springwater,
but the owner of the shop is out...
———————————————
The hot springwater at this shop is 
supposed to be good for the
health, so I came to get some for
my child... What am I going to do?
———————————————
This is the only shop that has hot
springwater. I wonder when they'll
sell it to us?
———————————————
Are you here to buy some hot
springwater? Do you have an empty
bottle to carry it in?
———————————————
I'm so foolish... I forgot an empty
bottle. Maybe I'll go buy some
container so I can get some for
my child...
———————————————
At this shop, as long as you have a
bottle, they'll sell you what goes in
it. So it's environmentally friendly! 
That's why we always come here.
———————————————
Hey, welcome!
———————————————
Or rather... You don't look like you
came here to buy meat, now do
you, swordsman?
———————————————
Might you be looking for the bar? 
It's right there at the bottom 
of the stairs behind you.
———————————————
We see a lot of swordsmen like
you around here.
———————————————
The bar is at the bottom of the
stairs behind you. The owner is
always very nice to me!
———————————————
Wow... The fortunes in this place
really are accurate!
———————————————
My fortune said that if I stand in 
front of the shop, a man wanting to
date me would come talk to me.
———————————————
That's what you're doing, right?
Sorry, but you're not my type.
———————————————
The fortunes from this place are so
spot-on, it's scary.
———————————————
You know, it said that even if I 
rebuff him, once a man is
captivated by me, he'll keep
approaching me.
———————————————
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in
younger men...
———————————————
I heard a boy passed out!
———————————————
When? Where?
———————————————
I dunno...
———————————————
A boy passed out and they took
him to a shop.
———————————————
Why? Where? They didn't take him
to the hospital?
———————————————
I dunno...
———————————————
Hey, you! Swordsman kid! Do you
know anything about the kid who
passed out?
———————————————
He keeps saying that they didn't
take him to the hospital, but to 
a shop!
———————————————
But that's what I heard!
———————————————
Hey! Swordsman! Did you see the
sick kid at any of the shops?
———————————————
But why would they take him to a
shop when he's sick...
———————————————
I'm not lying! That's what I heard!
———————————————
Swordsman kid, do you know this
song?
———————————————
Jovani... Jovani... Idiotic troll...
Blinded by his greed, the imps
took his soul...
———————————————
And even today, somewhere he
stays, though he's a grown-up...
Wah! Sniff! He moans...UH!
———————————————
So, you wanna hear it again?
———————————————
Do you have a second? Do you
know a guy named Jovani?
———————————————
My girl here put out a missing-
persons report on him. I think
she's just trying to make me
jealous.
———————————————
Strange things are happening...and
some people are even saying it's
the work of evil ghouls...
———————————————
It's kind of become an urban
legend, in a way...
———————————————
If you ever meet a man called
Jovani, tell him to get in touch
with this girl here...
———————————————
His cat's gone missing, too, so I'll
bet that cat is with him.
———————————————
Listen up! We were looking around
for the missing man, thinking his
disappearance was related to an
incident, but...
———————————————
Word came in that he's at the bar...
———————————————
Ugh, what a nuisance...
———————————————
Really, what a troublemaker...
Don't you get involved with a man
like that.
———————————————
Oh, what's this?
———————————————
Might you be looking for the bar,
too?
———————————————
Well, if you already know, then
fine! I get asked quite often where
it is...
———————————————
You're looking for the young
woman who recently started there,
aren't you? The bar's at the base
of the stairs.
———————————————
What? On this street, the only
place for swordsmen like you is the
bar.
———————————————
The bar is at the bottom of the
steps.
———————————————
Aren't you... Didn't you save the
Zora child?
———————————————
I'm right, aren't I? It's you, isn't
it? Am I mistaken?
———————————————
I know I'm right! I know these
things!
———————————————
But you're so young! I'm very
impressed...
———————————————
Hey, swordsman, are you looking
for something?
———————————————
If you're looking for the bar, I'd
recommend against it... Sounds like
something's going on...
———————————————
Sounds like something's going on
in the bar...
———————————————
Everyone was up in arms...
———————————————
Hey, swordsman, where to today?
———————————————
I know, you know? I've heard.
People were talking about you and 
what you've done...
———————————————
That Zora boy, how's he doing?
———————————————
Oh, welcome!
———————————————
Are you from out of town?
Me too.
———————————————
I've always been fascinated with 
castle towns. That's what brought
me here. It's been one culture
shock after another.
———————————————
Unlike the country, people are so 
busy... They won't stop for you
even if you call to them!
———————————————
City folk seem so anxious... It kind
of perplexed me at first, but...there
are secrets to city living.
———————————————
If there's anything you need, ask
people who have nothing to do.
They're normally happy to help.
———————————————
Say, what would you say you're 
good at?
———————————————
I'm good at...picking stuff up!
———————————————
Really, I'd rather be playing in a
meadow...but my master doesn't
understand.
———————————————
Really, I'd rather be playing in a
meadow...but my master doesn't
understand.
———————————————
Let's play sometime!
———————————————
Say...what do you like?
———————————————
I like...picking stuff up!
———————————————
But I hate stone pavement because 
it makes my paws hurt! No one
understands that!
———————————————
I like...to pick things up!
———————————————
But I don't like stone pavement
because it makes my feet hurt...
———————————————
Do you like dogs? They're cute,
huh?
———————————————
If you throw a bone or something, 
they'll bring it back, you know?
———————————————
You should play with one if you
have some free time.
———————————————
If you throw a bone or something, 
they wag their tails so happily...
———————————————
Dogs are so cute...
———————————————
What? What's up with you?
———————————————
You have some business at Agitha's
Castle?
———————————————
You don't look like you'd be a
friend of hers...
———————————————
I've got a piece of advice for you...
———————————————
If you don't have any business
here, you're better off not loitering
for very long.
———————————————
What... What business do you...
h-have with Agitha?
———————————————
You don't look like you'd have the
same interests as Agitha...
———————————————
You listening? I'm only going to say
this once.
———————————————
If you don't like bugs, then you're
better off not hassling her.
———————————————
You listening? I'm only going to
give you this advice one more
time...
———————————————
If you don't like bugs, then you're
better off not hassling her.
———————————————
What?
———————————————
If you want to go to the western
thoroughfare, just keep going
straight down the back road.
———————————————
If you head out on this path, you'll 
be in Hyrule Field, but I don't know
if the road goes all the way
through...
———————————————
Go through the back road to the
western thoroughfare.
———————————————
This is the way out to Hyrule Field.
...Though I don't know if you can
go through right now.
———————————————
Got all that?
———————————————
Oh, what is it?
———————————————
I just recently got transferred to 
this shop, so I'm not very familiar
with this area.
———————————————
Maybe you should ask the people
around here?
———————————————
I'm so sorry...
———————————————
I'm sorry, but I'm not very familiar 
with this area...
———————————————
I'm terribly sorry...
———————————————
Well, I don't think we've seen this 
swordsman before...
———————————————
There's only one shop in the
central plaza that sells items for
swordsmen.
———————————————
...But everything there is so
expensive that only wealthy 
people can shop there.
———————————————
There are items that a swordsman
might need at the shop in the
central plaza...but it's expensive...
———————————————
If you've never been there, you
should check it out.
———————————————
But that shop is really picky about
its clientele. Especially about how 
clean their shoes are...
———————————————
Ah, a swordsman, huh?
———————————————
Perfect timing. Have you ever been
to the large shop in the central
plaza?
———————————————
Swordsmen can get all kinds of
items for dirt cheap.
———————————————
Why don't you go check out the
huge shop in the central plaza?
———————————————
They've got a lot of items for
swordsmen.
———————————————
The super-cute boy is the
landmark!
———————————————
Haven't seen this swordsman
before... Is something going on?
———————————————
Well... It seems like a lot of strange
things are happening lately...
———————————————
Though the townsfolk don't show 
it, on the inside, they're all pretty
scared.
———————————————
Though the soldiers look calm and
go about their daily routine...
———————————————
Rumor has it that not even soldiers
can go deep inside Hyrule Castle...
———————————————
Might you be the swordsman who
tried to rescue the Zora child?
———————————————
You are, aren't you? No one will
say anything...but you're the talk of
the town.
———————————————
There's been nothing but scary
rumors lately, so your actions 
have given everyone hope.
———————————————
You're far more reliable than the 
incompetent Hyrulian soldiers.


———————————————
I can't explain it but...Castle Town
has changed.
———————————————
The soldiers and the residents are
all uneasy...
———————————————
And on top of that, we haven't
seen Princess Zelda, who is such a
supporter of the people.
———————————————
Do you know something?
———————————————
I wonder what that guy's doing?
He's looking right over here...
———————————————
Look. That guy standing directly
across from us.
———————————————
See? He's staring right at us!
———————————————
Look. That guy standing at a
straight shot down this street...
He's looking over here and 
saying something... I wonder what?
———————————————
He's looking over here. I wonder
what his story is?
———————————————
The man standing directly across
from us...
———————————————
See? He's looking right at us.
———————————————
The man standing directly across
from us... I wonder what he's
saying? And why is he looking
straight over here?
———————————————
Oh, what is it?
———————————————
Are you looking for a doctor or
something?
———————————————
The only thing on this street is a
doctor's office. See, there.
Immediately before you get to the
outer gate.
———————————————
If you're looking for a doctor's
office, it's there, just before the
gate.
———————————————
Yeah, see the soldier standing
there?
———————————————
I wouldn't recommend that fellow,
though...
———————————————
Oh, you need something?
———————————————
If you're looking for something a
swordsman might use, you should
check the central square, OK?
———————————————
Yeah, I think there was a Goron
on the observation deck that was
selling something a swordsman
could use.
———————————————
He came here selling his wares
often in the past, but I hadn't
seen him until recently...
———————————————
If you're looking for something a
swordsman might use, you should
check the deck in the square.
———————————————
The entrance to the deck is next
to the cafe. If you can't find it,
why don't you just try asking
someone in the area?
———————————————
Now, you seem like you can handle
yourself pretty well, but do you
know what's been going on around
here lately?
———————————————
It's just that... There are rumors
that recent dire events are being
caused by a curse from the people
who were driven from this land...
———————————————
You know, if you came here looking
to become a soldier, but you've
changed your mind now, I won't
say a thing to anyone...
———————————————
Hyrule was always known as a
sacred land in the past, and even
now it's protected by the royal
family and other spiritual figures...
———————————————
But there was a time when Hyrule
was torn by conflicts that swept
the land...
———————————————
And these recent disturbing events
may be caused by the leftover
anger and misery of the souls who
departed in that conflict...
———————————————
Try pressing [Z]! You should know
how to do this!
———————————————
Right, that's the way. If you need
help, just call me with [+^].
———————————————
Hey! Have you tried pressing [Z]?
This is no time to be lazy!
———————————————
When I see a spot to jump to, I'll
tell you, so make sure you respond
quickly by pressing [+^]!
———————————————
I'll guide you to sure footing, so
target me with [Z] and follow me
with [A]!
———————————————
You're a beast! You should know
what to do! Use your senses with
[+v] and poke around...
———————————————
By the way... Are you honing your
senses with [+v] like you should?
———————————————
There are lots of other spirits
roaming about here, you know.
Hone your senses with [+v] to see
them. They might know things...
———————————————
If you think I'm lying, why don't
you check it out? Hone your fine
senses with [+v]...[sfx] Eee hee!
———————————————
Hurry up and stand next to the
chain and press [Z]!
———————————————
Actually, there's one more of us,
but there's been a disturbing turn
of events in the eastern desert, so
he's gone to check it out.
———————————————
He's out checking the eastern
desert of Hyrule.
———————————————
Would you like me to show you
something? [<][+]
———————————————
Excuse me... Can I help you?
[<][+]
———————————————
Buy it now, if you're smart! Make
your selection using [<][+]!
———————————————
Buy it now, if you're smart!
Pick and choose using [<][+]!
———————————————
My dad can't get any hot
springwater to sell, so lately he
just sits outside the western gate.
———————————————
Ah ha ha ha! I hear you can get this
stuff in the cave on the eastern
edge of the Gerudo Desert, too!
———————————————
The person in the tent on the
southeast street...makes me
suspicious, meow.
———————————————
The circus house on the
southeastern street... It's a fraud!
I'm sure of it!
———————————————
W-Well, er, it MIGHT be the case,
but Lake Hylia is under the
jurisdiction of eastern Hyrule...
———————————————
Look, if you want Lake Hylia
evaluated, you need to talk directly
to someone involved with the
eastern Hyrule department...
———————————————
The Zora child... I heard the doctor
on West Street gave up, so Telma 
took him to another town.
———————————————
Is it true that Lake Hylia to the east
dried up?!
———————————————
I hadn't heard that there was a
drought in eastern Hyrule...
———————————————
O spirits of Lanayru, please deliver
merciful rain to Lake Hylia in the
east... Hrum mrum brum...
———————————————
West gate of Hyrule Castle...
secure!
———————————————
The western bridge is closed, and 
there shouldn't be a way out, but...
———————————————
I got it! You're here to see the new
attraction that just went up on the
eastern thoroughfare, aren't you?
———————————————
Hey, buddy... Do you know what's
in the tent that went up on the
eastern thoroughfare?
———————————————
If you want to go to the eastern
thoroughfare, just keep going
straight down the back road.
———————————————
Go through the back road to the
eastern thoroughfare.
———————————————
DAT1
———————————————
÷ 
———————————————
Eee hee hee! Well done!
———————————————
That's...what I was looking for.
———————————————
That's a Fused Shadow.
———————————————
It's what the light spirit called
dark power...
———————————————
Do you remember what that spirit
said? About how you had to match
the power of the king of shadows?
———————————————
Could it really be so easy? Is this
all there is to it? [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
There's a total of three Fused
Shadows. I think the other light
spirits have the rest...
———————————————
If you want to know exactly what
Fused Shadows are... Well, maybe
I'll tell you if you find the other
two.
———————————————
I guess you'd better do your best
to find them, huh? [sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
So let's not waste any more time
here when we could be looking
for the other two...
———————————————
I'll get you out of here... You pick
up the Heart Container that fell out
of that thing.
———————————————
Phew! Out at last!
———————————————
OUT! I'm finally out of there!
———————————————
Gracious... Once I got in there,
I couldn't squeeze back out!
———————————————
You were a big help... Thanks!
———————————————
I've been looking for something in
here, you see. Gracious, yes!
———————————————
You must need something here,
too. Shall we try working together
for a while, fellow adventurer?
———————————————
You may not think I look like much,
but I can be quite helpful!
———————————————
I can even warp you out of here
if you want to leave!
———————————————
So don't think of me as a burden!
Now let's get started!
———————————————
You see, I'm, erm... I'm an
adventurer too. I'm looking for
something...
———————————————
Oh, well then. Goodness. Goodness
gracious me. I suppose our paths
are destined to cross many times...
———————————————
You know, I'm of the mind that
everything happens for a reason.
And I'm also of the mind that I've
made up my mind!
———————————————
I'm going with you!
———————————————
I can do a lot of nice things for
you, so don't just think of me as
some burden now! Goodness, no!
———————————————
Ooh! Did you want to leave? I can
warp you right out!
———————————————
You can return right here, so there
are no worries!
———————————————
[.]Warp out!
[.]I'll stay.
———————————————
Oh, goodness... Aren't you a
trooper!
———————————————
Well, don't push it too hard. If you
need a breath of fresh, outside air,
just give me a holler!
———————————————
Yes, yes! Now... Leave it to me!
———————————————
Let me introduce you! This is
Ooccoo Jr.!
———————————————
Anytime you want to warp back to
this spot from outside, ask him.
———————————————
Now, bon voyage, you two!
———————————————
If you want to meet me at the
entrance rather than warping here,
just go there and I'll meet you!
———————————————
Ooccoo will be waiting right here,
so if you want to come back, just
tell Ooccoo Jr. using [Y] or [X].
———————————————
Well, then, boys, off you go!
———————————————
Oh, goodness! You say you want to
go outside?
———————————————
Me! Me! I wanna go too! I wanna go
too!
———————————————
Well then, I'll be waiting right here.
Off with you!
———————————————
Well, well! Welcome back!
———————————————
Without further ado, we're off!
———————————————
Hello there! You want to return to
the shop?
———————————————
[.]Return to shop
[.]Stay
———————————————
Oh, really? Well, if you feel like you
want to head back, just let me
know anytime, OK?
———————————————
I am the Fairy of Winds who resides
in this boomerang.
———————————————
You have freed me from evil, and
I now have my true power back.
———————————————
Please... Take it with you, use it to
aid your quest, and may both my
power and my blessing go with you.
———————————————
If you focus power in your
boomerang before releasing it, it
will unleash the power of wind,
aiding you in unforeseen ways.
———————————————
Hey! That's the monkey that stole 
your lantern!
———————————————
Doesn't it look like she's
beckoning you? Aren't you the
popular one?[sfx] Eee hee!
———————————————
Our work here is done. Let's go!
———————————————
It's so dark and dreary in here...
———————————————
Don't go running out of lantern oil
just when you need it most! I don't
want to take care of a lost little boy
who's afraid of the dark!
———————————————
Well, if it isn't HER again...
Looks like she's inviting you!
———————————————
What's was that all about? Are
these monkeys not getting along?
———————————————
That big ape looked pretty out of
sorts... You don't suppose that
thing's come down with a nasty
little bug or something, do you?
———————————————
I don't really understand this
monkey...but I guess we ought to
at least try following her!
———————————————
Well, let's look for more monkeys
and try to think of a way to help
them all out!
———————————————
What's her problem... Is she
trying to find her friends?
———————————————
Psssh! I guess I don't have
much of a choice but to accompany
you around here...but you'd better
thank me later!
———————————————
I bet even the monkeys should be
satisfied now.
———————————————
OK, let's continue combing this
place. We already found something
good, so let's keep searching
places we haven't looked yet.
———————————————
Well, I guess there are still some
monkeys you haven't freed yet!
———————————————
At this point, you should just save
them all and see what you can get
for it!
———————————————
If there are still some captured 
monkeys, shouldn't you help them 
all while you're at it?
———————————————
Once you've saved them all, we'll
see what you get for your troubles!
———————————————
What are you doing?
———————————————
Can't you use that lantern you have
to set stuff on fire?
———————————————
Hey, check those out!
———————————————
Did you take a look around? Notice
all the torches?
———————————————
Can't that boomerang you picked
up call up some wind?
———————————————
If you see something that you think
you can move with wind, you
should try throwing your
boomerang.
———————————————
Look for something that you can
move with wind!
———————————————
A door that opens with a windmill...
What are they trying to hide with 
this sophisticated contraption...
———————————————
You think you can open something
like this just by turning those?
———————————————
Based on this setup, there's got to
be an amazing treasure hidden
in there.
———————————————
Why don't you look around and see
if there's some sort of clue as to
how to open it!
———————————————
Well, if it isn't something useful.
———————————————
As long as you have that, you 
should be able to find where the 
captured monkeys are, right?
———————————————
Well, if it isn't something useful!
———————————————
With that, you might be able to
find what you're looking for...
Hurry up! Check your map!
———————————————
What's going on?! That boulder is 
going to make getting through here
pretty tough!
———————————————
Can't you break it somehow?
———————————————
Well, then, why don't you go look
for something that can break that
boulder!
———————————————
Hurry up and do something about 
that boulder... What if you used the
boomerang and one of those bomb
bugs?
———————————————
If you're not sure, you should 
carefully read how to use the
boomerang!
———————————————
Based on his size, he looks like the
boss monkey...but those other
ones were friendly. He looks pretty
hostile!
———————————————
We're on a very important mission
here, so knock down anything 
that gets in your way!
———————————————
Hey! If you have time to talk, hurry
up and take that guy down!
———————————————
That guy's dancing at the top of 
that pillar! I think he's making fun
of you!
———————————————
While that fool is up there dancing,
that's your chance to take him
down...
———————————————
You still don't get it? When that
guy's at the top of a pillar, shake it
to knock him down!
———————————————
To think that there was a monster
lurking deep inside the temple...
———————————————
Those things will gobble up a little
guy like you in one bite! If you
don't want that to happen, you'd
better keep your guard up!
———————————————
Those things look like idiots with 
their mouths open like that...
———————————————
Put something in those things'
mouths to shut them up!
———————————————
Eee hee! One more!
———————————————
It...didn't like that...
———————————————
I don't think it will be as easy this
time around. Don't get eaten!
———————————————
Hey, that guy... Isn't that the
boss monkey?!
———————————————
He brought an exploding bug!
Maybe he's trying to help?
———————————————
Hey! Take that bug the monkey's
holding and hit that thing in the
head! Hurry or it'll snack on you!
———————————————
I think we have a chance...
———————————————
That monkey's a good guy! Use his
help and destroy this thing!
———————————————
If you want to know about this
place, you might be better off
asking a monkey, not me.
———————————————
Hey... She doesn't speak because
you're a human! How
inconvenient...[sfx] Eee hee!
———————————————
I was wondering why she was being
so nice. Now I know that she just 
wanted you to help her friends...
———————————————
I don't like it, but we need her help
too, so I guess we have to...
———————————————
Hey! Forget about the monkey!
Help me find what I'm looking for!
———————————————
Well, that annoying monkey isn't
here anymore, so let's take our
time poking around the temple.
———————————————
I guess in order for us to check the
temple out completely, we need the
help of the monkeys.
———————————————
Ah well... Let's help the rest of
them!
———————————————
Now all we have to do is find what
we're looking for. Hurry!
———————————————
Look at all the torches... Is this
some kind of altar?
———————————————
Wait, why am I asking you? How
would you know? [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Hmm... What are you doing, turning
the lights on?
———————————————
You might as well light them all
and make this place really bright!
———————————————
Oh! What's going on?! Has there
been a monkey fight?!
———————————————
Oh no! Now we can't go any 
farther. We might as well go back.
———————————————
I don't know what's going on, but 
it seems like she wants to take you
somewhere, so maybe you should
just follow her.
———————————————
Whoa... Human?!
———————————————
What business does a human have
coming here?! None! No business!
———————————————
This is a forbidden place! I will
protect this treasure from you!
———————————————
Ugh... That...hurt a lot. Who knew
that humans were capable of such
feats of strength...
———————————————
...Uh... Maybe...you are...going to
see the patriarch of our tribe?
———————————————
...Ah! So THAT is why you are here!
In that case, take the weapon of
the Hero of the past...
———————————————
But in exchange, you must save the
patriarch of our tribe!
———————————————
With skills like yours, even the
patriarch can be brought back to
his senses...
———————————————
Take the Hero's weapon and save
our patriarch!
———————————————
Eee hee hee! Well done!
———————————————
Now we have two Fused Shadows...
———————————————
Hmm... You know, you've been very
helpful so far, so as a reward, I'll 
tell you an interesting story.
———————————————
Zant.
———————————————
That's the name of the King of
Darkness who cast this pall of
shadows over your world.
———————————————
He's very strong. You would be
nothing to him in your current
state...
———————————————
But Zant will never be my king!
I have nothing but scorn for his
supposed strength. Not that your
Zelda is much better... 
———————————————
It still appalls me that this world of
light is controlled by that princess.
A carefree youth, a life of luxury...
How does that teach duty?
———————————————
...But I guess I shouldn't begrudge
her the circumstances of her life.
She didn't choose it, after all. And
I would never wish harm on her...
———————————————
No, as long as I can get my hands
on the Fused Shadows, I'll be just
fine.
———————————————
Well, just one more left... Shall we?
[sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
Unngh... Urrgh...
———————————————
...Hmm? What am I doing here?
———————————————
Unngh... My head, it aches...
———————————————
Urrrgh... So much pain... I cannot
remember anything...
———————————————
Ah...
———————————————
I thought I felt a presence...but
what a surprise to find a young
human...
———————————————
Word has come to me of you...and
if Gor Coron has faith in you, then
your heart must be true.
———————————————
...I am one of the four Goron
elders. Gor Amoto is my name.
———————————————
You are heroic, young human.
Please, you must lend this tribe
your power.
———————————————
That is one of the key shards that,
when merged together, form the
key to the room where Darbus is
being held. He is our patriarch.
———————————————
The key is split into three pieces. 
Each of us elders keeps a piece.
———————————————
You must hurry to the other elders!
———————————————
The other two elders are at altars
in the mine. They are praying...
———————————————
Collect all three key shards and
save our tribe's patriarch! He
suffers under the power of evil...
———————————————
Oh... Ah... The young human. I am
pleased to see you make it this
far, Brudda...
———————————————
I am one of the four elders of the
Goron tribe. I am called Gor Ebizo.
———————————————
You have heard of the plight of our
patriarch. Otherwise you would not
have come to see me.
———————————————
Here, take this, Brudda...
———————————————
Now... There is one more shard,
but seeing you has reminded me of
the dangers that line the path to
it...
———————————————
There is something that may help
you... A weapon said to have been
left in this mine by a hero of old.
———————————————
It is beyond price, and so we have
protected it through generations...
———————————————
Now, when our tribe balances on
the brink of ruin, it could aid in our
salvation.
———————————————
The Hero's weapon is stored safely
up ahead...
———————————————
Talk to the guard and take it with
you, with the blessing of the
Gorons.
———————————————
There are limits to what we elders
can do to contain Darbus now that
he has been overcome by evil...
———————————————
You must aid us, Brudda. Please,
take the Hero's weapon and head
deeper as quickly as possible.
———————————————
Ah! You are here at last!
———————————————
I heard that you might pay a visit,
young human. I am farsighted in all
things.
———————————————
Here you go...the last key shard!
Combine all three shards!
———————————————
If you use that key, you can open
the room where Darbus, the tribal
patriarch, is being held.
———————————————
Who knows how powerful Darbus is
in his new grotesque form...
———————————————
But I suppose I should trust your
power, considering you came this
far...
———————————————
Hurry, now! To the patriarch's
room!
———————————————
The Hero's weapon you claimed...
———————————————
That weapon is said to have
defeated the most powerful evils
this world has ever known. It might
even work to calm Darbus...
———————————————
You are probably not used to it, so
before going any further, you
should work with it a little.
———————————————
Wait a minute... Come over here...
———————————————
I heard that the tribal patriarch has
been rescued...
———————————————
So... You kept your promise to us...
———————————————
Thank you, little human.
———————————————
I am glad we gave you the Hero's 
weapon.
———————————————
But...my job was to protect it. And
now that it is gone, I am very, very
bored.
———————————————
Phew! Free at last!
———————————————
Gracious... You're that nice fellow
who helped me out the other day!
How nice to see you again!
———————————————
Well, now that we've found each
other again, let's stick together for
a bit, hmm?
———————————————
I'll be right with you, so if you want
to warp out, just let me know!
———————————————
Goodness, gracious me! I'm so
happy we're meeting again!
———————————————
Ooh! Let's play! Let's play!
———————————————
Goodness! My my, settle down,
Son... Have you taken a liking to
this young man? Yes, you HAVE!
———————————————
Why, just look at how fond he is of
you! I can't break his heart, so
we'd better tag along with you.
———————————————
Erm... I see you've woken up!
———————————————
Goodness me... You know, I believe
I mentioned this in my letter, but
this fine young boy is my son.
———————————————
My son is clearly fond of you, so
do you mind if we join you again?
———————————————
Goodness, by all means! If you ever
want to go outside, just call me
using [Y] or [X]!
———————————————
The treasure that the spirit
entrusted to the Gorons... This
has to be it!
———————————————
Now, find the second Fused
Shadow!
———————————————
Is this a mine or a volcano? You
mean to tell me the Gorons come
in and out of this place like it's
no big deal?
———————————————
You're just a measly human! If you
fall into that lava, that's the end
of it, so be careful!
———————————————
To get the object I'm after, we're
going to need to collect all the key
shards the Goron elders have.
———————————————
We have to hurry and find the other
two!
———————————————
There's still one Goron elder with
a key shard... We have to get it as
quickly as possible!
———————————————
Yes! We collected all the key
shards! Let's hurry to the room the
Goron elders sealed off!
———————————————
Hey! How exactly do you plan to
fight the monsters in here without
a shield?
———————————————
You perishing in a place like this
isn't going to do me any favors, so
why don't you equip yourself
properly before you regret it.
———————————————
Aw, great... Looks like our path is
blocked again...
———————————————
Can't you be a little more...timely?
Figure out the timing for when
those flame pillars retract. That's
when you make your move!
———————————————
If you can't go up, why don't you
take a look around and see if you
can't go down?
———————————————
Can't you do anything to make
yourself sink? All you have to do is
put on a little extra weight.
———————————————
Looks like this guy is the guard...
Sounds like he's mistaken you for
an intruder, and I doubt he'll listen
to reason. You'll have to fight him.
———————————————
Whoa! Look at how the floor tilts!
Talk about unstable. You'd better
stick yourself to it so you don't
fall off!
———————————————
Don't be fooled by his size! He's
like the ones on the mountain
path: a Goron who can't really do
anything but roll!
———————————————
Wow! He's a tenacious guy...
He's lucky he's a Goron. Otherwise
he wouldn't be getting back up
here after falling into the lava!
———————————————
Just keep tossing him into the lava
until he quits getting back up!
———————————————
The fact that it could change a
Goron into a beast like this proves
that the power was forbidden for a
reason...
———————————————
Can't you use those chains around
his ankle to stop him from moving
around?
———————————————
He's all out of sorts! Now's your
chance!
———————————————
Look at the ground! Doesn't it look
like the rocks you stuck to on your
way here?
———————————————
If your feet keep slipping, why
don't you try to stick them to
the ground?
———————————————
As soon as he collapses, you've
got to go for his crystal eye!
———————————————
Now's the time to show off your
sword skills!
———————————————
Defeating something that big and
burly isn't going to be easy.
———————————————
There you go! Keep doing that and
then keep attacking that eye on his
forehead!
———————————————
That shining eye on his forehead is
releasing some powerful magic.
I bet if you shoot it with your bow,
you might be able to weaken him!
———————————————
That's weird. This place is pretty
cool. Good place to take a bath?
———————————————
Oh... It's one of the Gorons. Think
he's one of the elders that guy was
talking about?
———————————————
Well, if it isn't another decrepit
Goron. Must be another of their
so-called elders, huh?
———————————————
Well, looks like you made out all
right by coming here. You get to
keep some treasure of the ancient
hero!
———————————————
We've come all this way, so why not
take it? It might even make you
seem a little more heroic...
Eee hee hee!
———————————————
So this is where he was waiting,
huh? Well, let's get that last key.
———————————————
Hey! Did you see his forehead? I'm
sensing some powerful magic
coming out of that shining spot
on his forehead...
———————————————
These stupid Gorons... Every last
one of them just comes rolling right
at you!
———————————————
This floor is totally unstable! See
how it tilts? Don't get knocked off!
———————————————
Can't you just use the blue rock
surface like you have been?
———————————————
Are you listening? It won't be easy
from here on out. Press [B] to use
your sword and [Y] or [X] to use your
items to help move you along!
———————————————
You got that, right?
———————————————
Oh, and if there's anything else you
need help with, you can ask little
old me for some advice by pressing
[Z], OK?
———————————————
Ugh, too many enemies to count...
Deal with the ones nearby with
your sword by pressing [B]. Press [Y]
or [X] to use your bow on the rest.
———————————————
Ugh! Too many enemies to count...
Swing your sword with [W] to attack
nearby enemies. Use [B] to use your
bow on the rest!
———————————————
I'm only saying this to be safe,
but press [+][v] to set and check
your items!
———————————————
Oh, yeah! You can also check your
map with [+][>]!
———————————————
That glowing thing on its face is
the source of its raging power. So
aim for its face!
———————————————
And watch out for its flaming body!
———————————————
If it hunches over, just run away!
If its flame blast gets you, there
won't be a hair left on your head!
———————————————
Oh, it's flailing around! Grab one of
those chains and pull it to bring
that thing down!
———————————————
...But you're so light, it'll just drag
you around. Don't forget to make
yourself heavy with something first!
———————————————
Yes! Now it's down! Use your
sword to hit its weak spot!
———————————————
If you take too long, it'll just get up
again.
———————————————
Those four propellers atop these
columns seem to have some kind
of purpose... Maybe you should
use your boomerang to spin them.
———————————————
Arm yourself with the boomerang
using [B] and lock on to a variety of
places using [Z]. You can lock on to
up to 5 spots for each throw.
The boomerang will fly to targets in
the order that you lock on, so think
about the pattern as you lock on.

———————————————
Hey, wait! What's that big thing 
above your head?
———————————————
Looks like some kind of machine...
Is there a way to make it move?
———————————————
Looks like some kind of machine...
Does it have something to do with
that mechanism back there?
———————————————
This switch wouldn't even budge
under your weight.
———————————————
Try putting on something heavy and
stepping on it.
———————————————
This machine... It's a powerful
magnet. Maybe they used it to
transport ore?
———————————————
If you could wear something metal
that would be attracted by the
magnet, you'd be in for quite a
ride. [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
That bridge over there where the
magnet carries you is tethered by
those ropes.
———————————————
Well... Why not just cut the ropes?
If you had something you could aim
from a distance, that should work.
———————————————
What are you doing? Hurry up!
You know where its weak point is,
right? So use that sword!
———————————————
Oh, and by the way... If you feel
like you need Midna's advice, just
give me a signal by pressing [+^],
OK?
———————————————
What we're looking for... It may be
kind of hard to get...
———————————————
But don't you give up on me!
———————————————
--Shortcut Hint--
For a shortcut, use your
Clawshot to reach the metal
mesh above you.
———————————————
Rats! Looks like the bridge is up!
How can we get by here?
———————————————
Hey! If you could aim at those
ropes from a distance, you might
be able to cut them!
———————————————
It won't be easy from here. Swing 
your sword with [W] and use [B] to
use items strategically!
———————————————
Looks like there are a lot of
enemies... Swing the Nunchuk
lightly left and right to perform a
lethal spin attack!
———————————————
Just in case you forgot... If you
want to set or check your items,
just press ["-"]!

If you set your item to [+], you can
swap that item with the item set to
[B] on the fly.

There are also items that you can 
use simply by pressing [+], so
try different items out!
———————————————
Oh, and make sure to check the
map with [1]! Also, you can turn the
onscreen mini-map on and off
using [2].
———————————————
Hey! Hang on a sec! What's that
huge thing above your head?
Press [C] and move the camera
around to check it out!
———————————————
Use your bow to aim at distant
targets. Set it to and use it with
[Y] or [X] and use [o] to aim.
Release the button to fire.
———————————————
Use your bow to aim at distant
targets. Set it to and use it with
[+] and use [W] to aim the
red cursor. Release [+] to fire.
———————————————
Equip the Iron Boots to make
yourself heavy enough to
activate some switches or to
allow magnets to pick you up.
———————————————
The Gale Boomerang creates
whirlwinds , swirling objects off
the ground. Use [R] to lock on
to multiple targets.
———————————————
The Gale Boomerang creates
whirlwinds, swirling up objects
from the ground. Use [B] to
lock on to multiple targets.
———————————————
Press [B] to attack with your
sword. Press and hold [B] then
release to do a spin attack that
can strike all nearby enemies.
———————————————
Press [B] to swing your sword.
Whip the [N] around in a circle
to do a spin attack that can
strike all enemies around you.
———————————————
When attacking far-off targets
with your bow, do it from a
safe distance so their attacks
can't reach you!
———————————————
Hey, since there's a scarecrow
here, why don't you go ahead and
use it for some sword training?
———————————————
When there are enemies about,
press [L] to focus on them and
press [B] to swing your sword.
———————————————
If enemies surround you,
hold [B] for a while and release it
to perform a Spin Attack!
———————————————
That's it! You'll do fine in combat!
———————————————
You can take out enemies right in
front of you pretty quickly with
your sword, but faraway enemies
are different.
———————————————
Press the button you set
([Y] or [X]) to equip your bow,
and aim with [o] before you release.
———————————————
Why don't you try aiming for that
scarecrow?
———————————————
Well, that's good enough, I'd say!
Just be sure to keep an eye on
your supply of arrows, and try not
to run out!
———————————————
If there's an enemy nearby, press
[Z] to lock on and swing your sword
with [W].
———————————————
If you're surrounded by enemies,
shake your Nunchuk lightly left
and right to perform a spin attack!
———————————————
If you see a distant foe, aim at it
with your bow by pressing and
holding [B]. Aim the red cursor and
release the button to shoot.
———————————————
You have to do it in the right order!
Look around carefully!
———————————————
There it is! The last Fused
Shadow...
———————————————
I'll just take that, thanks!
———————————————
Now, don't resent me for all I've
put you through. I NEED this thing!
———————————————
Besides, we have to do something
about Zant, the one who thinks he
is the king of shadows...
———————————————
His power is a false one...
———————————————
I'll prove it using these!
———————————————
So...
———————————————
I've done everything I needed to.
I'm sorry for dragging you all over
the place with me...
———————————————
So... Shall we go?
———————————————
Getting that Zora armor was the
right idea, huh?
———————————————
It was a lot of work getting that
armor and then getting here, so
you'd better do whatever it takes
to get that last Fused Shadow!
———————————————
This place is much nicer than those
stuffy, hot Goron mines!
———————————————
So, where could that Fused Shadow
be? Hurry up and find it!
———————————————
This is one huge temple. Just trying
to find a single key is going to take
a lot of effort...
———————————————
Just do me a favor and don't get
lost!
———————————————
Do you remember which door was
locked? The door was surrounded
by red rocks, I think...
———————————————
Unlike you, I've got a memory like
a steel trap! [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
Why did those Zoras think it was a
good idea to build such a huge
temple?!
———————————————
It's a lot harder to look for stuff
when you don't rely on a map...
———————————————
Thought so... The passageway that
we took was once a waterway.
———————————————
I don't know if you noticed or not,
but...
———————————————
Look, the water's moving all sorts
of mechanisms down here! If we go
back to rooms we've already been
through, things may have changed.
———————————————
Ugh... That was so disgusting...
———————————————
Let's use that thing you found and
get out of here!
———————————————
If you forget the fact that it came
out of that nasty creature's mouth,
then it's much easier to appreciate
the treasure you just got.
———————————————
You remember seeing those
patterns in this temple that looked
like targets? Why don't you see if
you can target them with [target]?
———————————————
I'll bet if you keep pouring water
into places that look like
waterways, you'll be able to open
up closed passageways.
———————————————
Keep looking for areas that look
like water should be flowing
through them.
———————————————
All waterways should connect to
the large stairway in the central
room.
———————————————
Connect the waterway there and 
your goal should be in sight...
———————————————
We're so close to getting out of
here... Look carefully at the map
and check the places you haven't 
visited yet.
———————————————
I wonder if that huge rock hanging
from the ceiling would fall if you
blew it up?
———————————————
You don't remember...
———————————————
You've got bombs, right?! Blow that
thing up!
———————————————
I've got a bad feeling about this
guy...
———————————————
Ugh... What would you do without
me...
———————————————
If a bomb won't reach, you should
combine it with an item that can 
travel far.
———————————————
Aww, c'mon! Barnes the bomb guy
told you all about it! He even sent
you a letter!
———————————————
What are you doing?!
———————————————
I've got a baaad feeling about
this... Can't you feel it?
———————————————
Take a look around...
———————————————
Don't you feel anything? Use [C][v]
to take a good look around!
———————————————
There's something spooky in the
air...
———————————————
Ughh... It's creepy...
———————————————
I can't stand pimply things like
this...
———————————————
This one's all yours!
———————————————
I told you this one's all yours!
Stop calling me! That thing's gross!
———————————————
What are you doing floating
around?
———————————————
There's no going back up now. The
only thing you can do is dive!
———————————————
I can't see a thing...
———————————————
Look, the only thing we can do is
dive down and have a look around,
so hurry up and do it!
———————————————
Where do you think you're going?
The monster is down at the bottom!
———————————————
You can't do anything by floating
up!
———————————————
Get it together!
———————————————
You can't move around in the water
as quickly as you can on land, so
don't get overconfident!
———————————————
If you don't keep enough distance
between you and the enemy while
you're swimming, you'll be fish
bait in no time!
———————————————
Looks like that eyeball is pretty
important to him... See if you can't
[L]-target it and yank it right out of
the tentacle!
———————————————
Get too close and it'll attack you, 
so make sure to leave yourself
some room!
———————————————
Check your distance, target with [L],
and yank its eye out!
———————————————
Hey! Don't get too close to those
tentacles!
———————————————
If you get careless and get tangled
up in its tentacles, you're in for a
nasty fate...
———————————————
So, it's eyeball really is the key!
Good! Keep aiming for that eye!
———————————————
Did you see its back? It's got an
eyeball there, too!
———————————————
Just like you did last time... Target
its eye with [L], get close, and
attack with your sword!
———————————————
Don't let its size scare you!
———————————————
Even if it's huge, it should still 
have a weak spot!
———————————————
Keep it up! Get it!
———————————————
If you get in front of it, it'll suck
you in, so you've got to swim up
alongside it.
———————————————
Now, let's find a big locked door
to use that key on!
———————————————
Whoa! That's treacherous...
———————————————
Whoa! Don't you think you ought
to knock down those stalactites
hanging off the ceiling first?
———————————————
They don't look to be very stable.
I'd bet they'd break pretty easily
if you hit them with enough force,
don't you think?
———————————————
If you knock those stalactites
down, they'll probably make nice
little stepping-stones you can use.
———————————————
If you combine your bombs with
your arrows, you should be able
to hit them pretty easily, right?
———————————————
Don't you remember? You got a
letter from the guy at the bomb
shop in Kakariko...
———————————————
Whoa! There's a huge stalactite
here, too...
———————————————
So this whole temple is like one
giant waterway... Great. Not only
is it huge, but it's full of water-
powered mechanisms.
———————————————
I suppose it's here to protect the
Fused Shadow, but I wish we had
some way to take advantage of it...
———————————————
Eww... That wasn't good for my
appetite...
———————————————
Hey! What do you suppose is in the
treasure chest that thing spit up?
It's gross, but you should
probably open it...
———————————————
You know, I'd rather not linger in
the den of something as gross as
that thing was...
———————————————
Use that item you got to get us out
of here.
———————————————
Come on! Hurry up and dive so we
can see what's on the bottom!
———————————————
Your skills are great...but you
cannot test them against one such
as me.
———————————————
Welcome, Hero, to the Cave of
Ordeals.
———————————————
I am the Great Fairy. I reign over all
fairies of this realm as their queen.
———————————————
In praise of your efforts thus far,
I will release fairies to Ordon
Spring.
———————————————
More challenges await you up
ahead. If you want to truly measure
your skills, go beyond this point.
———————————————
Carelessness is forbidden. If you
want to return to the surface, tell
me now of your desire.
———————————————
More trials await you ahead.
———————————————
I have no more to teach you, but if
you wish to further test your
prowess, then continue on.
———————————————
You challenged this place once and
cleared every ordeal impressively.
———————————————
There is nothing more that I can
give you...but if you still want to
test your power, go forward.
———————————————
Hero, would you like to return to
the surface to prepare?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
If you return to the surface, you
will have to face the ordeals from
the beginning should you ever
return. Do you still want to go?
———————————————
I understand. I shall take you to
a spring where the fairies wait.
———————————————
In that case, please go on.
———————————————
I am impressed that you made it
this far, Hero.
———————————————
In praise of your courage, I award
you...power.
———————————————
The ordeals from this point forward
will surely become more cruel.
———————————————
It is impressive that you have made
it this far. Your trust in your skills
is your greatest asset.
———————————————
You cleared many ordeals...
How impressive.
———————————————
In praise of your courage, I will
give you this blessing.
———————————————
Drink this and you should be able
to clear any difficulties that you
might encounter ahead.
———————————————
Your courage... I will note it in my
heart.
———————————————
Many on the surface cry out for
one with powers like yours.
———————————————
You must go back.
———————————————
It is impressive that you have made
it this far. Your trust in your skills
is your greatest asset.
———————————————
If ever you need my assistance
again, visit any spring.
———————————————
Many on the surface cry out for
one with powers like yours.
———————————————
It is impressive that you have made
it this far. Your trust in your skills
is your greatest asset.
———————————————
Carelessness is forbidden. If you
want to return to the surface, tell
me now of your desire.
———————————————
More ordeals await you ahead.
———————————————
If you still wish to test your power,
proceed further.
———————————————
If you want to give up the fight for
now and go reequip yourself,
I can return you to the surface.
You need merely speak to me.
———————————————
Would you like to return to the
surface and hone your skills, Hero?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
If you return to the surface, you
will have to face the ordeals from
the beginning should you ever
return. Do you still want to go?
———————————————
I understand. I will take you to a
spring where the fairies await.
———————————————
Then go from me.
———————————————
From this point on, you will have
need of the ancient power that
allows one to walk along a cliff
without a single foothold.
———————————————
From this point on, you will have
need of the power that allows one
to break through massive, frozen
blocks of ice.
———————————————
From this point on, you will have
need of the power that allows one
to become master of lifeless
statues.
———————————————
From this point on, you will have
need of the power that allows one
to move freely from wall to wall.
———————————————
In praise of your efforts thus far,
I will release fairies to Faron
Spring.
———————————————
In praise of your efforts thus far,
I will release fairies to Eldin
Spring.
———————————————
In praise of your efforts thus far,
I will release fairies to Lanayru
Spring.
———————————————
I have seen your bravery from afar.
———————————————
May your courage spread light to
all living things.
———————————————
Many on the surface cry out for
one with powers like yours.
———————————————
If you want to give up the fight for
now and go reequip yourself,
I can return you to the surface.
You need merely speak to me.
———————————————
I think you are lost. It's got to be
around here somewhere...
———————————————
You still live... How astonishing.
No wonder some call you "hero."
———————————————
But this is truly a bittersweet
reunion... Truly!
———————————————
For I fear this is the last time I will
see you alive!
———————————————
The sand in here looks really
dangerous... Be careful, and don't
lose your footing.
———————————————
Hurry, [Link].
———————————————
There's no point in us being here.
Let's hurry up and gather the
mirror shards!
———————————————
I have a bad feeling about this...
Let's hurry up and finish him off.
———————————————
Ohh... I get it! You can't see it with
your human vision.
———————————————
In that case, why not use your
beast senses?
———————————————
Wolves can see things with their
senses that humans can't, right?
———————————————
We have to search for the three
ghosts that fled...
———————————————
But we'd get destroyed just looking
around randomly... You don't
suppose there's any clue as to
their whereabouts, do you?
———————————————
Let's look for a clue that'll help us
find those ghosts!
———————————————
Let's use the scent of those three
ghosts that fled to track them
down!
———————————————
Two more ghosts left for us to
catch...
———————————————
Be careful, and make sure you
don't get lost trying to figure
out which scent you're chasing.
———————————————
Good. We're down to one ghost...
Just follow that last scent trail!
———————————————
That big gate at the entrance
must've been tied to those
flames...
———————————————
Let's go, [Link]!
———————————————
We've finally reached the finale...
or something like that.
———————————————
I have no idea what lies ahead...
Gather your wits and let's go!
———————————————
What is this thing?! No matter
how much we tear it apart, it just
comes right back together again...
———————————————
Are we gonna have to bash his
bones into bits to keep him from
reforming?!
———————————————
Use your senses to find enemies
you can't see with your eyes!
———————————————
You can't do anything about an
enemy circling in the air while
you're in beast form!
———————————————
This thing just depresses me...
Get him down here and introduce
him to your blade!
———————————————
[Link], hurry! Now's your
chance!
———————————————
You're going to have to use both
your wolf powers and your human
skills!
———————————————
This thing uses the flowing sands
to protect itself. What a creep...
———————————————
Give it to him with that little
spinner of yours, [Link]!
———————————————
Take a good look...
———————————————
He may be ridiculously huge, but
there's only one bone that's
holding him up...
———————————————
If we could just destroy that one
support...
———————————————
Yikes! I guess that wasn't the end
of it! Staying down here is just 
going to make it easier for him to
do away with you, [Link]!
———————————————
Ride the rail on the wall to climb up
top!
———————————————
Yeah... You can't attack while
you're riding the rail...
———————————————
If things look dangerous, jump
across to the rail on the opposite
wall!
———————————————
Keep doing that until he gets close,
then do it again to ram into him!
———————————————
When he comes in to attack, that's
when we need to counter with our
own attack!
———————————————
Since you can transform into a
beast, this guy is nothing!
———————————————
All right, [Link], let's go!
———————————————
We're close to the Mirror of
Twilight...
———————————————
...Is he...dead? Somehow, I don't
feel very relieved by this...
———————————————
You've collected all the shards of
the Mirror of Twilight...
———————————————
Now, [Link], let's hurry!
To the Mirror Chamber!
———————————————
We must save Princess Zelda,
[Link]! We must!
———————————————
To Hyrule Castle!
———————————————
...Who?
———————————————
Uh...
———————————————
Sorry... I have sickness, uh...
———————————————
Come closer, uh?
———————————————
You cute little human. Husband
told me you come. You want to look
at mirror, uh?
———————————————
My husband found it, but it pretty
thing, uh.
———————————————
But...since I get mirror, I get sick,
and then bad monsters appear...
So many bad things happen since
mirror...
———————————————
So we lock bedroom on third floor
where it hangs, uh?
———————————————
Wait... I tell you where key is...
———————————————
Fever makes head blurry, but...
———————————————
It probably here in the room
marked by this symbol...
———————————————
Sorry about delay... I want to help,
uh...
———————————————
But right now...can't even get up.
———————————————
Would you bring it to me, uh?
———————————————
Start with door right here...
———————————————
I would go, uh, but so sick...
———————————————
Sorry to be bother, uh...
———————————————
You find it, uh?
———————————————
...What? Pumpkin? But why there?
———————————————
Uh... Sorry... Husband in kitchen
right now. Take pumpkin to him.
———————————————
I try to remember...
———————————————
No good, uh... Where I leave it?
———————————————
Uh! Maybe in THAT room.
———————————————
Go to room marked by symbol...
———————————————
Check room I marked on map, uh.
———————————————
What happened, uh?
———————————————
...What?! Cheese...
———————————————
Uh... Did husband move it?
———————————————
Husband making meal next door in
kitchen, uh. You take pumpkin
to him.
———————————————
I try to remember. We talk later, uh.
———————————————
Sorry... It not be wrong this time.
———————————————
It there. It must be, uh! You look
for me!
———————————————
I promise it right this time! Please,
you look for me...
———————————————
Oh! You safe, uh!
———————————————
I drink husband's soup, feel much
better, uh. So I come find you.
———————————————
You found key, uh! Good! Good!
———————————————
Bedroom right above us. I take you
there, uh.
———————————————
Please... This way, uh.
———————————————
Here...mirror. You look at it, uh...
———————————————
Uh... So pretty...
———————————————
Pretty... Uh... So pretty...
———————————————
NOT TAKE MIRROR!
———————————————
Uh... Uh... What... What wrong with
me?
———————————————
Very strange... You just
dreaming, uh.
———————————————
Yeto! Mirror you gave...
———————————————
Forget mirror, Yeta...
———————————————
Look in reflection of Yeto's
eyes. There true beauty!
———————————————
Who need mirror?
———————————————
My love, uh!
———————————————
This is bedroom... You unlock it,
uh?
———————————————
Thank you. You come inside...
———————————————
You have key, uh? So open door,
please.
———————————————
Uh, wait... I tell you something.
———————————————
No. Look into eyes of Yeto...
———————————————
Pretty... Pretty...mirror... Lovely...
———————————————
--Cannon Manual--
Insert.....iron....continue.....

———————————————
Uh... Where in world did we put
it...
———————————————
Sorry, I need thinking time, uh.
Take cheese to husband, uh?
———————————————
You do that, I try to remember...
———————————————
Uh, sorry... Still no remember
where bedroom key is.
———————————————
You take cheese to husband first.
———————————————
You do that, I try to remember...
———————————————
I think I remember, uh!
———————————————
We put key in nearby room, so no
forgetting, uh.
———————————————
How I forget? Embarrassing, uh.
———————————————
See! Here. Place marked by
symbol, uh!
———————————————
Bedroom right there, you go ahead.
No worry for me, uh?
———————————————
Love you, uh...
———————————————
Uh, love you, too...
———————————————
You gave pumpkin? Thank you, uh.
———————————————
I maybe remember. Could be

———————————————
Wolf... Sniff in house too much,
husband may eat you, uh.
———————————————
Wolf... Sniff in house too much,
husband may eat you, uh.
———————————————
Uh! Delicious wolf comes to
be cooked!
———————————————
But recipe not for wolf meat.
Too bad, uh.
———————————————
          --Cannon Manual--
Insert the item that will act as the
ammo, then insert a bomb to ignite.
———————————————
Uh! You!
———————————————
Wife...look bad, uh?
Not healthy since mirror...
———————————————
So I make soup for her.
———————————————
You tired, uh? You have
some. It give you energy!
———————————————
What flavor for soup, uh...
———————————————
Can't decide...
———————————————
What flavor...
———————————————
Uh... PUMPKIN!
———————————————
You have pumpkin, uh?
———————————————
Pumpkin, pumpkin, uh!
———————————————
Thanks, uh!
———————————————
You taste if you want!
———————————————
Uh...
———————————————
Needs...more punch, uh!
———————————————
Needs...something.
———————————————
Fish from Zora village are
most nutritious!
———————————————
That pumpkin, uh? Wife gave
it to me!
———————————————
Sploosh, uh! Right into
soup!
———————————————
Thanks, uh!
———————————————
You taste if you want!
———————————————
Uh...
———————————————
Needs...more punch, uh!
———————————————
Uh... WHAT?!
GOOD SMELL!
———————————————
What you have, uh?!
———————————————
Mmm! Perfect ingredient,
uh!
———————————————
Little more time on fire, it
become gourmet soup, uh!
———————————————
Here! Taste, uh!
———————————————
Mmm! Smells good, uh!
———————————————
Wife feel better when she
drink this.
———————————————
Hmm... I have a bad feeling here...
Be careful, [Link]...
———————————————
Doesn't he know how dangerous
that is, swinging a big metal ball
around in such a small place?!
———————————————
It's too dangerous to get close to
him, so let's use the ceiling to get
over to his other side!
———————————————
Hey, look at his backside... He's
covered in strong armor all over,
but his tail's exposed!
———————————————
After he throws that ball, do you
think you could get behind him and
whack his tail over and over?
———————————————
That's the way! Go for him after he
throws that ball!
———————————————
That metal ball... It looks heavy,
but since it's here, we may as well
grab it.
———————————————
And she seemed so quiet, too...
I guess that's the power of the
Mirror of Twilight...
———————————————
Let's get her out of that
ice-covered shell and release her
from the spell!
———————————————
Let's help her out! We need to
break more ice each time!
———————————————
Don't get distracted by the
columns of ice that keep falling...
———————————————
Avoid the falling ice columns and
aim for the last big one that falls!
———————————————
That's the way! Watch the ice
columns as they're reflected in the
floor and break the biggest one!
———————————————
Well, we have two mirror shards
now...
———————————————
Two more left, [Link].
———————————————
Still... I feel bad about the way we
treated that girl.
———————————————
To think the Mirror of Twilight has
the power to change people like
that...
———————————————
This world...ALL worlds...can be
cruel...
———————————————
Let's hurry up and collect the rest
of those pieces, [Link]!
———————————————
We have to, before more innocent
creatures have to endure the
suffering this poor girl did...
———————————————
Well, let's go search for the two
that remain.
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
What's this? This isn't right!
She got the wrong location.
———————————————
Want to go back and try to get her
to remember where the key is?
———————————————
Aw, food AGAIN?! Yeah, I had a bad
feeling about this. She didn't seem
very sure of herself...
———————————————
Oh well... Let's head back and hope
she had some other brilliant idea.
———————————————
The wife doesn't seem very
confident, but I think maybe it'll
work out this time.
———————————————
Well... I guess all we can do is go
back to that room that they told us
about.
———————————————
Why don't we go talk to the wife
again?
———————————————
Ugh... Give me a break... The wife
better remember where the key is
this time...
———————————————
That hairy thing's wife was calling
you... It's their house, so maybe
you should say hello.
———————————————
The mirror in Snowpeak Ruins...
I'll bet it's a shard of the Mirror of
Twilight.
———————————————
It's a huge mansion, so it'll be
hard...but let's find that shard and
take it back!
———————————————
We have no more business here!
C'mon, let's go!
———————————————
What a terrible storm...
Let's go, [Link].
———————————————
Borrowing the key is our only
chance to get into that bedroom...
———————————————
Let's ask again where the key is,
OK?
———————————————
Food AGAIN?! Give me a break...
———————————————
Unfortunately, our only option is
getting that girl to remember.
Ugh... Let's go ask her again.
———————————————
Finally! We have the key! Now, let's
go get that mirror shard from the
bedroom!
———————————————
I hope we get it right this time...
Just go to the spot on the map!
———————————————
Phew... We've finally found the key.
———————————————
That sure took a while...but that
mirror shard is as good as ours!
———————————————
...That's the hairy thing's wife?
Well, she did call you, so maybe
you should say hello.
———————————————
I was a little worried about how we
were going to find the shard, given
how big this place is... This map
will definitely come in handy!
———————————————
Let's go to the room that she 
marked and get that key!
———————————————
There's no use in waiting for the
wife to remember where the key
is... Maybe we should go give the
pumpkin to that hairy brute.
———————————————
Ugh! What a nuisance! I'd love to
help, but I don't think we'd quite
reach...
———————————————
There should be a mirror shard
here! There MUST be!
———————————————
Hurry up and let's find it!
———————————————
Well, we got the mirror shard, so
no use lingering... Let's return to
the world we left.
———————————————
This is an oddly organized and
quiet place...but it still has
an ominous feel to it.
———————————————
Let's see if we can find another
statue to match that one.
———————————————
The place we need to bring this
statue... You know where it is,
right?
———————————————
The statue belongs in the place 
we saw before... You know, where
the similar statue was.
———————————————
Now let's hurry up and find that
piece of the mirror so we can leave
this weird place behind!
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
Don't you think there's something
odd about that statue?
———————————————
In the grove and in the temple
entry, there were always matching
ones on each side, but there's only
one here...
———————————————
Why don't you use your senses to
take a look around?
———————————————
I knew it... There was one more
here originally.
———————————————
We need to find the other statue in
this temple that matches that one.
———————————————
I can't stop thinking about that
statue... Let's go find a matching
one, OK?
———————————————
I have no idea what to do against
these knight things!
———————————————
Just try using the sword techniques
you know, [Link]!
———————————————
The only thing to do is try all your
sword techniques on it until you
find one that works!
———————————————
Don't worry! You have what it
takes to beat him, [Link]!
———————————————
That is one big spider...
———————————————
And it's even got a big nasty eye
on its back... If that thing cast its
gaze on you, you'd be helpless...
———————————————
Your best shot is going to be after
you've knocked it down!
———————————————
If you don't hurry up and attack it,
it'll crawl back up to the ceiling!
———————————————
That thing is so heavily armored,
your sword just bounces right off...
———————————————
It's not just big. It's HUGE! I don't
know if any of your items could do
much to it, [Link]...
———————————————
It doesn't do much good to drop it
in front of a statue if you don't
move the statue once it's there!
———————————————
You have to watch its movements
while it's crawling around on the
ceiling!
———————————————
What a handy little spider-crusher!
———————————————
Go on! Just whack away!
———————————————
It sure is a persistent bug... Even if
it is just its eye, it's still alive...
———————————————
But now that its armored shell is
gone, you should be able to finish
it off with your blade!
———————————————
Three of the mirror shards are
ours!
———————————————
Just one left!
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
You saw how nasty that monster
was, right?
———————————————
The evil within the shards is more
powerful than you can imagine...
———————————————
You know, we could be assembling
something truly terrible here...
———————————————
It could be something that we'll
ultimately have to destroy...
———————————————
We have to hurry! Let's find the
last shard, [Link]! 
———————————————
We have to reach the sky! That's
where the last shard is supposed
to be!
———————————————
Goodness! Wait a second!
———————————————
Young man, could you be...the one
they call the hero?
———————————————
What? Really? So you're...erm...
just passing through...
———————————————
Are you kidding me?!
———————————————
Goodness, I thought so! Just as I
suspected!
———————————————
I have to tell you, my son and I 
have been looking for something.
———————————————
We can't return home until we find
that thing. Oh, gracious no!
———————————————
I won't help you warp to the
surface, but I WILL bring you 
back to this shop anytime!
———————————————
Erm! Not so fast!
———————————————
At last... This is it! This is where
I've been trying to get to!
———————————————
The ancient technology of our
people sleeps in this place.
———————————————
We've searched all over...and now
we're so close, I can SMELL it!
———————————————
Once we find that thing, we can go
home at last! Oh, gracious, yes!
———————————————
Erm, young man!
———————————————
We're so close...so PLEASE help us
find what we're looking for!
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
[ 8C]Bombs (30) 90 Rupees will do!
Why did I invest in stock that the
Oocca can't use?!
———————————————
[ 8C]Arrows (30) 30 Rupees will do!
I figured out that Oocca don't have
bows AFTER I ordered these...
———————————————
Red Potion 30 Rupees will do!
This makes 8 hearts beat
healthily.
———————————————
Blue Potion 100 Rupees will do!
When you're out of strength, drink
this and you'll be fine.
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern Oil 20 Rupees will do!
If you have an empty bottle, you 
should buy some.
———————————————
......



You are Hylian? No?



I speak a little Hylian.
You understand me?
———————————————
See something you want?
Pick it with [+][>].
———————————————
Buy something.
Pick it with [+][>].
———————————————
Come again!
———————————————
Want to buy [ 8C]30 bombs for 90
Rupees?
———————————————
[.]Buy!
[.]No, thanks.
———————————————
......You don't have enough Rupees.
———————————————
You'll waste what won't fit in your
bag... Is that OK?
———————————————
[.]That's fine.
[.]Never mind.
———————————————
I put the bombs in your bag. 
Thank you.
———————————————
Your bag is full and you can't buy
any more.
———————————————
Which bag should they go in?
[ 8C][quant.] [item]
 
———————————————
Which bag?
[ 8C][quant.] [item]
 
———————————————
Which bag should they go in?
[ 8C][quant.] [item]
 
———————————————
Which bag should they go in?
[ 8C][quant.] [item]
  
———————————————
Your quiver is full.
———————————————
Do you want to buy a set of 30
arrows for 30 Rupees?
———————————————
Thank you. I'll put them in your
quiver.
———————————————
You can't buy that without an
empty bottle. You knew that,
right?
———————————————
Do you want to buy some red
potion for 30 Rupees?
———————————————
Thank you. I'll put the red potion
in the bottle for you.
———————————————
Do you want to buy some blue 
potion for 100 Rupees?
———————————————
I'll put the blue potion in the bottle
for you.
———————————————
Do you want to buy some [ 8C]lantern
oil for 20 Rupees?
———————————————
I'll just put the lantern oil in the
empty bottle for you.
———————————————
I'm going to go ahead and put 
the lantern oil in your lantern
for you.
———————————————
You don't have a bottle! And your
lantern is full! You can't buy any
more!
———————————————
Ooh... Erm, sorry for earlier,
adventurer...
———————————————
Ooh! But you're planning on
walking around the city and taking
it in, right?!
———————————————
I'm worried about the others and
this is an emergency! I can't just
stand around waiting! Please take
me, too!
———————————————
Thank you so much, adventurer!
———————————————
Ooccoo knows! The one who saved 
us from the dragon... It was you?!
———————————————
Gracious, you've done so much for
us, adventurer!
———————————————
I hope you'll come see us again
sometime!
———————————————
I was going to show you around the
City in the Sky...but you've done
that alone.
———————————————
It's a lovely place, isn't it? Ooh,
gracious, yes! Come again
anytime!
———————————————
Hey! Ooh! Wait!
———————————————
Ooh, get those baddies! Get 'em!
Pleeeeeease!
———————————————
Ooh! You! Hey! Wait!
———————————————
Wow! You're awesome!
———————————————
I can help, too!
———————————————
My goodness! That is very helpful
of you, little boy!
———————————————
Can you...take a look at it, too?
———————————————
I don't know what's going on
inside, so if you need help, have
this little guy bring you right back
here!
———————————————
What did you think of the heavens?
———————————————
If you like it up here, you can live
here as long as like!
———————————————
What did you buy?
———————————————
Phew! Gracious, we made it back!
Finally!
———————————————
Welcome, adventurer! This is the
sky city of the Oocca.
———————————————
Erm, since you came all this way...
I guess I can give you a tour of the
city...
———————————————
EEEEEK!
———————————————
Ooh, goodness... Brave adventurer,
you won't believe it!
———————————————
There's a dragon raging outside the
city walls...
———————————————
Ooh, I'm terribly worried about
everyone... I'm going to check in
that shop for survivors!
———————————————
The sages said the final mirror
shard is somewhere in the Oocca
city.
———————————————
Find it and complete the Mirror of
Twilight!
———————————————
Who knew that another civilization
existed besides ours and
Hyrule's...and it hid up here in the
clouds.
———————————————
To the land below, [Link]! 
We have to save Hyrule!
———————————————
Zant hid that mirror shard in a
pretty good spot...
———————————————
Whoever would have thought there
was a place like this above Hyrule?
———————————————
Don't forget we're up in the sky
right now, [Link].
———————————————
Watch where you step, OK? Be
really careful...
———————————————
If you see an Oocca wandering by,
maybe you could try using it to
help you get around.
———————————————
...Because I'm pretty sure they're
trying to help you, [Link].
———————————————
You wore yourself out beating that
thing! Let's grab the treasure and
get out of this place.
———————————————
We should try climbing to all of the
places we couldn't reach before
with one of your gadgets!
———————————————
Take a good look around you...
———————————————
If you see a place you might be
able to latch on to, press [L].
———————————————
Once you've locked onto a spot,
try flying there the same way you
used to jump when you locked on
to me.
———————————————
If you hesitate, you'll fall!
———————————————
Are you locking on with [L]?
———————————————
Don't forget to press and hold it
when you see a place you might be
able to fly to.
———————————————
Take a good look around this room.
Do you see anything suspicious?
———————————————
What are you doing? Can't you see
there's another room below the
propeller?!
———————————————
Hurry up and get down there!
———————————————
Take a good look at his shield!
———————————————
When he holds it up, that's your
chance!
———————————————
When he's holding his shield up,
your arrows will just bounce off...
but that's exactly the chance you
need!
———————————————
If your timing is right, you could
use it to pull him down.
———————————————
All you can do is hang from there,
though...
———————————————
Isn't there something else you can
do while you're hanging there?
———————————————
Hey, it's that overgrown bird
again. Maybe it's lonely because it
can't fly down here...
———————————————
Isn't there some spot where we
can latch on to it? Then we could
pull it down to us!
———————————————
That thing's so big, [Link]!
Your weight alone won't pull it
down, I'm pretty sure.
———————————————
What are you supposed to do in a
situation like that? Come on, now!
Remember!
———————————————
That thing's not going to come
down if we just sit here waiting for
it...
———————————————
You won't have anywhere to run to,
but you should try and get close
and pull it down again.
———————————————
You saw its back, didn't you?
I bet that's its weak spot!
———————————————
We need to find a way to get up on
its back.
———————————————
Maybe we could get on its back
using those plants floating all
around it.
———————————————
Its back is its weak spot! Go for
that, will you?!
———————————————
That's it, keep attacking its weak
spot!
———————————————
If you don't stay sharp, that fire
will engulf you!
———————————————
The black fog... It stole the sparkle
from this land...
———————————————
We must return the two Sols
to the Pedestals quickly!
———————————————
You returned the Sols...
———————————————
Thank you...
———————————————
Without the Sols, the Pedestals of
Light are without their sparkle...
———————————————
Without the power of light, we
cannot enter the main palace...
———————————————
Zant controls our land now...
———————————————
This is the royal family's palace!
A traitor like Zant can't have it!
———————————————
This brightness... It's OUR light...
———————————————
Return the Sols to their proper
places... 
———————————————
Put one Sol on Pedestal II...
———————————————
I will NEVER call Zant the king!
———————————————
The only royalty we have is the
princess. She's still alive!
———————————————
And that's why we await the 
princess's return!
———————————————
If the two Sols are put in the
correct places, light will shine...
———————————————
This direction to Pedestal I...
———————————————
We've been waiting for help to
arrive...
———————————————
Return the palace to the hands of
the princess... Please...
———————————————
This sparkle... Our light...
———————————————
Return the Sols to their proper
places...
———————————————
Place the Sols adjacent, left and 
right...
———————————————
How did you get to this world?
———————————————
Could you...be the hero that the
princess sent?
———————————————
You must be the hero that the
princess sent...
———————————————
We will protect the palace until the
day that the princess returns!
———————————————
Thank you...
———————————————
Zant should be deep in the palace.
———————————————
We can't leave this land in his
hands! We CAN'T!
———————————————
We can't stay in the Twilight Realm!
We have to first fulfill our
obligation to Princess Zelda!
———————————————
[Link], let's go to Hyrule!
———————————————
Zant had his way with this place...
So much has changed...
———————————————
I can't show myself to them, but I
want to save everyone I can...
Please help me, [Link].
———————————————
[Link], hurry!
———————————————
My people are still not true beasts.
———————————————
If we can defeat Zant, there still
might be time to save everyone!
———————————————
The Sols were like the suns that
illuminate this world.
———————————————
Once they were lost, everyone 
began to transform...
———————————————
We've got to save them quickly...
———————————————
Ugh... Looks like this guy will take
some convincing before he lets
us take that Sol...
———————————————
Watch for the shadow of that
hand, [Link]!
———————————————
[Link], this isn't good!
———————————————
Hurry up and get that Sol back!
———————————————
Ugh! He took it!
———————————————
Oh, well. Let's go back to the room
where we first saw the Sol.
———————————————
I think you know what we need to 
do now, don't you?
———————————————
We'll get him next time!
———————————————
The Sol... It's gone!
———————————————
Oh, well. Let's go back to the room
where we first saw the Sol.
———————————————
Thank you, [Link]...
Because of you, these Twili
returned to normal.
———————————————
Let's go in search of Zant!
———————————————
[Link]... There should be
one more Sol.
———————————————
If we can find that, it should lead
us to Zant.
———————————————
If we can return the last Sol to its
original location, we should be able
to figure out where Zant is.
———————————————
Amazing... The power of the Sols
has been transferred to your
sword...
———————————————
The guardian deities of my world 
are on our side, too!
———————————————
You really are the chosen one,
[Link]... A true hero!
———————————————
As long as you have that sword,
you should be able to repel the
shadows Zant has spread!
———————————————
Use that sword to cut through the
darkness and follow the path
to Zant!
———————————————
Wait! This guy isn't an enemy,
[Link].
———————————————
They might look different, but...
they're inhabitants of this world...
They're my people.
———————————————
Zant... How could he...
———————————————
That shining sphere illuminates this
world. It's called a Sol.
———————————————
It's like the sun of your world, 
[Link].
———————————————
The power of the Sol is the source
of life in this world... It is pure
power.
———————————————
Ah! As long as you have this...
———————————————
Would you take this Sol to the Twili
at the entrance to this world?
Please, [Link]!
———————————————
[Link], be careful...
———————————————
This black fog is made up of
shadow crystals created by Zant.
They blot out light...
———————————————
He's responsible for stealing the
light from the spirits and turning
your world into twilight...
———————————————
But he's not all-powerful. We're
prepared too.  I can return you to
your normal state whenever you
need me, so don't worry, OK?
———————————————
If we waste our time dealing with
this, we'll never find Zant!
———————————————
Don't bother yourself with those
little nuisances! Attack Zant's
image!
———————————————
Didn't you notice something
strange in this room when we came
in here?
———————————————
You saw it, right?
———————————————
Shadow crystals flow like
waterfalls here... There's no way
we can get rid of all of them.
———————————————
Charge your sword up and release
the power of the Sol all at once.
———————————————
Attack with your sword by
spinning! You can do that, can't
you, [Link]?
———————————————
It's dangerous to take this Sol any
farther. Let's head back, OK,
[Link]?
———————————————
So Ganondorf was just using Zant
to help him return to the world of
light...

I guess now we know the true
nature of that barrier over Hyrule
Castle...
———————————————
He's in Hyrule Castle, I'm sure of
it...


Princess Zelda is in grave danger!
We must return to the world of
light and hurry to the castle!
———————————————
C'mon, let's use the mirror and get
back to the world of light!
———————————————
Let's return the Sol to the big
plaza near the entrance!
———————————————
Um, listen, [Link]...
Can I ask you one last selfish
favor?
———————————————
Regardless of what my reasons may
have been, I once abandoned this
world...
———————————————
I left behind the Twili. Those who
had followed me... Who considered
me their ruler...
———————————————
Even now, as they remain here,
suffering, they believe that help
will come for this world...
———————————————
But if they were to see that the
only help for them was a hideous
little imp... Don't you think they'd
feel let down?
———————————————
It's only for a little bit longer...
Do you mind if I continue to hide
as your shadow while you're in
human form?
———————————————
I'm sorry...
———————————————
You can't let Zant's crazy
movements confuse you...
———————————————
As long as you use the light of the
Twilight Realm to your advantage,
you'll be fine, [Link].
———————————————
The light in your blade can drive
back Zant's magic power!
———————————————
Where's Princess Zelda? We have
to find her and save her!
———————————————
Door...opens...where...spectres...
gaze... 
———————————————
In the land...where the rain stops...
the statue of time...moves.
———————————————
The cursed swordsman...sleeps
before...the sacred tree.
———————————————
Enough.
———————————————
I follow the strongest side!
...That is all I have ever known.
———————————————
I have come to play!
———————————————
[Link]... He...
———————————————
...He spoke.
———————————————
.........
———————————————
I'll try to slow Ganondorf with my
light arrows!
———————————————
You target him and stay at a
distance where my arrows will
reach!
———————————————
Your opponent may be a beast of 
pure evil, but remember, it's still
just a pig, [Link].
———————————————
You know when pigs start
running...they don't stop.
———————————————
In order to stop him, you'll have to
deceive his eyes.
———————————————
Did you see his belly?
———————————————
That's where he was injured long
ago, during his sentencing.
———————————————
That's his weak point!
———————————————
He's changing his strategy! Not
only can you not confuse him, but
you won't be able to attack!
———————————————
Beast against beast! How about
matching an evil beast against a
sacred beast?!
———————————————
Rather than run around, let him
charge you from the front!
———————————————
I'm going to do what you've been 
doing, [Link], only with my
power.
———————————————
Don't get distracted by his size,
[Link]! Watch his moves!
———————————————
Take aim at him when he charges
and deal a powerful blow!
———————————————
When he's down, without delay, run
to his belly and attack with your
sword.
———————————————
If you put me on your back like
you normally do, I'll hold him back,
[Link]!
———————————————
I'll hold his charge back, so while
I'm doing that, you do your thing!
———————————————
Just like that, [Link]!
Dodge his charge and attack his
stomach after he stops!
———————————————
That's it, [Link]!
I'll take care of his attacks, so you
counterattack when he's down!
———————————————
Aren't you curious what's on the
other side of this wall,
[Link]?
———————————————
There might be a way in. Want to
check it out?
———————————————
You've gotten everything you need
out here. Now get in the castle
through the front door!
———————————————
[Link], you did it!
It's the fourth shard!
———————————————
Now we have them all!
———————————————
Hey...[Link].
———————————————
The words of the sages... Do you
remember them?
———————————————
Only the true ruler of the Twili can
destroy the Mirror of Twilight.
———————————————
Zant could only break the Mirror of
Twilight into shards... He couldn't
utterly shatter it.
———————————————
That's proof of his false kingship.
———————————————
[Link], we have to hurry!
To the Mirror Chamber!
———————————————
After all, a fake is a fake...and no
matter how much you dress it up,
the real thing always wins!
———————————————
I'll wait here, so if you want to
come back, tell Ooccoo Jr.  with [+]!
———————————————
Ooh yeah!  If you want to get out,
just call me with [+]!
———————————————
Don't you feel anything? Hurry up
and use [C] to look around!
———————————————
Looks like that eyeball is pretty
important to it... See if you can't
[Z]-target it and yank it right out of
the tentacle!
———————————————
Check your distance, target with [Z],
and yank its eye out!
———————————————
Just like you did last time. Target
its eye with [Z], get close, and
attack using your sword!
———————————————
Is there something you're
interested in? Pick it with [<][+]!
———————————————
Buy something, please. Pick it
using [<][+].
———————————————
If you see a place you might be
able to latch on to, try pressing [Z].
———————————————
Are you using [Z] to lock on?
———————————————

———————————————
...Please...be careful... These woods...
have changed...
———————————————
The dark clouds of dusk cover this
land... This drape of shadows is
called...twilight.
———————————————
In this twilight, those who live in
the light...become as mere spirits...
It is a place...where the dark ones
and evil creatures dwell...
———————————————
...I...am a spirit...of light...
———————————————
...Blue-eyed beast.
———————————————
Look...for my light... Retrieve the light
stolen by the dark beasts...and keep
it...in this vessel.
———————————————
...Find...the insects of darkness...
———————————————
The dark insects... They are the
form taken by evil...once it has latched
on to...our scattered light...
———————————————
In the shadows of twilight...the dark
insects are as...invisible...as normal
beings are here...

Let me use the last of my power...
to reveal the locations of the dark
insects...that consumed the light...
———————————————
Mark...these words... In the shadows
of twilight...the dark insects are
as...invisible...as normal beings are
here...
Please...look in the places I have
marked on your map and recover the
Tears of Light from these...insects
of darkness...
———————————————
Huh? What is it?
———————————————
...What? What's the matter?
I think I'll just watch from here,
but you do your best, OK?
———————————————
Uh... I have a really bad feeling
about what lies up ahead here...
———————————————
Maybe some of that dark energy
the spirit told us about is lurking
nearby...
———————————————
Hm... Looks like we can get in there!
———————————————
Monsters and bugs could just
wander right in, you know!
Eee hee hee!
———————————————
You can't go that way! Bad wolf!
———————————————
Didn't I tell you that once you set foot
in the twilight, it won't be easy to get
back?
———————————————
If you want to return to the world
of light, then we need to finish what
we have to do in these woods!
———————————————
Aww... We're penned in again!
———————————————
Pffft! Who do they think they're
dealing with?
———————————————
No need to take these little pests
on one at a time, right? You can
take them all at once!
———————————————
So... You can handle this by yourself,
can't you?
———————————————
Good luck! 'Bye!
———————————————
Well, well... A spirit in here, too...
———————————————
Look there... You saw spirits under
the castle, right? Sharpen your
senses with [X]!
———————————————
Look there... You saw those under
the castle, right?
———————————————
Now, then... It's finally time for that
weapon I worked so hard to get!
———————————————
You probably already know this, but...
swing your sword with [B] and raise
your shield with [L]!
———————————————
I'm so helpful, aren't I? [sfx]Eee hee hee!
Just think of me when you use
those, OK?
———————————————
A very strange fellow lives back in
these woods, you know.
———————————————
I'm sure he knows all about this
place... Perhaps we should try to
find him?
———————————————
Hee hee hee! ...'Bye!
———————————————
Hee hee hee... That was fun!
I'll tell you what: I'll let you
into a secret place!
———————————————
Well, well... You're the chosen hero
and all that, huh? So THAT'S why you
turned into that beast!
———————————————
What a shame... I mean, maybe you'd
rather just wander as a spirit like the
rest of them, totally unaware of what
was happening for all eternity...right?
———————————————
[sfx]Eee hee hee! So... What do you want
to do? Do you want to head to that
temple?
———————————————
Well, isn't that convenient! I was
about to head there myself.
———————————————
Hey, look... You want to help your
friends, right?
———————————————
The way I see it, maybe they're in that
temple, waiting for you to rescue
them...
———————————————
Well, good luck, Mr. Important Hero!
———————————————
Eee hee hee! See you later!
———————————————
Hmm, I get the feeling this area is
even more dangerous than the last...
———————————————
Let me just say this... Don't try to
head into that fog without looking
around carefully, OK?
———————————————
Hey, what are you doing?! You can't
just run through this fog!
———————————————
You've got to look carefully to see if
there's a way through the fog!
———————————————
Hey, what's this monkey's problem?
———————————————
You idiot! While you were staring off
into dreamland, your lantern got
stolen!
———————————————
Just follow her...and make sure
you remember the way!
———————————————
Hmm... [sfx]Eee hee hee! Perfect!
———————————————
I'm pretty sure the thing I'm looking
for is in that temple the spirit was
talking about.
———————————————
Hey... You haven't forgotten your
promise to me, have you?
———————————————
If you don't find what I'm seeking,
I won't help you return to the lands
of twilight.
———————————————
Now do your best...my little hero!
[sfx]Eee hee hee hee!
———————————————
What's the holdup?
———————————————
If you leave the last one alive, it's
just going to use that shriek to
bring the others back.
———————————————
Listen, let me help you out here!
Just move like I tell you!
———————————————
You just hold down [B] and I'll expand
an energy field, so enclose all the
enemies within it and release!
———————————————
Press and hold [B] and I'll put up a
dark energy field... You trap all of
these guys inside of it and then
release the button!
———————————————
Hey! What are you going to do
about that monkey?
———————————————
She's got your lantern! We need to
chase her!
———————————————
Hey, look! That monkey is calling
you or something!
———————————————
Hey! You listen to that monkey!
———————————————
I'm giving you an order! Do what I
say, or else!
———————————————
See! I told you. We're here!
———————————————
You know, most people can't leave
the twilight that easily. You'd better
be grateful!
———————————————
It's your job to look for the bridge!
Look hard!
———————————————
No good! No good!
———————————————
Didn't I tell you? Returning to the
world of light isn't easy!
———————————————
...Before we get going, don't you want
to pick that up?
———————————————
Heroic [Link]...
———————————————
Do not think that Hyrule is now saved
from the spread of twilight...
———————————————
Leave these woods and go to the
east, where you will find the land
protected by the spirit Eldin.
———————————————
There you will find those you seek...
———————————————
But know that these lands lie in
twilight... They are now a dark realm
covered by the clouds of dusk.
———————————————
If you set foot beyond the curtain of
twilight, you will revert to your beast
form, so be prepared.
———————————————
Hero chosen by the gods... Leave
these woods and go to the east, to
the land of Eldin.
———————————————
Wow! It's perfect, don't you think?
———————————————
What do you think? Should we take it?
———————————————
[.]Warp
[.]Speak to Midna
———————————————
Hey... Have you looked around at all?
That thing doesn't look like it belongs
here, does it?
———————————————
How many times do I have to say it?!
It's perfect for the bridge! OK?!
———————————————
......
———————————————
Twinkle, twinkle, little Cucco...
I am gold and not for you-oo...
———————————————
What's going on?! Where'd it run off
to?!

———————————————
This time, try fighting with a little
strategy! Don't leave one to bring the
others back!
———————————————
The more I look at it, the more perfect
it becomes! Maybe you just don't
understand...
———————————————
Good little obedient wolf!
———————————————
You should've listened to me from
the beginning!
———————————————
[<] Forest Temple Path

It's pitch-dark ahead! Parties
interested in going forward
must first go this way! [>]

                        Coro
———————————————
Hmm... Even with the light back, this
place kind of looks the same.
———————————————
But hey, what about your lantern?
Remember what the oil seller said?
———————————————
Don't be stingy! It's better to burn oil
than wander in dark fog!
———————————————
Hey! Hey! You! Over here! Money!
Put some money in!
———————————————
Hey! I've been waiting! Welcome!
———————————————
Welcome! Hey! Buy something!
Anything!
———————————————
Pfft! Stingy! Cheap!
———————————————
Hey! THIEF! STOP!
———————————————
Thank you! Hey! Thank you!
Come back sometime! Hey!
———————————————
...Pay like you're supposed to next
time, you cheapskate...
———————————————
Stop... THIEF!
———————————————
Hahhhh...
———————————————
It's rough, having to watch a shop in
this unpopular part of town...
———————————————
The other day my master got mad at
me for letting a thief steal stuff...
———————————————
I was so frustrated that I put water in
the oil urn!
———————————————
Even though I watch after this shop
every day, he never shows any
appreciation...
———————————————
I think my master probably didn't 
get much praise growing up...
———————————————
    Menu
Pumpkin    5 Rupees

Just drop the money in the box!
Hey! Just drop it!

You're paying this time? Hey!

———————————————
Thanks! Hey! Thanks so much!
———————————————
Hey! What a generous young man!
———————————————
...That's a bit on the skimpy side...
———————————————
Those village kids got led through
the woods for some reason...
———————————————
The whole forest is so weird now...
What's happened?
———————————————
Yeek eek! Help!
———————————————
Someone... Someone helped me?
———————————————
Boy, lucky for me... Ever since the
boss went funny in the head,
there've been scary monsters
everywhere...
———————————————
That boss of mine... I don't know
why he got so mean! Turning on
his friends like that! Hrrrmph!
———————————————
I wish we could do something
about him, but all 8 of us are so
spread out...
———————————————
I really need to go back to the
temple to look for my friends...but
I can't do it without help!
———————————————
I need to get back to the temple
quickly! I need to find my friends!
———————————————
But how am I supposed to help
them all on my own?!
———————————————
The boss is threatening his friends...
The village kids got kidnapped...
———————————————
I mean, what's going on in these
woods now, anyway?
———————————————
We are guardians of this land...
———————————————
Guide us to where we once stood.
———————————————
Only then can you enter the true
Sacred Grove...
———————————————
Beast who speaks to our hearts...
what would you have of us?
———————————————
[.]Try again
[.]Quit
[.]Continue
———————————————
Go now to the sacred place, beast...
———————————————
We yield passage to the Sacred
Grove...
———————————————
Without a key, you cannot proceed...
———————————————
It's locked...
———————————————
Did... Did you save me?
———————————————
Th-Thank you!
———————————————
Listen, since you're so nice, let me
tell you something: there's a really
pretty wooded area on the other
side of this cliff!
———————————————
I climbed over there, but when I
tried to get deeper into the woods,
THOSE guys attacked me!
———————————————
What's in those woods, anyway?
———————————————
That sure is a pretty forest...
———————————————
You know, the one I found over
there, on the other side of the cliff.
———————————————
If you're going, please be careful!
———————————————
Your smell... It's so familiar...
———————————————
It smells a bit like a green-clad
prince who helped me out once!
———————————————
Huh... Um... A wolf? Am I dreaming?
———————————————
Huh... What? A wolf again...
———————————————
My, it sure is rare to see wolves around
these parts...
———————————————
You're a good boy now, aren'tcha?
Good boy... Don't hurt me...
———————————————
Say, you seem to like people...
———————————————
But I bet even a good pup like you
gets the evil eye from people just
'cause you're a wolf.
———————————————
But me, I'm not worried about you,
little guy. My older sister is much
scarier than you.
———————————————
[.]Buy!
[.]Never mind.
———————————————
Hunh?!
———————————————
So... It's the Ordonian!
———————————————
You seemed familiar, but then your
clothes seemed kinda different, so I
got thrown off for a second!
———————————————
Listen... Things have been a little
rough around here lately, so you
should watch your step, OK, guy?
———————————————
There are so many monsters now...
I got kinda scared and closed off
the path to the temple.
———————————————
But... You, guy... You wanna get back
there, huh?
———————————————
You sure do look geared up for it...
So here you go!
———————————————
Oh yeah... The woods on the other
side of this cave are covered in really
thick fog, so make sure your lantern
is full!
———————————————
You're definitely going to need to use
your lantern a lot in there, so bring all
the oil you can!
———————————————
And check this out! I have a special,
one-time offer of a bottle full of
lantern oil for only 100 Rupees!
How 'bout it, guy? What a bargain!
———————————————
But I gave you that lantern for free... Man...
———————————————
Thanks a lot, guy! Here you go!
———————————————
...............
———————————————
OOO-WAAAH!
———————————————
Oh... It's you, guy. Thanks for uh...
waking me up, there.
———————————————
So, you need oil, guy?
———————————————
I have a special, one-time offer of a
bottle full of lantern oil for only
100 Rupees. How 'bout it, guy?
———————————————
Huh... Wha--? You...
Are you the Ordonian?
———————————————
Hoo, that threw me for a loop, guy!
I was wondering who it might be,
and then it turns out to be just the
Ordonian...
———————————————
Don't you know it's dangerous to
wander around the woods at night
without a light?
———————————————
And I gave you a lantern, guy!
Why don't you use it?!
———————————————
I mean, you've gotta be careful with
your oil level and all!
———————————————
Even with a lantern, you don't wanna
be hanging around these woods
at night, guy!
———————————————
It's kinda rough around here lately,
so be careful, OK?
———————————————
There are so many monsters now, I
had to close the gate to the temple...
———————————————
And don't go sneaking up on me when
there are REAL monsters out there,
y'hear me, guy?!
———————————————
And I'm sure you used it all up that
day you went to the temple!
———————————————
And you can put all kinds of stuff in
the bottle once you use all of the oil
inside, guy!
———————————————
And hey... Keep using that lantern so
you'll come back and buy more oil,
OK, guy?
———————————————
Your clothes look so different, I hardly
recognized you, guy!
———————————————
Right now we have a 100-Rupee oil
bottle and 20-Rupee refills to choose
from!
———————————————
[.]Buy an oil bottle
[.]Buy a refill
[.]Quit
———————————————
Oh! You can't...
———————————————
If you want to take it, guy, you have to
heat it to make it safe!
———————————————
Hmm... You can't...
———————————————
You have to heat it...
———————————————
You hungry, guy?
———————————————
If you want some soup, feel free 
to have as much as you'd like.
———————————————
But I don't know if you'll like it...
so don't blame me if you get sick,
OK, guy?
———————————————
...Oh...
———————————————
Ah... Hey, guy... You hungry?
———————————————
I also sell oil on its own, so come
back when you run out, guy!
———————————————
When it's dark, use your lantern!
It's common sense, guy! Don't forget!
———————————————
The woods on the other side of the
cave can get really dark, especially
when it's foggy, so don't forget to use
your lantern there as well!
———————————————
And how's your oil level looking,
guy?
———————————————
If you're going all the way in, you'd
better bring some extra!
———————————————
And check this out! I have a special,
one-time offer of a bottle full of
lantern oil for only 100 Rupees!
How 'bout it, guy? What a bargain!
———————————————
Wh-What's with these bugs? Those
things aren't normal!
———————————————
They're so big... So weird...
So creepy...
———————————————
C'mon, get away, bugs... Shoo...
Get out of here...
———————————————
Awww, come on, bugs... I mean,
gimme a break, guy... You can't
just wander around people's
houses like that...
———————————————
You stay away, bugs... Seriously,
just back off...
———————————————
Wh-WHAAT? They just...died?
———————————————
Oh, boy, I have NO idea what's
going on around here...
———————————————
Are there more of those bugs...
outside?
———————————————
Ohh... Maybe I should just lay low
for a while...
———————————————
I don't even have a lantern to guide
my way if I needed to go check on
things... Oh, boy...
———————————————
I wonder if you could cross along
the tops of trees...
———————————————
Naw, that's crazy... Only monkeys
can do that...
———————————————
Aww... This stinks...
———————————————
I mean, if all of my goods get
sucked up by weird, giant insects,
what am I gonna do?
———————————————
Oh, boy... I can just picture it
now... Noooooo!
———————————————
Say, guy, you been to the Forest
Temple yet?
———————————————
Isn't it great? I mean, sure,
there've been a couple monsters
stirring things up lately, but still...
———————————————
That's just the world we live in
right now, know what I mean?
Things are rough all over...
———————————————
Say, guy, you going somewhere now?
———————————————
You just remember that the world's
a mess, guy! Seriously! You watch
your back out there!
———————————————
Hey, and you want some advice?
Two words: be plenty careful
around that Zora's River.
———————————————
Whoa! An Ordonian! Hey, guy!
———————————————
Listen, I'm not sure you should be
wandering around the woods without
a lantern. Just because it's daylight
doesn't mean it's safe.
———————————————
There are a ton of caves and dank
spots around here that get pretty dark
even in the middle of the day.
———————————————
Here! Go on, guy. Take this!
———————————————
See, I sell lantern oil here...
———————————————
I'm trying to drum up sales by giving
away free lanterns! It's a business
tactic, guy!
———————————————
See, as long as you've got oil to fuel
your lantern, you can light your way
and set fire to stuff. They're the best!
———————————————
Go on, guy! Try setting a fire under
that big pot!
———————————————
Go on! Set a fire under that big pot
so you can get a taste for just how
amazing lanterns are!
———————————————
Set the lantern on the [+][v] Items
screen to either [Y] or [X] and then use
that same button to swing it!
———————————————
First, you wanna hold the lantern and
the oil with [Y] and [X] and then pour
the oil into the lantern to refuel it!
———————————————
See? Check out that pot, guy.
———————————————
Whoa! Your lantern's out of fuel, guy!
———————————————
If you don't refuel it, you'll regret it
later! Trust me on this one.
———————————————
So I can fill it to the brim with oil for
just 20 Rupees!
———————————————
What?! That's not right, guy...
———————————————
Guy, I GAVE you the lantern...
———————————————
Aw, no, guy! Th-This won't do! You
don't have enough Rupees!
———————————————
That's great, guy. Let me refill your
lantern!
———————————————
That's right! See! It's on fire, guy!
———————————————
Yeah! You keep using that lantern
anytime you feel the need. And if it
runs out of oil, you come see me to
get it refilled!
———————————————
You keep using that lantern, and if
it runs out of oil, come see me, guy!
———————————————
There's a really dark cave over
thataway. You can get some use out
of your lantern there, for sure!
———————————————
Hey, guy! How's the oil level in your
lantern?
———————————————
I'll fill your lantern to the brim for just
20 Rupees!
———————————————
For just 20 Rupees I can fill either
your lantern or an empty bottle!
———————————————
Thanks, guy! Anytime you need a
lantern filled, I'm your guy!
———————————————
Huh... But you don't have an empty
bottle, and your lantern is already full,
am I right, guy?
———————————————
I can fill that empty bottle for
20 Rupees!
———————————————
GRRRARRR! FWEEEEEEEEEEET!
Hey! Punish the evildoers!
———————————————
...Huh? Hey! The evildoers are all
gone?
———————————————
...Wait, are you...a customer?
———————————————
Oh! Hey! Sorry! So sorry! Please
forgive me!
———————————————
Woo! Hey! Woo! You're super!
———————————————
Now just buy something! Hey!
———————————————
Forest Temple Ahead  [v]

Got enough lantern oil?
If not, stop at Trill's!
———————————————
TRILL'S SHOP

Make payment at the box near
the shopkeeper.
———————————————
Trill's Shop is straight ahead!
We have lantern oil!
———————————————
Just drop money in the box to pay
for goods at Trill's Shop.
———————————————
That's better. Searching should be
much easier now. [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
But... Of course, you feel the need
to go help the other light spirits,
don't you?
———————————————
Well, don't worry. When you turn into
a beast again, I'll take good care of
you.
———————————————
The first thing you need to do is find
the land covered in twilight. Once you
do, I'll help you out.
———————————————
Eee hee hee! See you later!
———————————————
Uh! You sled down that snow?
———————————————
We race back to my house
then, uh?
———————————————
Uh! Rare color of wolf!
———————————————
Looks tasty...
———————————————
But tonight fish night. Maybe
another time.
———————————————
Friendly, uh?
———————————————
I take you home with me, uh?
...If I did not have fish.
———————————————
Uh! Whoa-ho!
———————————————
I heard ruckus, and uh!
Just a human!
———————————————
I see humans not often, uh?
Why human come to snows?
———————————————
You...on spiritual journey?
You look for true self?
———————————————
[.]Yes, I am.
[.]Umm, no.
———————————————
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh!
You look for long time!
———————————————
...That was joke. Yetis joke
too, uh.
———————————————
You look for something else,
uh? Tell truth.
———————————————
...You rude.
———————————————
...Uh. You look for mirror in
such faraway place...
———————————————
But you make good climb!
And you lucky to meet me!
———————————————
I found shiny mirror piece.
———————————————
Same mirror you look for, uh?
———————————————
Uh! You come to house and
see yourself!
———————————————
I caught fish. I make you
hot meal, at least...
———————————————
Uh! Rare color of wolf!
———————————————
Looks tasty...
———————————————
My house far away... We slide
there, uh? Do like me! Come!
———————————————
No worry, uh? You watch and

But you make good climb!

wolf. Me remember!

Meat in morning? No...

———————————————
Long time since we meet, uh!

———————————————
He love race with you, too, uh!

You slimmer than husband, uh...
Hmm, maybe that your secret!

———————————————
...And no tell husband!

———————————————
So much fun, uh! You come back

Still, so much fun, uh! You come

———————————————
...Uh! Why long face?!
———————————————

———————————————
Yes! See you at top!
———————————————
...Aww, no sad face, uh.
———————————————
You race again?
———————————————
Great, uh! We meet back at top.
———————————————
Hey... You're [Link], yeah?
———————————————
You don't remember me? I'm Ashei.
Telma looks out for me, so I'm at
her bar pretty often.
———————————————
Look, I'm sorry I was rude to you
back then. I didn't mean it...
———————————————
I mean, all those cowardly soldiers
in Hyrule right now... It's kind of
unexpected to see a warrior with
any courage, know what I mean?
———————————————
Anyway... What are you doing in a
dangerous place like this?
———————————————
I've heard great things about you...
Telma looks out for me, so I stop by
her bar pretty often. I'm Ashei.
———————————————
Anyway... What are you doing in a
dangerous place like this?
———————————————
[Link].
———————————————
What brings you to a dangerous place
like this?
———————————————
Ever since Zora's Domain got covered
in ice, this mountain's been much
colder than usual, yeah?
———————————————
Not only that, but I heard a really
weird story from the Zoras.
———————————————
Apparently, the beast that lives
somewhere on this mountain has been
seen frequently in Zora's Domain.
———————————————
I was curious, so I came and waited...
and as they'd said, a giant appeared!
———————————————
Yeah, it looked like this...
———————————————
Apparently, this thing's been stealing
red fish from the village.
———————————————
I want to investigate further...but I
can't even see the path through this
blizzard, yeah?
———————————————
I'm sure you're here because you're
curious about the mountain, but you'd
best not go without a plan.
———————————————
If you go into this blizzard without a
plan, you'll get lost...and that'll only
lead to disaster, trust me.
———————————————
The only clues we have right now are
the stories of the Zoras and my
sketch. It's not much, I know.
———————————————
The sketch turned out pretty good,
though, yeah? Tell you what... You can
have it.
———————————————
But still... I wonder why this thing has
to steal fish in the first place?
———————————————
I'd never seen anything like it...
It was huge! And it had a really
distinct smell...
———————————————
It has been a while since we took a
walk in the forest, huh? Yes, and
how our world has changed...
———————————————
Say...
———————————————
Do you know about the far side of this
deep gorge? Some say there is an
ancient temple deep in the woods
that guards a sacred power.
———————————————
The ancestors of the Hylians
created the temple... Signs of their
civilization--ancient, but very
sophisticated--are everywhere.
———————————————
If someone could obtain the power
of those ancient people... Well, I
am sure it would go a long way
toward saving Hyrule.
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
Would you take on this task?
Would you cross the gorge and find
the ancient power sleeping in the
temple?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
I knew you would!
———————————————
To cross the gorge, just use my
partner here.
———————————————
...Do you doubt my partner's
skills? He flies like a dream!
Believe me!
———————————————
Well, you will definitely make it
across the gorge. Wait and see,
my doubting friend.
———————————————
Getting across the gorge and
entering the temple will be
difficult, make no mistake.
———————————————
...But I am sure you can do it.
———————————————
If only I had your courage and
strength, I, too, would fight to
restore the peace...but I am not
the man I once was.
———————————————
[Link]...
———————————————
Would you take on this task?
Would you cross the gorge and find
the ancient power sleeping in the
temple?
———————————————
Restore the peace! Reclaim the
power of this ancient civilization
that has slept in the temple for
ages beyond count!
———————————————
My partner will definitely get the
job done! No doubt in my mind!
Give it a shot!
———————————————
I knew you would come.
———————————————
I have heard of your brave acts
from Telma...
———————————————
I have known her circle of friends
since my youth, and of late we have
begun to work toward a common
goal.
———————————————
...So. Let me tell you a story.
———————————————
What is this thing?
———————————————
It does seem to be man-made.
I wonder what it is?
———————————————
Why is it there? It doesn't look
like it's been there long, does it?
———————————————
Hey... Where do you think you're
going in a blizzard like this?
———————————————
I don't think you have any business
here, do you? You'd better go back
before you freeze to death!
———————————————
What a terrible storm... Looks like
you're not welcome here...
———————————————
Trying to break through that storm
will only bring you death! Trust me!
Let's head back for now...
———————————————
Look, I understand that the mirror
is hidden somewhere on this
mountain, but we need a plan...
———————————————
I know... That story that Ashei told 
about the beast... What do you
think about that?
———————————————
You think we should show that
sketch to the Zoras and see what
they have to say?
———————————————
Forcing our way through the
darkness of the storm is the path
to certain doom. Let's find a
landmark to mark our way.
———————————————
...Here?
———————————————
What's with this guy? He's got a nice
place...for a beast-man.
———————————————
Go home, you savages! Go on, git!
I don't have any food left to feed
you monsters!
———————————————
And I don't know anything about
the girl!
———————————————
I'm not opening up until every last
one of you is gone! You heard me!
So get out of here!
———————————————
The howls of the beasts... They've
faded into silence...
———————————————
Wait, are you...
———————————————
The savior! It's you, the savior!
———————————————
Please, please forgive me...for not
opening up the door.
———————————————
My name is Impaz. I'm the last
resident of this poor village.
———————————————
My name comes from the great one
who built this village so long ago...
———————————————
This village was once the secret
home of a proud tribe who served
the royal family...
———————————————
But it fell into decline, and became
infested with dangerous beasts. It's
become an awful place...
———————————————
Excuse me for asking, but is your
name...[Link]?
———————————————
Ah! I knew it...
———————————————
So then, you saved that nice girl?
———————————————
...How lovely.
———————————————
When she was here, she would
often cheer me up by saying that
you would come to help.
———————————————
That sweet girl... She worried about
this old woman even as I helped her
to escape from here...
———————————————
By royal order, I can't leave this place
until a certain person arrives.


...No matter what terrible fate is
visited upon it...
———————————————
Oh, but listen to me blather on!
I have a favor to ask: would you
help me return this to her?
———————————————
I think she always kept it close to
her heart, but even so, she didn't
hesitate to part with it in order to
protect me...
———————————————
I believe in my heart that it's kept
me safe all this time...
———————————————
So please... I ask that you return
it to that girl.
———————————————
That dear girl deserves her charm
back.
———————————————
...And tell her that this old biddy
was very grateful.
———————————————
Since you chased the beasts away
from this village, my little ones
have returned...
———————————————
Now that I'm no longer alone,
my loneliness has faded.
———————————————
Please...tell her that as well.
———————————————
Is that girl doing all right?
———————————————
I haven't much to offer, but please
make yourself comfortable here...
———————————————
There is a hidden village up ahead,
little human. The elders call it a
forgotten place.
———————————————
This scent that has been burning my
nostrils...it is the scent of evil.
———————————————
There is one powerful creature I have
seen about...but under that beast are
many minions who attack and plunder
like a pack of hyenas.
There are 30... No... At most, 20 of
them ahead...
———————————————
They are probably just a small band of
survivors... Ragged remnants who have
settled, leaderless, into this village.
———————————————
If that is all there are, little human,
then you alone are more than enough
for them. But you will have to defeat
them ALL to save that girl's benefactor.
———————————————
Before you go, I will tell you the secret
to besting them: destroy them all
before they spot you!
———————————————
Got it, little human?
———————————————
Hey! That rod...
———————————————
Is that the Dominion Rod?
———————————————
Ahh... Could it really be? Are you
the messenger to the heavens?!
———————————————
Among the legends of my clan,
there is a story from the time when
the Oocca still maintained contact
with the royal family.
———————————————
Yes, it said that a mysterious rod
was handed down from the people of
the sky, and it was called the
Dominion Rod...
———————————————
The rod was only to be carried by the
messenger to the heavens when the
royal family needed to communicate
with the Oocca.
———————————————
From generation to generation, my
ancestors have guarded the book
that, by royal decree, was to be given
to the messenger to the heavens.
———————————————
This is that book. Please, take it.
———————————————
This book is written in the ancient
language of Sky Writing.
———————————————
I am so glad I stayed in this village...
If I had not met that young girl,
what would have become of me?
———————————————
Meeting that girl must have been
ordained by the gods, so that I could
be here today to pass on this
knowledge...
———————————————
Yes, I was meant to pass on that
ancient book from the heavens to
you...
———————————————
Please, take care of yourself.
———————————————
Ah, [Link]... I am so glad you
are well.
———————————————
Thanks to you, I have been spending
my days in peace.
———————————————
Thank you so very much.
———————————————
And with these little ones here to
keep me company, I never feel alone.
———————————————
I have little to offer, but please make
yourself comfortable here...
———————————————
A sword wields no strength unless
the hand that holds it has courage.
———————————————
You may be destined to become the
hero of legend...but your current
power would disgrace the proud
green of the hero's tunic you wear.
———————————————
You must use your courage to seek
power...and find it you must. Only
then will you become the hero for
whom this world despairs.
———————————————
If you do find true courage, and
you wish to save Hyrule from the
horrors it now faces...
———————————————
Then you will be worthy to receive
the secrets I hold!
———————————————
No matter how well-tempered a
blade is, if a foe is clad in armor
and bears a shield, the sword will
do it no harm.
———————————————
When facing such a foe, you must
use [R] to thrust your shield against
the defenses of your enemy,
causing the fiend to recoil.
———————————————
Use [L] to lock on to me, then try it!
You have learned much, so I am sure
you can see the moment when you
can do a shield attack!
———————————————
What ails you? You cannot shield-
attack with [R] unless you lock on
with [L] first!
———————————————
Get closer to your foe and
shield-attack with [R]!
———————————————
After you shield-attack with [R] and
send your foe reeling, attack with
your sword immediately!
———————————————
Excellent! Open a hole in your
enemy's defenses and use your
sword to strike without hesitation!
———————————————
The shield attack I have just taught
you can also be used to repel
an enemy's projectile attacks.
———————————————
Would you practice? Then repel
my magical attack with your shield
attack [R]!
———————————————
You cannot reflect my spell back
toward me unless you press [R] just as
it hits your shield.
———————————————
You must lock on with [L]! This is a
fundamental of combat!
———————————————
Perfect! When your enemies assail
you with projectiles, this is how
you will defeat them with ease!
———————————————
Done! You have learned the second
of my hidden skills, the shield attack!
———————————————
But I have five more secrets to 
teach you...in time.
———————————————
Those are only for one who carries
the blood of the hero...the one
whose spirit is that of the sublime
beast.
———————————————
Grow powerful. Test your courage.
And when you find that you need
another skill to overcome the
threats that face you...
———————————————
Search for the statues that howl with
the sound of the wind. Seek the
sound that calls to the spirit of the
beast to awaken me again.
———————————————
A sword wields no strength unless
the hand that holds it has courage.
Remember those words...
———————————————
Farewell!
———————————————
You learned the second hidden
skill, the shield attack! Lock on to
a foe with [L] and press [R] to thrust
your shield, dazing your enemy!
———————————————
Hidden Skill - Shield Attack
———————————————
Sword Basics
———————————————
Before I introduce you to secret
techniques, I must confirm that you
know how to handle a sword at
the most rudimentary level.
———————————————
First, the basics. Lock on with [L]
and show me how you slice with
that sword.
———————————————
Ha! Do not worry about hurting me!
Lock on to me with [L] and swing
with [B]!
———————————————
Do not bother with any other
techniques for now.
———————————————
Lock on with [L] and attack with [B].
———————————————
Where is your lock-on?! Press [L]!
———————————————
Locking on with [L] is a fundamental
of combat. Without it, you are lost.
Now! Lock on to me with [L]
and attack with [B]!
———————————————
Yes, a fine sword arm, indeed.
———————————————
That was a vertical slash.
———————————————
While locked on with [L], you can
tilt [+][<] when you press [B] to
perform a horizontal slash.
———————————————
That was a horizontal slash.
———————————————
If you just press [B] while locked on
with [L], you will perform a
horizontal slash.
———————————————
Locking on with [L] will greatly ease
your path to victory.
———————————————
Now, let us see you stab.
Lock on to me again with [L] and tilt
[+][v] as you press [B].
———————————————
That is no stab! Lock on with [L]
and tilt [+][v] as you press [B]!
———————————————
Where is your lock-on?! Press [L]!
———————————————
Do not lose your nerve! Lock on to
me with [L] and tilt [+][v] as you
press [B] to stab!
———————————————
You have some skills...
———————————————
Now, perhaps we will move on to
something more grand.
———————————————
Aim for my head! Lock on with [L]
and press [A] to perform a
jump attack!
———————————————
Have at me! Lock on with [L] and
press [A] to perform a jump attack!
———————————————
Excellent! Let that maneuver
become second nature.
———————————————
And now for the last technique...
———————————————
When you are surrounded by foes,
and it seems all is lost, you must
fight for life! Hold down [B] for a
time and release for a spin attack!
———————————————
You must learn not to rush when
using the spin attack! Hold down
[B], then release!
———————————————
Now, perform a spin attack on me!
Hold down [B] for a time and
then release!
———————————————
Excellent. I have seen all I need...
———————————————
You are ready to make my hidden
skills your own.
———————————————
We meet again.
———————————————
You have a little more of the look of
a hero than you did before... Do you
feel ready to earn your next skill?
———————————————
[.]I do.
[.]I do not.
———————————————
In that case, return to your world
and train yourself further. When you
are prepared, come visit me again.
———————————————
Very well...
———————————————
But before we begin, I must test you
to ensure you have mastered the last
skill I taught you...the ending blow.
———————————————
Now then, come at me!
———————————————
Excellent. It appears you are
certainly capable of performing
my lost art.
———————————————
Very well. My second skill is...
———————————————
The shield attack! Let it be hewn into
your mind!
———————————————
Hidden Skill: Ending Blow
———————————————
Enemies that are filled with energy
will quickly recover and attack
again even when stunned by a
powerful strike.
———————————————
The ending blow is a secret
technique you can use on stunned
enemies to end their breath before
they spring back into action.
———————————————
When an enemy lies collapsed on
the ground, stunned, [L]-target and
press [A] to leap high into the
air and deliver a final strike.
———————————————
When the opportunity to end their
breath is before you, you will see
Finish [A] appear vividly before
your eyes.
———————————————
Now, try it on me!
———————————————
To stun an enemy and knock him
down, you must strike repeatedly
with powerful attacks.
———————————————
Powerful moves like the jump attack
and spin attack, or rapid and repeated
sword strikes are most effective.
———————————————
What ails you?! The most basic aspect
of swordplay is [L]-targeting! Do not
tell me you have forgotten that!
———————————————
What is the matter? Did not the
Finish [A] image appear before your
eyes?
———————————————
Coward... The moment the enemy
is felled, you must strike with [A]!
Try it again!
———————————————
Hmm. That was a pinpoint strike.
Never overlook your opportunity
to finish with [A]!
———————————————
The first hidden skill, the ending
blow, has been passed on!
———————————————
You learned the first hidden
skill, the ending blow!
When you fell a foe, lock on with
[L] and deliver a final blow with [A]!
———————————————
There are still six hidden skills
for you to learn.
———————————————
The path to becoming the true hero
is a long one, but once you have
grasped all of the hidden skills, you
shall be worthy of walking it.
———————————————
You must persist on the lonely path
of the sword to obtain true courage
and earn the strength to conquer
the great evils of the world!
———————————————
Do not forget your discipline with
the blade before we meet again!
———————————————
We meet again.
———————————————
It appears your efforts have begun
to return some vigor to Hyrule,
but it is far too early to relax.
———————————————
Do you feel ready to earn another
hidden skill to steel yourself
for the forthcoming battles against
more powerful foes?
———————————————
[.]I do.
[.]I do not.
———————————————
In that case, return to your world
and train yourself further. When you
are prepared, come visit me again.
———————————————
Very well...
———————————————
But before we begin, I must test you
to ensure you have mastered the last
skill I taught you, the shield attack.
———————————————
Now then, come at me!
———————————————
Excellent. It appears you are
certainly capable of performing
my lost art.
———————————————
Very well. My third hidden skill is...
———————————————
The back slice! Let it be hewn into
your mind!
———————————————
Hidden Skill: Back Slice
———————————————
A mere shield attack is no match
for an enemy protected not just by
a shield, but by a thick, full-body
coat of armor.
———————————————
Such enemies are often focused
on guarding against frequent
frontal attacks. They often leave
their rear unprotected.
———————————————
That is when you [L]-target and
press [A] while tilting [<][+][>] to jump
and roll around your foe, then
perform a jumping slice.
———————————————
This is the back slice! Now, try it!
———————————————
What ails you?
———————————————
First you must [L]-target the foe.
Then, while tilting [<][+][>], press [A]
to repeatedly jump left or right and
circle around your enemy!
———————————————
What ails you?! The most basic aspect
of swordplay is [L]-targeting! Do not
tell me you have forgotten that!
———————————————
Jump left or right to deftly circle
around your enemy, then swing
your blade while jumping!
———————————————
Your chance to jump and strike
comes immediately before you
completely circle around your
enemy! Remember this!
———————————————
Hmm... You carry yourself well.
But do not forget the proper timing
for swinging your sword while
you jump.
———————————————
The third hidden skill, the back slice,
has been passed on!
———————————————
You learned the third hidden skill,
the back slice! Circle around
heavily armored enemies to
strike their unguarded rears!
———————————————
There are still four hidden skills
for you to learn.
———————————————
Do not neglect your daily sword
training between now and the time
you come to learn the next skill!
———————————————
May we meet again.
———————————————
We meet again.
———————————————
At last, the skills I have to teach
you have entered the realm of
true secrecy. They are forgotten
ways that do not leave our bloodline.
———————————————
Among the techniques I shall be
teaching you are some that may
even endanger you... Do you feel
ready to learn these skills?
———————————————
[.]I do.
[.]I do not.
———————————————
In that case, return to your world
and train yourself further. When you
are prepared, come visit me again.
———————————————
Very well...
———————————————
But before we begin, I must test
you to ensure that you have
mastered the last skill I taught
you, the helm splitter.
———————————————
Now then, come at me!
———————————————
Excellent. It appears you are
certainly capable of performing
my lost art.
———————————————
Very well. My fifth hidden skill is...
———————————————
The mortal draw! Let it be hewn into
your mind!

———————————————
Hidden Skill: Mortal Draw
———————————————
The ways of the sword are known
to many creatures, and some have
strengthened their guards against
shield attacks and back slices.
———————————————
Should you encounter such a foe,
the mortal draw that I am about
to teach you is most effective.
———————————————
You must sheathe your sword and
cast aside the most basic of sword
skills, the [L]-target. You must wait
until your foe is upon you...
———————————————
Then, before the enemy can see
through your ruse, you must quickly
draw your blade with [A].
———————————————
There is no defense for this.
The mortal draw deals death.
———————————————
Very well. Now, try it!
———————————————
Await your enemy with sword
sheathed. When Draw [A] appears
vividly before your eyes, your chance
to strike has come.
———————————————
If you miscalculate the space between
you and your opponent, you will be
attacked instead.
———————————————
You cannot strike unforeseen unless
you sheathe your sword!
———————————————
This technique cannot be used when
the enemy can read your movements
because you are [L]-targeting.
———————————————
You must wait until your foe is
nearly upon you without [L]-targeting
to pierce the enemy unexpectedly!
———————————————
Hmm. That was a pointed strike.
But do not forget that this
technique leaves your life at risk.
———————————————
The fifth hidden skill, the mortal draw,
has been passed on!
———————————————
You learned the fifth hidden
skill, the mortal draw!
Sheathe your blade, await your foe
without [L]-targeting, and strike!
———————————————
There are still two hidden skills
for you to learn...
———————————————
Do not neglect your daily sword
training between now and the time
you come to learn the next!
———————————————
May we meet again.
———————————————
We meet again.
———————————————
This next is the greatest of the
hidden skills I have taught you
to this point, and it may test the
limits of your endurance...
———————————————
Do you still wish to master it?
———————————————
[.]I do.
[.]I do not.
———————————————
In that case, return to your world
and train yourself further. When you
are prepared, come visit me again.
———————————————
Very well...
———————————————
But before we begin, I must test
you to ensure you have mastered
the last skill I taught you, the
back slice.
———————————————
Now then, come at me!
———————————————
Excellent. It appears you are
certainly capable of performing
my lost art.
———————————————
Very well. My fourth hidden skill is...
———————————————
The helm splitter! Let it be hewn into
your mind!
———————————————
Hidden Skill: Helm Splitter
———————————————
It is impossible to circle around
and perform a back slice against
fully armored enemies that move
swiftly in combat.
———————————————
Against such foes, you must first
use a shield attack to make them
flinch, but then quickly press [A]...
———————————————
You will leap into the air over the
enemy's head and greet them with
your blade by immediately striking
from behind.
———————————————
This is the helm splitter! Show it to
me!
———————————————
As soon as you make your enemy
flinch with a shield attack,
immediately strike with [A].
———————————————
Try it again! Start with the shield
attack!
———————————————
What ails you?! First you must make
me flinch with a shield attack!
———————————————
What ails you? Have you forgotten
[L]-targeting, the most basic of
sword techniques? First you must
hit with a shield attack!
———————————————
Hmm. Impressive.
———————————————
Do not miss your chance to land a
helm splitter with [A] after your shield
attack!
———————————————
The fourth hidden skill, the helm
splitter, has been passed on!
———————————————
You've learned the fourth hidden
skill, the helm splitter!
Stun foes with a shield attack,
then press [A] to attack from above!
———————————————
There are still three hidden skills
for you to learn.
———————————————
Do not neglect your daily sword
training between now and the time
you come to learn the next skill!
———————————————
May we meet again.
———————————————
Even if you land the helm splitter,
you cannot cause great damage unless
you also then attack from the rear!
———————————————
Now, try it once more from the
beginning!
———————————————
We meet again.
———————————————
...There are but a few hidden skills
left for me to teach you.
———————————————
I have warned you of this before,
but if you fail to execute the
hidden skill I am about to teach
you, your life may be forfeit...
———————————————
Do you still wish to master this
skill?
———————————————
[.]I do.
[.]I do not.
———————————————
In that case, return to your world
and train yourself further. When you
are prepared, come visit me again.
———————————————
Very well...
———————————————
But before we begin, I must test
you to ensure you have mastered
the last secret I taught you, the
mortal draw.
———————————————
Now then, come at me!
———————————————
Excellent. It appears you are
certainly capable of performing
my lost art.
———————————————
Very well. My sixth hidden skill is...
———————————————
The jump strike! Let it be hewn into
your mind!
———————————————
Hidden Skill: Jump Strike
———————————————
One of the basic sword techniques
is the jump attack. It inflicts great
damage, but none would call it
effective against multiple foes.
———————————————
To perform the jump strike, prepare
a jump attack, but focus power in your
blade. The surge the blade releases
can strike all enemies around you.
———————————————
This is the jump strike!
———————————————
Lock on with [L], then press and hold
[A]. Wait for just the right time to
release your strength!
———————————————
You cannot defend while you are
storing power.
———————————————
Carefully consider the distance of your
enemies, and then focus your power
with [A]. Then release it!
———————————————
What ails you?! You must lock on with
[L] then press and hold [A] to focus
power in your blade!
———————————————
What has happened to your basic 
sword skills? You cannot execute
this technique properly unless you
are [L]-targeting!
———————————————
Hmm. Impressive.
———————————————
Do not forget the timing for
releasing the power you just felt!
———————————————
The sixth hidden skill, the jump
strike, has been passed on!
———————————————
You learned the sixth hidden
skill, the jump strike! While
[L]-targeting, press and hold
[A] to focus, then release!
———————————————
There is but one hidden skill left
for me to pass on to you.
———————————————
You are already endowed with the
strength required of the hero.
———————————————
Do you not already feel the courage
granted by this strength as it guides
you step by step toward your true
enemy?
———————————————
Believe in your strength. Continue to
push forward unflinchingly, and
without straying from your path.
———————————————
May we meet again!
———————————————
At last...the time is now.
———————————————
This is the seventh and final hidden
skill that I can pass on to you.
———————————————
This forgotten skill is the ultimate
secret technique, and it tests the
true courage of the one who
wields it.
———————————————
Do you wish to master this final
hidden skill, which can be earned
only by the one true hero?
———————————————
[.]I do.
[.]I do not.
———————————————
If you have not the courage to
tread upon the path of the one
true hero, then begone.
———————————————
Farewell...
———————————————
Very well.
———————————————
Then before we begin...I will test
you to ensure you have mastered
the last skill I taught you, the
jump strike.
———————————————
Now then, come at me!
———————————————
Excellent. It appears you are
certainly capable of performing
my lost art.
———————————————
Very well. My final hidden skill is...
———————————————
The great spin! Let it be hewn into
your mind!
———————————————
Final Skill: Great Spin
———————————————
You have at your disposal the basic
sword technique known as the
spin attack.
———————————————
You have mastered numerous
hidden skills and now house the
spirit of the true hero.

You now have in you the ability to
magnify the power of your spin
attack.
———————————————
But the only time you can draw
out that power is when your life
energy is brimming full.
———————————————
Now, try unleashing this spin
attack on me.
———————————————
What ails you?
———————————————
Quickly now! Press and hold [B] for a
while before releasing, or rotate [o]
once and press [B] to show me your
spin attack!
———————————————
What ails you?
———————————————
You may be able to perform a spin
attack easily, but if you wish to
perform the great spin, do
not forget your [L]-targeting.
———————————————
Impressive...
———————————————
I will repeat this once more: you
can only perform this technique
when your life energy is brimming
full. Remember this.
———————————————
The final hidden skill, the great spin,
has been passed on!
———————————————
You learned the final hidden
skill, the great spin! With full
life energy, unleash a spin attack
for even more damage.
———————————————
You have at last mastered all of
the hidden skills.
———————————————
Although I accepted life as the
hero, I could not convey the lessons
of that life to those who came after.
At last, I have eased my regrets.
———————————————
You who have marched through
countless foes, each mightier than
the last... You, who now gaze to
the future with vision unclouded...
———————————————
Surely you can restore Hyrule to
its stature of yore as the chosen
land of the gods.
———————————————
...Farewell!
———————————————
Go and do not falter, my child!
———————————————
But the hidden skill I am about to
teach is a defensive maneuver...
———————————————
First, you must obtain a shield.
Visit me once you have done so.
———————————————
What ails you? Right after the
helm splitter is the perfect time for
subsequent attacks!
———————————————
If you get behind an enemy, do not
hesitate to attack!
———————————————
HEEEEELP! Lemme out of here, please!
———————————————
Hey, [Link], c'mon! PLEASE!
Help me! Set me free!
———————————————
They're still here! Hurry! Chase 'em
away!
———————————————
If you hadn't come, [Link]...
Gee, me and that monkey would've
gotten eaten, probably!
———————————————
She's actually a pretty nice gal, that
monkey... She tried to protect me, so
we got captured together.
———————————————
Um, [Link]...
———————————————
You're not gonna mention this to
my dad, are you?
———————————————
He's always telling me to never, EVER
go into the forest, 'cause he says
it's dangerous...
———————————————
So you really can't tell him! Really!
You have to promise!
———————————————
[Link]!
———————————————
My son told me Talo disappeared
into the woods and had not returned.
I came as soon as I heard...
———————————————
But it looks like you have brought
him home already... I apologize.
Such a task should not fall to you.
———————————————
Tell me, have you noticed how strange
this wood seems lately? I feel...
uneasy about what may lie in wait...
———————————————
Anyway, [Link]...
———————————————
Tomorrow is finally the day. You will
be departing for Hyrule.
———————————————
I think it is a good thing I have given
this task to you...
———————————————
Good luck! And return safely!
———————————————
If you are lucky, you may even get
to meet Princess Zelda! Ah ha ha!
———————————————
Well done, adventurer!
———————————————
Ooccoo sees what she was looking
for.
———————————————
Goodness, yes! It's the Dominion Rod
you found in the temple!
———————————————
But that thing has been around for
quite some time. I can see from here
that its magic has been exhausted.
———————————————
Ooh, what am I to... I thought at last
I could return to the sky...
———————————————
And I have completely forgotten
the spell that would once again
bestow it with magic...
———————————————
It can't be helped. I suppose I'll
just have to look for the statues
that respond to the rod...
———————————————
It's decided! That's what we'll do!
That's what we'll do, indeed!
———————————————
Well, Ooccoo is on her way!
See you again!
———————————————
Hey! Wait! What did you do to the
Dominion Rod?
———————————————
...She's gone.
———————————————
I suppose a useless rod is really
just more baggage, but...what are
you going to do?
———————————————
Hmm... Did she just say something
about returning to the sky?
———————————————
The last piece of the mirror is also
said to be in the heavens...
———————————————
If we can restore magic to the
Dominion Rod, maybe it'll come in
handy!
———————————————
Those stupid monsters... They think
they can just do whatever they want
in our town! We won't allow it!
———————————————
Hey there, buddy! Lemme tell you
something good.
———————————————
See, these guys tend to hide hearts
and Rupees all around these parts.
———————————————
If you want some of that nice loot, just
dig around to your heart's content!
———————————————
The stuff hidden around here is all
stolen monster loot.
———————————————
If you want some of that nice loot, just
dig around to your heart's content!
———————————————
Don't worry... You have my blessing!
———————————————
Do something fun with us! Ask the
Cucco leader about it!
———————————————
Meow meow! We should play again!
The Cucco leader is waiting!
———————————————
Come play again, meow!
———————————————
Do something fun with us! Ask the
Cucco leader about it!
———————————————
Meow meow! We should play again!
The Cucco leader is waiting!
———————————————
Come play again, meow!
———————————————
Oh... Welcome... This is the forgotten
village...
———————————————
Hello there... You're safe and sound...
———————————————
30... No, more like 20...
———————————————
That's how many cats have made it
back here to the village...
———————————————
So perhaps you could...you know...
just...play with them?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
Aww, thanks so much... They're all so
lonely... Perhaps you could talk to
every one of them?
———————————————
...But if you leave the village, it will be
like you never talked to any of them,
do you understand? Cats are forgetful.
———————————————
Oh, and let me give you a tip for
speaking to all of them... Start at one
end!
———————————————
Got it?
———————————————
I see... Well, I can't force you...
———————————————
But... If you change your mind, please
do come back.
———————————————
Because I have something nice to
thank you with if you do it!
———————————————
Thanks... We're counting on you for
next time.
———————————————
Once you've spoken to all of them,
come back to me again...
———————————————
Hello...
———————————————
So... You think you're ready to try that
thing I was telling you about?
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!

Meow! What fun, meow!

Meow! What fun, meow!

Meow! What fun, meow!

Meow! What fun, meow!

Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!

Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
Meow! What fun, meow!
———————————————
First one, meow!
———————————————
Second one, mrow!
———————————————
Third one, meeew!
———————————————
Fourth one, meeerow!
———————————————
Fifth one, meow!
———————————————
Sixth one, meow-meow!
———————————————
Seventh one, mrow!
———————————————
Eighth one, mew!
———————————————
Ninth one, meeeyow!
———————————————
Tenth one, meeerow!
———————————————
Eleventh one, mrowr!
———————————————
Twelfth one, meow!
———————————————
Thirteenth one, meeeow!
———————————————
Fourteenth one, meerow!
———————————————
Fifteenth one, mrow!
———————————————
Sixteenth one, meow!
———————————————
Seventeenth one, meowrr!
———————————————
Eighteenth one, meeerow!
———————————————
Nineteenth one, meow!
———————————————
Twentieth one, MEOW!
———————————————
Wow-meow! Everyone is getting along,
meow!
———————————————
Go tell the Cucco leader!
———————————————
You already talked to me, meow!
———————————————
We've already spoken, meerow!
———————————————
We're already buddies, meow-meow!
———————————————
...You know what to do, right?
We're counting on you!
———————————————
This is such a big help... These cats
are just so lonely... I really appreciate
it, seriously...
———————————————
Just don't disappear before you're
done, OK?
———————————————
You talked to all of them! Thanks...
———————————————
Now, your prize is in front of the old
lady's house...
———————————————
Make sure you pick it up before you
leave...
———————————————
And thanks for everything...
———————————————
I think the monsters left it here...
It's a pretty red stone, so make sure
you get it...
———————————————
Your prize is in front of the old lady's
house...
———————————————
If you want your prize, it's buried in
front of the old lady's house...
———————————————
Eee hee! I knew it!
———————————————
From the look of it, I don't think we're
going to get through here too easily...
———————————————
So... What now?
———————————————
Wait! Wait! Don't go too far!
———————————————
You still have stuff to do here in these
woods, don't you? Come back!
———————————————
Hey! Haven't you seen that monkey
before? Go on, hero! Rescue her!
———————————————
Hey... Think we can get across
over here?
———————————————
Hey, aren't you forgetting something?
———————————————
Hey! Hey! HEY! What are you
thinking? Don't you DARE ignore me!
———————————————
You're forgetting the lantern!
———————————————
Hey! Just where do you think you're
going?
———————————————
We still have an important errand at
the temple deep in the woods.
———————————————
Don't bother... Getting out of an area
covered in twilight isn't so easy...
[sfx]Eee hee hee!
———————————————
If you're homesick for your world of
light, then hurry up and help the spirit
of the forest!
———————————————
The sacred, ancient forest... So this
was what they were talking about...
———————————————
So there's another section of forest
beyond this cliff.
———————————————
All right, [Link], let's go!
———————————————
What the...
———————————————
No matter how many times you
defeat these things, they keep coming
back, [Link]! 
———————————————
We ought to lay down a field of dark
energy and beat them all at once!
———————————————
Hey, it's that monkey again... Why
don't we try to help her out?
———————————————
These must be the things that were
after the monkey... Could this all be
the work of that little guy with the
horn?
———————————————
I don't know my way around here too
well, so try not to get lost.
———————————————
Ugh! Quick little guy, isn't he?
———————————————
But hey, he's not trying to run away at
all, is he? He's...trying to lead us
somewhere!
———————————————
Why, that little... He likes to joke
around, huh?
———————————————
Let's get him while he's entranced
by that horn!
———————————————
Now, see... That's what I was warning
you about.
———————————————
I'm telling you, I don't think we're
going to get through here too easily.
———————————————
So... What'll we do?
———————————————
There! Let's cross over there!
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
[.]Refuel lantern
[.]Fill bottle
[.]Never mind
———————————————
Look there...You saw one of those
in the basement of the castle, right?
Use your senses with [+v]!
———————————————
You probably already know this, but...
swing [W] to wield your sword and 
use [Z] to defend with your shield.
———————————————
You just hold down [B] and I'll expand
an energy field. Enclose all of your
enemies within it and release the
button!
———————————————
Press and hold [B] and I'll put up a
dark energy field... You trap all of
these guys inside of it and then
release the button!
———————————————
Now, if you're a good little boy,
I'll let you summon me to lead you
places again. Just go to the Map
screen with  [1]  and press [Z].
———————————————
Leave these woods and go to the
west, where you will find the land
protected by the spirit Eldin.
———————————————
Leave these woods and go to the
west, where you will find the land
protected by the spirit Eldin.
———————————————
Leave these woods and go to the
west, to the land of Eldin.
———————————————
Hero chosen by the gods, leave these
woods and go west, to the land
of the spirit Eldin.
———————————————
[>] Forest Temple Path

It's pitch-dark ahead! Parties
interested in going forward
must first go this way! [<]
                        Coro
———————————————
[ 8C]Lantern Oil Refill    20 Rupees

The woods are dangerous at
night! Don't run out of lamp oil!
Dip an empty bottle with [B],
or just stick your lantern in.
———————————————
Red Potion[ 8C] Refill   30 Rupees

This blend of mushrooms and
herbs replenishes life energy.
Dip an empty bottle with [B].
———————————————
On the ["-"] Items screen, set the lantern
to [B] and then use [B] to swing it!
———————————————
First, you wanna press [B] to take out
your lantern, then press [+] where
your oil is set to refill it!
———————————————
When facing such a foe, you must
lock on with [Z] and thrust the
Nunchuk forward to thrust your shield
against the defenses of your enemy.
———————————————
Use [Z] to lock on to me, then try it!
You have learned much, so I am sure
you will know the moment when
you can do a shield attack!
———————————————
What ails you? You cannot shield-
attack unless you lock on with [Z] first!
———————————————
Get closer to your foe, lock on with
[Z], and thrust the Nunchuk to do a
shield attack!
———————————————
After you shield-attack and send your
foe reeling, attack with your sword
immediately!
———————————————
Would you practice? Then repel
my magical attack with your shield
attack!
———————————————
You must time it just as my spell hits
your shield to reflect it back at me.
———————————————
You must lock on with [Z]! This is a
fundamental of combat!
———————————————
You learned the second hidden
skill, shield attack! Lock on to a
foe with [Z] and thrust the Nunchuk
forward to thrust your shield!
———————————————
First, the basics. Lock on with [Z]
and show me how you slice with
that sword.
———————————————
Ha! Do not worry about hurting me!
Lock on to me with [Z] and swing
with [W]!
———————————————
Lock on with [Z] and attack with [W].
———————————————
Where is your lock-on?! Press [Z]!
———————————————
Locking on with [Z] is a fundamental
of combat. Without it, you are lost.
Now! Lock on to me with [Z]
and attack with [W]!
———————————————
While locked on with [Z], you can
tilt [+] or [<] when you swing [W] to
perform a horizontal slash.
———————————————
If you just swing [W] while locked on
with [Z], you will perform a
horizontal slash.
———————————————
Locking on with [Z] will greatly ease
your path to victory.
———————————————
Now, let us see you stab.
Lock on to me again with [Z] and stab
[W] forward while tilting [+][v].
———————————————
That is no stab! Lock on with [Z]
and tilt [+][v] as you stab [W]
forward!
———————————————
Where is your lock-on?! Press [Z]!
———————————————
Do not lose your nerve! Lock on to
me with [Z] and tilt [+][v] as you
stab [W] forward!
———————————————
Aim for my head! Lock on with [Z]
and press [A] to perform a
jump attack!
———————————————
Have at me! Lock on with [Z] and
press [A] to perform a jump attack!
———————————————
When you are surrounded by foes,
and it seems all is lost, you must
fight for life! Rotate [W] in the direction
you want to swing your sword.
———————————————
You must learn not to rush when
using the spin attack! Rotate [W] in
the direction you want to swing
your sword.
———————————————
Now, perform a spin attack on me!
Quickly rotate [W] in the direction
you want to swing your sword.
———————————————
When an enemy lies collapsed on
the ground, stunned, [Z]-target and
press [A] without delay to leap high
into the air and deliver a final strike.
———————————————
When the opportunity to end their
breath is before you, you will see
Finish [A] appear vividly before
your eyes.
———————————————
What ails you?! The most basic aspect
of swordplay is [Z]-targeting! Do not
tell me you have forgotten that!
———————————————
What is the matter? Did not the
Finish [A] image appear before your
eyes?
———————————————
Coward... The moment the enemy
is felled, you must lock on and strike
with [A]! Try it again!
———————————————
Hmm. That was a pinpoint strike.
Never overlook your opportunity
to finish with [A]!
———————————————
You learned the first hidden
skill, the ending blow!
When a foe falls, lock on with [Z]
and deliver a final blow with [A]!
———————————————
That is when you [Z]-target and
press [A] while tilting [<][+][>] to jump
and roll around your foe, then
perform a jumping slice.
———————————————
First you must [Z]-target the foe.
Then, while tilting [<][+][>], press [A]
to repeatedly jump left or right and
circle around your enemy!
———————————————
What ails you?! The most basic aspect
of swordplay is [Z]-targeting! Do not
tell me you have forgotten that!
———————————————
You must sheathe your sword and
cast aside the most basic of sword
skills, the [Z]-target. You must wait
until your foe is upon you...
———————————————
Then, before the enemy can see
through your ruse, you must quickly
draw your blade with [A].
———————————————
Await your enemy with sword
sheathed. When Draw [A] appears
vividly before your eyes, your chance
to strike has come.
———————————————
This technique cannot be used when
the enemy can read your movements
because you are [Z]-targeting.
———————————————
You must wait until your foe is
nearly upon you without [Z]-targeting
to pierce the enemy unexpectedly!
———————————————
You learned the fifth hidden
skill, the mortal draw!
Sheathe the blade, await your foe
without [Z]-targeting, and strike!
———————————————
Against such foes, you must first
use a shield attack to make them
flinch, but then quickly press [A]...
———————————————
As soon as you make your enemy
flinch with a shield attack,
immediately strike with [A].
———————————————
What ails you? Have you forgotten
[Z]-targeting, the most basic of
sword techniques? First you must
hit with a shield attack!
———————————————
Do not miss your chance to land a
helm splitter with [A] after your shield
attack!
———————————————
You've learned the fourth hidden
skill, the helm splitter!
Stun foes with a shield attack,
then press [A] to chop from above!
———————————————
Lock on with [Z] then press and hold
[A] until just the right time to release
your strength!
———————————————
You cannot defend while you are
storing power.
———————————————
Once you have clearly grasped the
timing of your enemies' strikes,
lock on with [Z] and focus your power
with [A]. Then release it!
———————————————
What ails you?! You must lock on with
[Z] then press and hold [A] to focus
power in your blade!
———————————————
What has happened to your basic 
sword skills? You cannot execute
this technique properly unless you
are [Z]-targeting!
———————————————
You learned the sixth hidden
skill, the jump strike! While
[Z]-targeting, press and hold
[A] to focus, then release!
———————————————
Lightly shake the Nunchuk side
to side.
———————————————
You may be able to perform a spin
attack easily, but if you wish to
perform the great spin, do
not forget your [Z]-targeting.
———————————————
You learned the final hidden
skill, the great spin! With full
life energy, unleash a spin attack
for extra damage.
———————————————
DAT1
———————————————
Î
———————————————
Wait!
———————————————
Please, you must allow me to thank
you for revitalizing both my people
and this spring, which is the water
source for all the lands of Hyrule.
———————————————
In life, I was the elder of this Zora
village and the queen of my people.
I was called Rutela.
———————————————
Not to be rude, but we didn't
exactly do it for you guys...
———————————————
The dark ones... They raided this
village and, as a message to my 
people, executed me before them.
———————————————
Young man... You who take the
form of a proud beast...
———————————————
I have something to ask of you.
———————————————
When the dark ones descended
upon our village, I sent my young
one, Ralis, to Hyrule Castle to
inform Princess Zelda of our fate.
———————————————
But...I fear danger followed him
from this doomed place.
———————————————
I feel it. His presence grows fainter
to me over time...
———————————————
But my time in this world has
passed, and though I would give it
gladly, I no longer have a life to
risk in his rescue.
———————————————
Please... Would you save my
dearest, Prince Ralis?
———————————————
If you do this thing, I will bestow
upon you the protection of water.
———————————————
This power will grant you the ability
to swim and respire in very deep
water as if you were a Zora.
———————————————
Please... Save my son...
———————————————
Hmm... So, if we help her, she'll
grant you the power to swim in
deep water like a Zora, huh?
———————————————
So... What do you say, Hero?
———————————————
...Oh, but now that I think about it,
I don't suppose you should meet
the prince as a wolf, huh? [sfx]Eee hee!
———————————————
So... No hurry to return you to the
world of light, then, huh?
———————————————
Wow... The water in the Zoras'
spring returned to normal just like
that?
———————————————
Perfect! Let's forget about these
guys and look for that spirit!
———————————————
A portal has opened here, too!
We can finally warp.
———————————————
If you want to breathe the air of
the world of light for a moment, let
me know. I'll take you there!
———————————————
Who knew that something so
dangerous would come in handy...
———————————————
All right... The Zoras are safe now,
so let's go.
———————————————
The ice melted and restored the
water flow to normal. Can we finally
meet the spirit of Lake Hylia?
———————————————
Hahh... Hah...
———————————————
H-Hey... Are you OK?
———————————————
A-Ahh... What about those in the
waterfall pool?
———————————————
So, what do you think? Is it not a
splendid waterfall? This one is the
largest in our domain.
———————————————
And this waterfall flows directly
from the throne room.
———————————————
If you would like, I can take you
there.
———————————————
[.]Yes, let's go.
[.]No, thank you.
———————————————
OK, then...
———————————————
We welcome the visit of one
connected with the royal family.
———————————————
If at any time you need to visit the
throne room, just let me know.
———————————————
This waterfall flows directly
from the throne room.
———————————————
Hey, the beast of Snowpeak... 
Oh! The red fish it's holding!
That's a reekfish!
———————————————
Ah... So the beast has been
showing itself because it's been
catching reekfish...
———————————————
Not only is that type of fish
tenacious, but it won't even bat an
eye at ordinary bait.
———————————————
In fact, this is the first time we'd
seen anyone other than Prince
Ralis catch one. We were stunned!
———————————————
We didn't think that anyone
besides Prince Ralis was capable of
catching this type of fish!
———————————————
The fish this beast has...
———————————————
Prince Ralis is quite skilled at
catching that type of fish...
———————————————
Oh... Prince... Where could you
be by now...
———————————————
When I see this fish, I can't help
but think of the prince...
———————————————
Prince... Where could you be by
now...
———————————————
This... Did you draw this?
———————————————
The beast... Hey! Isn't it holding a 
red fish?
———————————————
That's a reekfish!
———————————————
Reekfish live close to the two stone
formations we call the Mother-and-
Child Rocks.
———————————————
They've got a distinct smell that
some find a little...gamey...but
they're packed with nutrients, so
they're revered and well cared for.
———————————————
Uhh, was I unconscious?
———————————————
Our queen was beautiful and proud.
———————————————
I would've dearly loved to
introduce you to her, traveler, but
that's no longer possible...
———————————————
Our queen died a tragic death, but
I have not seen the prince weep
for her.
———————————————
Seeing his resolve makes me
realize that we shouldn't mourn her
forever. She would have wanted us
to move on.
———————————————
.....................
———————————————
Sniff... My queen...
———————————————
We were all so close to our
queen... Guarding her empty throne
is almost more than I can bear...
———————————————
But still, until our prince returns,
it is our duty to watch over this
room.
———————————————
You saved our young prince?!
———————————————
Oh, let me thank you on behalf of
all the Zora people! This is a great
day indeed!
———————————————
Those demons...
———————————————
If we fracture our troop strength
with too many parties searching for
the prince, our guard here will be
too thin... Hmm...
———————————————
Normally we'd extend the warmest
of welcomes to a traveler like
yourself...
———————————————
We have greatly anticipated your
return.
———————————————
What in the world happened?
———————————————
Prince Ralis is so young... To think
the queen... Ugh...
———————————————
The throne room status is currently
at normal!
———————————————
............
———————————————
Attacks by the shadow beasts...
Volcanic boulders in the throne
room... What in the world is going
on?!
———————————————
We Zoras can't survive without a
moist environment.
———————————————
Our poor prince... If only he hadn't
collapsed underneath that
withering sun...
———————————————
Oh, if only our dear queen could
have seen young Prince Ralis as
he is now...
———————————————
Huhhh... Haaaahhh...
———————————————
Well, the water is at least flowing
again, but it's a little vigorous...
———————————————
We still need to check to see if the
places that take their water from
here have been affected...
———————————————
We suffered a mortal loss when the
dark ones raided us.
———————————————
It was our cowardice that cost us
our queen...
———————————————
Now that the young prince has
returned, I can see our people
beginning to pick themselves up
again...
———————————————
Now's the time to strengthen our
resolve...
———————————————
Someone...helped me?
———————————————
It would be nice if the search
parties for the prince would
make it back safely...
———————————————
This is the Zora village. It's both
our ancestral home and the source
of Hyrule's water.
———————————————
...............
———————————————
Our young prince...has grown into
a fine Zora...
———————————————
I wonder, are the downstream areas
going to be all right?
———————————————
Not... Not our prince, too!
———————————————
No... It's better not to even think
such unlucky thoughts...
———————————————
If you follow the flow of water
southward, you'll catch sight of 
Hyrule Castle.
———————————————
...Still, it's a long journey, even for
the long legs of an adult...
———————————————
It appears that the cave to
Snowpeak is still frozen over...
I suppose we'll have to wait a bit
longer.
———————————————
Up ahead is Snowpeak, a mountain
engulfed by an endless blizzard.
———————————————
The prince instructed me to let you
pass. Please be careful.
———————————————
Koh... Koff!
———————————————
Where has our young prince gone?
———————————————
............
———————————————
If you have business in the throne
room, then please speak to the
attendant at the base of the
waterfall.
———————————————
Have you already spoken to the
Zoras swimming in the waterfall
pool?
———————————————
[.]Yes, I have.
[.]Not yet.
———————————————
Well... I guess it'd be tough to
meet a lot of Zoras if you didn't
know how to swim freely in the
water.
———————————————
The prince awaits you. The
attendant at the base of the
waterfall can take you to the throne
room, so please go to him quickly!
———————————————
The prince is the light and hope of
our people... We thank you from
the bottom of our hearts for saving
him!
———————————————
Now that the king and queen have
passed on...do we call our prince
the new king?
———————————————
Hafff... Huffff......
———————————————
Excuse me, traveler... Did you just
come from town, by any chance?
———————————————
Have you seen Prince Ralis... 
I mean, have you seen a Zora boy
as you were traveling?
———————————————
Traveler, did you see a Zora boy
when you were in town?
———————————————
All of us in the village are so happy
that our young prince is back!
———————————————
Hahh... Haffff...
———————————————
I feel like that rock is looking at
me... Am I getting water crazy?
———————————————
When you look at that rock, don't
you...sense something strange?
———————————————
Like, I don't know... Like...it's
looking at you or something.
———————————————
There was a Goron hiding inside?!
Whoa!
———————————————
What a strong life force these
Gorons have! You've got to
respect it. It's hard to stay angry
at them for long...
———————————————
That Goron... What's he up to?
———————————————
Uhhh...
———————————————
The dark ones raided this village,
yes, but I heard they also sent a
second force to the Lakebed
Temple at the bottom of Lake Hylia.
———————————————
I know we should try to find a way
to drive them out of the temple, but
we're too preoccupied with finding
the prince...
———————————————
When the dark ones invaded the
Lakebed Temple at the bottom of 
Lake Hylia, some of our soldiers
were trapped inside.
———————————————
I'm sure they fought bravely...but
they couldn't have lasted long.
———————————————
Our former king was a great Zora,
but young Prince Ralis shows a lot
of promise, as well.
———————————————
Hahhh... Haffff...
———————————————
I survived thanks to that volcanic
rock... I don't know what I would've
done without it!
———————————————
As soon as peace returns to the
world, we'll hold a banquet for the
coronation of young Prince Ralis.
———————————————
What's with that rock?
———————————————
Did you see the boulder that sank
to the bottom of the water?
———————————————
It looked like it was some sort of
volcanic rock...but then, where did
it fall from?
———————————————
I heard that the darkness devouring
the temple was driven out by a
hero dressed in blue.
———————————————
...Wait, was that you?!
———————————————
A Goron came out of the volcanic
rock... So that means it came all
the way from Death Mountain,
right?
———————————————
As you can see from that empty
throne, we've lost our village's
leader, and now I fear our people
are in danger of losing their way.
———————————————
Now when I think of what might
have happened to the prince,
I feel so...
———————————————
Some humongous guy made a weird
face at me and went through here.
———————————————
And he was carrying a fish!
What was THAT all about?
———————————————
I heard that the mountain beast 
has been frequenting our village
lately.
———————————————
The beast never came to the village
before. I wonder what brings him...
———————————————
There seems to be no end to the
mayhem that's befallen us since
our queen passed on...
———————————————
Things have been in such an uproar
lately... I'm on patrol in an attempt
to beef up security in our domain.
———————————————
It is our responsibility to protect
this village as we await Prince
Ralis's return.
———————————————
The weather is bad, and travel is
treacherous. If you head out
without a marked path, you might
not make it out alive.
———————————————
Apparently, the beast of Snowpeak
mountain has been appearing in
this town frequently of late.
———————————————
Why the beast who normally lives
on Snowpeak would come down to
the village... Well, we don't have a
clue as to why this would be.
———————————————
Snowpeak is up ahead. It's very
treacherous.
———————————————
Not only has the weather been bad
lately, but because the beast has 
been coming to the village, we have
been taking extra precautions.
———————————————
There's a rumor going around that
a suspicious person has been seen
around here lately.
———————————————
I wonder if those in the throne
room have been informed of this...
———————————————
For some reason, a suspicious
person has been wandering around
our domain lately.
———————————————
I didn't see him...but there were
some witnesses near the waterfall
basin, I think.
———————————————
Have you heard?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
You've got good ears. I only just
learned of it myself...
———————————————
Apparently, the beast of the snowy
mountains came here. At least,
that's what some folks who saw him
are claiming...
———————————————
A suspicious girl has been seen
around this area lately... I wonder
what brings her?
———————————————
Going to the Death Mountain hot
spring is pretty popular among our
people right now...
———————————————
I'm jealous... I have to stay here
and guard the village. I don't get to
go anywhere...
———————————————
[Link]! You came!
———————————————
Thanks to you, I made it home at
last.
———————————————
I think all of us carry heavy hearts,
but I will do my best to see that
our village's wounds heal as
quickly as possible.
———————————————
Come see us anytime,
[Link]. You will always be
welcome here.
———————————————
Well, we aren't accustomed to
hosting humans, but please make
yourself at home.
———————————————
Now, this is made out to a
"Mr. Zora," so I don't really know
who ought to receive it...
———————————————
I am finally out! Thanks, Brother!
———————————————
I took a nap and found myself
swallowed up in lava...and
somehow very far from home!
———————————————
Say, Brother, do not swim off.
I have not had a chance to thank
you yet.
———————————————
Hot springs are nice, but this place
is pretty good, too!
———————————————
Say, where am I anyway, Brother?
This place is a little cold for a hot
spring...
———————————————
But hey, this is nice and cool!
I like it! It is a COLD spring!
———————————————
Hey, Brother, do not swim off.
I have not had a chance to thank
you yet.
———————————————
Uh, yes... Well, let me give you a
token of my appreciation, Brother!
———————————————
This is all I have on me right now.
I hope it will do!
———————————————
Here, take this with my thanks,
Brother!
———————————————
Say, Brother, did you just break
that rock for me? Thanks!
———————————————
I think we can get up from here...
Let's go...
———————————————
It's slippery, though... Don't fall!
———————————————
Hey...
———————————————
Hey! We can climb up from here!
———————————————
Whoa! Hey!
———————————————
Down! Look below the ice!
———————————————
Those... Those are the Zoras!
———————————————
Wow... This is really strange...
What in the world happened?
———————————————
Hey... What do you want to do?
We can't just leave them like this...
———————————————
I think all we need to do is thaw
them out...
———————————————
It does us no good to just stand 
here thinking... Let's leave and
come back later.
———————————————
The portal should work for us. We
need to find a way to melt the ice
and then come back here...
———————————————
Thanks for coming to visit!
———————————————
I'm Hena, and this is my fishing
hole. Nice to meet ya!
———————————————
Here you can ride in a canoe for
lure fishing or stand on the shore
and try bobber fishing.
Which'll it be?
———————————————
[.]Lure fishing
[.]Bobber fishing
———————————————
OK! Let's hop in the canoe!
———————————————
OK! Let's get to fishing!
———————————————
What are you thinking? Don't ask
me stuff! Ask Ms. Fishing Queen
here!
———————————————
Hey, congrats! You caught one!
This is a Hyrule bass. They're
pretty common around here.
———————————————
Sizewise, I'd say it's about
[var], maybe? Go ahead and
press [A] to release this one so you
can keep fishing.
———————————————
Sizewise, I'd say it's about
[var], maybe? Go ahead and
press [A] to release this one so you
can keep fishing.
———————————————
Ooh! It's another Hyrule bass!
———————————————
I guess it's about [var].
That's a pretty average size, if
you're wondering. ...OK! Press [A]
to release it!
———————————————
That looks to be about [var].
Yeah, that's pretty much average.
...OK. Press [A] to release it!
———————————————
That's HUGE!
———————————————
That looks to be almost [var]...
But there are even bigger ones out
there! ...OK! Press [A] to release it.
———————————————
Ooh! You caught one! This fish is a
Hylian pike. It's pretty sought after
by fishing fanatics these days!
———————————————
I'd say that's about [var].
...But you can't keep it today, so
press [A] to release it.
———————————————
It looks like it's almost [var].
...But you can't keep it today, so
press [A] to release it.
———————————————
Amazing... Another Hylian pike!
———————————————
...Do you fish professionally?
———————————————
NO WAY!
———————————————
Wow... It's the legendary...Hylian
loach! Even I didn't know there
were any of those in here!
———————————————
WOW!
———————————————
Unbelievable. Another Hylian
loach... Who... What ARE you?!
Are you some kind of fishing
legend?
———————————————
Oh, dearie me... An Ordon catfish...
Those aren't popular at all...
———————————————
They look cute and all, but they're
a little too slimy...
———————————————
That one looks to be about
[var]... Hurry up and press [A]
to throw the thing back!
———————————————
That one looks to be about
[var]... Now hurry up and press
[A] to throw that thing back!
———————————————
Eww... Not another catfish...
———————————————
Uh, I guess it's about [var]?
OK! Press [A] to release it! Quick!
———————————————
Uh, I guess it's about...[var]?
OK! Press [A] and release it! Quick!
———————————————
Ooh! Almost... You couldn't quite
hook it.
———————————————
Yeah... The moment the fish bites,
press [B] and tilt [+][^] to raise your
rod and hook the fish!
———————————————
The moment the fish bites, tilt your
[W] up to raise your rod.
———————————————
Ooh, no... Did that one get away?
———————————————
Once you get a strike, keep holding
[B] to keep the line from going
slack!
———————————————
Once you get a strike, keep reeling
with the Nunchuk to keep your line
taut.
———————————————
Awww... It got away when it
jumped...
———————————————
That's one of the fundamentals of
fishing, silly! When a fish jumps,
immediately lower your rod so it
doesn't get away!
———————————————
Ooh! You almost had it!
———————————————
When you reel the fish in close
and get a chance to land it, you'll
see Land [A]... Just be sure to press
[A] right then!
———————————————
When you reel the fish in close,
Land [A]+[B] will appear... Press [A]
and [B] right then!
———————————————
That looks to be about [var]...
but there are bigger fish out there!
OK! Press [A] to release it.
———————————————
Do you want to try a different type
of fishing?
———————————————
[.]This is fine.
[.]I'll try bobber fishing.
———————————————
[.]This is fine.
[.]I'll try lure fishing.
———————————————
Wait! No! That way is dangerous!
———————————————
Knock it off...
———————————————
Hey! It's a greengill! That's a great
fish for beginners. It's pretty easy
to catch one, right? Press [A] to
release it. Try for something else!
———————————————
Hey! It's a greengill! That's a great
fish for beginners. It's pretty easy

———————————————
Well, when you're done looking at
it, press [A] to release it, OK?
———————————————
Hmm... Another greengill, huh?
Well, let's release it with [A].
———————————————
Hmm... Another greengill, huh?
Well, let's release it with [A].

———————————————
Huh?
———————————————
An old boot...
———————————————
Ah ha ha ha ha! That's like straight
out of a comic! Brilliant! You're
pretty funny, you know that?
———————————————
Ooh! Don't throw it back in!
Just press [A] to dispose of it in
the trash!
———————————————
Ooh! Don't throw it back in!
Just press [A] to dispose of it in
the trash!
———————————————
Yuck! Another disgusting boot...
Dearie me! Whose is THAT?
———————————————
Sorry for making you dispose of it
by pressing [A]. I feel bad making
you clean out my pond...
———————————————
Sorry for making you dispose of it
with [A]. I feel bad making you
clean out my pond for me.
———————————————
When you're ready to fish, first
grab your rod with [B] and use [+]
to choose a direction to cast in.
———————————————
Then tilt [C][^] and release quickly
to cast your lure.
———————————————
When your lure hits the water, you
can give it some action with [<][+][>]
and reel it in with [B].
———————————————
When a fish bites on the line, hold
down [B] and use [+] and [^] to tilt
your rod up to set the hook.
———————————————
Once you've got one on the line,
keep your rod up and bring him in
with [B]!
———————————————
But if the fish jumps, you need to
lower your rod again or it'll get off
the hook!
———————————————
When you've reeled him in nice and
close, you'll see [A] on-screen.
Press [A] right then to land that
sucker!
———————————————
Well, good luck!
———————————————
When you're ready to fish, first
grab your pole with [B] and use [+]
to choose a direction to cast.
———————————————
Next, hold down [A] and tilt back [W].
Swing forward and release [A] to
cast away! Watch that lure go!
———————————————
When your lure hits the water, you
can move it by swinging [W] and
reel it in by twirling the Nunchuk.
———————————————
When you get a bite, straighten the
[W] to lift your rod.
———————————————
Once you're sure you've got one
firmly on the hook, keep your rod
up and reel it in by twirling the
Nunchuk!
———————————————
When you've reeled him in nice and
close, you'll see Land [A]+[B]...
Press [A] and [B] at the same time
as soon as you see it!
———————————————
There's a lot of fish by the banks,
so if you cast from the water
toward the banks, you'll be in
good shape.
———————————————
If there are no fish where you've
cast, you can reel in quickly using
[+][^] and try a different spot.
———————————————
If there are no fish where you've
cast, you can reel in by twirling the
Nunchuk and try a different spot.
———————————————
You can change the camera
position while fishing with [C]. Give
it a shot!
———————————————
You can change the camera
position while fishing with [o].
Give it a shot!
———————————————
The secret to making your lure
move realistically is to jiggle it then
let it sit. Keep repeating that
action!
———————————————
Thing is, if you move it too quickly,
or if you let it sit too long, the fish
will lose interest, so be careful!
———————————————
Use [B] to cast!
———————————————
Then watch your bobber carefully.
If it bobs, tilt [C][^] quickly, OK?
If you've hooked yourself a fish,
you've gotta bring him in!
———————————————
Once he's secure on the line there,
bring him in by tilting [C][^]!
———————————————
When you cast, swing [W] forward
and keep it tilted down until your
bobber hits the water.
———————————————
Then watch your bobber carefully.
If it bobs, raise your [W] quickly,
OK? If you've hooked a fish, you've
gotta bring him in!
———————————————
Once he's secure on the line there,
reel him in with [W] upright!
———————————————
You won't be able to cast if there's
an obstacle in the way. Don't 
forget that!
———————————————
Hey! It's dripping wet! Not only is
that dangerous, but it'll scare all
the fish off, silly!
———————————————
Awww! A young Hyrule bass!
How cute!
———————————————
Let's release it and catch it with a
lure when it gets bigger!
———————————————
Aww... Another baby bass!
Back you go, li'l fella!
———————————————
Hey! A young Hylian pike!
———————————————
I wouldn't mind keeping this one
as a pet...but we should really let
him go.
———————————————
What?! Another baby pike? Mmm...
Seems a waste, but let's release
the little guy.
———————————————
Whoa! A young Hylian loach!
———————————————
A legend among legends...
This one'll be worth a lot as an
adult, so let's release him.
———————————————
You're kidding me! Another juvenile
Hylian loach!
———————————————
You've got some skills! But we still
have to release this one so he can
grow up, OK?
———————————————
Wow... It's a young Ordon catfish!
They're still kinda cute at this size,
aren't they?
———————————————
Another tiny catfish. I get hungry
just looking at these guys.
———————————————
I wouldn't mind frying him up, but
we don't have the time, so let's
just release him.
———————————————
Aren't those little ducks so cute?
They're my pets!
———————————————
My favorite fishing spot is near the
natural bridge in the center of the
lake. But if you're looking for
lunkers, go to a waterfall!
———————————————
Paddle the canoe around and look
for a good spot. But don't get too
close, 'cause the fish will swim off!
———————————————
Oh, a dragonfly!

———————————————
Whoa! Your first fish caught using a
lure! That's a fish to remember!
———————————————
Congrats! You caught yourself the
definitive lake fish, a good old
Hyrule bass!
———————————————
Your fish looks to be [var]!
What do you wanna do?
———————————————
Wow! Look at that! You landed a
Hylian pike! Anglers everywhere
are going crazy about this fish!
———————————————
It looks to be about [var].
What do you wanna do?
———————————————
Oh... An Ordon catfish, huh?
Not much demand for these...
———————————————
It's not that they aren't kinda cute,
but they're slimy, you know?
———————————————
Let's see, it's about [var]...
What do you wanna do?
———————————————
DEARIE ME!
———————————————
Th-That... That's a legendary
Hylian loach!
———————————————
You can't catch one just like that!
It... It's just not right...
———————————————
Amazing... From now on, I'm calling
you [Link], Fish Master!
———————————————
Oh... Right... I got so excited,
I forgot to measure your fish.
———————————————
Ooh... It's about [var].
So um, wh-what do you wanna do?
———————————————
Oh, wow! That's a Hyrule bass!
Sizewise I'd say it's about
[var], or so.
———————————————
This one's a record breaker, so
you can keep it if you like. What do
you say?
———————————————
Ooh, that's a Hylian pike! Looks
like it's about [var].
———————————————
This one's a record breaker, so
you can keep it if you like. What do
you say?
———————————————
Whoa! An Ordon catfish! And it's
[var]!
———————————————
This one's a record breaker, so
you can keep it if you like. What do
you say?
———————————————
DEARIE ME!
———————————————
You... You caught ANOTHER Hylian
loach?!
———————————————
And I saw the very moment you
landed it with my own eyes!
Incredible!
———————————————
Sizewise it looks to be about...
[var]! Hey! That's bigger than
mine! You'll keep it, right?
Won't you?!
———————————————
Wh-What are you doing...?
———————————————
Oh! A Hyrule bass!
———————————————
I guess it's about [var]...
It's a little on the small side, so
you ought to release it.
———————————————
Oh! A Hylian pike!
———————————————
Aw, but it looks like it's only about
[var]... It's a little too small
to keep now, so you ought to
release it.
———————————————
Ah! Is that an Ordon catfish?
———————————————
It's roughly [var], huh? That's
too small. Release it! Release!
———————————————
That size looks to be...[var]...
Oh, too bad! That's smaller than
the last one! It's a waste, but you'll
have to let the little guy go...
———————————————
What's that? A Piece of Heart?!
———————————————
Ooh, whose heart did you catch?
You big sweetheart!
———————————————
Don't be shy! This one's yours to
keep!
———————————————
Are you going to keep this fish?
———————————————
That's a Hyrule bass ([var])!
Competition is fierce to catch a
record size of this fishing-hole
standard!
———————————————
That's a Hylian pike ([var])!
It's the fish notorious for winning
over fans with its closed eyes.
———————————————
That's an Ordon catfish ([var])!
From Ordon like [Link]!
It's not too popular at the fishing
hole...
———————————————
That's a Hylian loach ([var] )!
This rare fish is a legend among
true anglers, and catching an adult
is ultrarare!
———————————————
It's a new record! Will you keep
this fish?
———————————————
That's a Hylian loach ([var])!
You landed another of the
legendary fish!
———————————————
That's a Hyrule bass ([var])!
There's a heated battle for a
record-sized bass. It's not larger
than your record, so release it.
———————————————
That's a Hylian pike ([var])!
Anglers are really into this fish
right now. It's not larger than your
record, so release it.
———————————————
That's an Ordon catfish ([var])!
From Ordon like [Link]!
It's not larger than your record,
so you should release it.
———————————————
That's a Hylian loach ([var])!
You caught another of the
legendary fish! It's not larger than
your record, so release it.
———————————————
You caught a Piece of Heart!
Or...it caught you! Keep it close
to your chest.
———————————————
Oh, no! That was sooo close! You
just failed to land it.
———————————————
When a fish bites on the line,
immediately hold down [B] and tilt
[+][^] to keep your rod tilted up.
Hopefully, you'll get a hit!
———————————————
Ooh, no... Did that one get away?
———————————————
When you get a hit, keep your pole
up, press and hold [B], and don't let
your line go slack.
———————————————
Awww! You lost it when it jumped!
———————————————
That's the challenge of fishing for
you, though! If a fish jumps,
you need to lower your rod
immediately or it'll get off the line!
———————————————
Ooh! You almost had it!
———————————————
When you've reeled him in nice and
close, press [A] when you see
Land [A] appear!
———————————————
You can just give up on THAT
idea! It's dangerous over there!
———————————————
Don't go doing stuff you shouldn't
be doing!
———————————————
When you're ready to fish, first
grab your rod with [B] and use
[<][+][>] to choose where to cast.
———————————————
Then tilt [C][^] and release quickly
to cast your lure.
———————————————
When your lure hits the water, you
can move it with [<][+][>] and reel it
in with [B].
———————————————
When a fish bites on the line,
immediately hold down [B] and tilt
[+][^] to keep your rod tilted up.
Hopefully, you'll get a hit!
———————————————
Once you're sure you've got one
firmly on the hook, keep your rod
up and reel it in with [B]!
———————————————
But if it jumps, you have to tilt your
rod forward or you'll lose it, so
pay attention, all right?
———————————————
If you manage to reel one in close,
you'll see "Land  [A]" appear, so then
just press [A] at the right moment
to bring him in!
———————————————
Good luck!
———————————————
There are a lot of fish by the banks,
so if you cast from the water
toward the banks, you'll be in
good shape.
———————————————
If there are no fish where you've
cast, you can reel in quickly using
[+][^] and try a different spot.
———————————————
When moving in the canoe, you can
press [C][v] to change the camera to
first-person view, so use that to
your advantage!
———————————————
The secret to making your lure
move realistically is to jiggle it then
let it sit. Keep repeating that
lure action!
———————————————
Thing is, if you move it too quickly,
or if you let it sit too long, the fish
will lose interest, so be careful!
———————————————
Use your canoe to paddle around
and search for a good spot! Be
careful, though, you'll spook the
fish if you get too close!
———————————————
I'd recommend the natural bridge
in the middle of the lake. That's a
good spot.

———————————————
Oh, yeah! If you're after big boys,
try the area around the waterfall!
———————————————
Aww... Looks like it slipped clean
off!
———————————————
If you try to hook a fish too quickly
with the frog lure, you might lose
it... That's what makes it so hard.
———————————————
You might want to give it a little
more time before you try to hook it.
———————————————
Aw, AGAIN! You lost it! Try giving
it just a hair more time before you
hook it.
———————————————
Your timing is a little off...
When a fish bites, tilt your rod
upright with [+][^] and press [B].
———————————————
Ooh, you blew it... When you get a
hit, use [+][^] and press [B] to keep
your line taut.
———————————————
Ahh, you blew it... When the fish
jumps, tilt that rod forward and
give it some slack.
———————————————
That's no way to land a fish...



When you reel him in close, you
need to time it well and press [A]
right when you see Land [A].
———————————————
Ooh, you lost it...



When you try to set the hook too
quickly with the frog lure, it can
come loose, so be patient and
let the fish nibble for a bit.
———————————————
Hi there!
———————————————
Hey! You... You've never been here
before, have you?
———————————————
Well, I'm the owner of this fishing
hole. My name's Hena.
———————————————
Nice to meet ya!
———————————————
Huh? You're heading for home
already? That was sure quick!
———————————————
It's 20 Rupees to try some lure
fishing. There's no time limit, and
the canoe rental's included!
———————————————
Wanna give it a shot?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
You wanna try some lure fishing?
———————————————
It's 20 Rupees for the whole deal.
There's no time limit, and the
canoe rental's included. That
sound OK?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
It's 20 Rupees to try some lure
fishing. There's no time limit, and
the canoe rental's included!
———————————————
You can also get yourself a
charming and savvy guide, but that
deluxe fishing package will run you
100 Rupees!
———————————————
What do you say? Hmm?
———————————————
[.]Go it alone
[.]Hire a guide
[.]Quit
———————————————
Dearie me! I'm sorry! I don't know
why, but sometimes I just get
itchy...
———————————————
But anyway, how about trying some
lure fishing?
———————————————
There's no time limit, and you get a
canoe for only 20 Rupees! Ready to
give it a try?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
Dearie me! I'm sorry! I don't know
why, but sometimes I just get
itchy...
———————————————
So how about trying some lure
fishing?
———————————————
It'll cost you 20 Rupees to go out
on your own, or 100 Rupees with a
guide. What do you wanna do?
———————————————
[.]Go it alone
[.]Hire a guide
[.]Quit
———————————————
Hey... Fine fishing.
———————————————
You didn't catch anything, but hey,
that's fishing, y'know?
———————————————
Don't give up, though. You've gotta
keep trying!
———————————————
Fine fishing! Did you catch the fish
you were aiming for?
———————————————
I put your keepers in the fish tank,
so come on back and try your luck
anytime, OK?
———————————————
Dearie me! A Hylian loach!
———————————————
Wow... I've never actually met
someone who's caught one before!
———————————————
I'll put this beaut in the fish tank
and take extra-special care of him!
———————————————
Oh, dearie me! You caught
ANOTHER Hylian loach?
———————————————
Wow... Unbelievable...
———————————————
Hey, I'd be honored to keep this
guy in the fish tank for you!
———————————————
Fine fishing.
———————————————
Didn't catch any big boys, huh?
That's tough luck!
———————————————
You'll just have to get out there
and reel in a monster next time!
———————————————
Fine fishing!
———————————————
Ah ha ha ha... I know your secret...
———————————————
You landed a monster but decided
not to keep it, didn't you?
———————————————
That is the sign of a true master
fisherman.
———————————————
OK!
———————————————
Well, seeing how this is your first
time and all, I'll throw in the guide
service for free!
———————————————
Let's get fishing!
———————————————
OK!
———————————————
If you're not up to speed on how
to fish, just read the instruction
booklet I've packed in. Use [Z] to
read it.
———————————————
See you later, then! Happy fishing!
———————————————
OK! Let's get fishing!
———————————————
Hmm? You sure?
———————————————
Go ahead and poke around the
shop a bit if you want.
———————————————
If you see anything that catches
your fancy, use [C][v] to zoom in for
a closer look, OK?
———————————————
Ooh... Dearie me... You have no
money, silly!
———————————————
I'm sorry, but if I let everyone in
without paying, this place would be
a zoo. Come back with Rupees!
———————————————
That's a special fish tank just for
my customers!
———————————————
I'm fond of those greengills, of
course, but if you catch anything,
I'll toss it in, too!
———————————————
Of course, I don't wanna encourage
overfishing, so I only keep the
biggest of each fish type that gets
brought in.
———————————————
Those old greengills like company,
so get out there and catch 'em
some friends, will ya?
———————————————
That's a special fish tank just for
my customers!
———————————————
Yeah, I like to display the fish my
customers catch.
———————————————
Of course, I don't wanna encourage
overfishing, so I only keep the
biggest of each fish type that gets
brought in.
———————————————
The fish you can catch in this
pond are...
———————————————
Your standard Hyrule bass... Ooh,
the Hylian pike, the star of jumping
fish... The Ordon catfish, not that
anyone really likes 'em...
———————————————
And they say you can catch the
legendary Hylian loach around
here, too, but I've never caught
one...
———————————————
To tell the truth, I'd be happy just
SEEING one of those things!
———————————————
See, it's been a dream of mine to
fill this tank with one of each kind
of fish and build myself a little
aquarium, know what I mean?
———————————————
Give it your best shot! I'm counting
on you!
———————————————
To think I'd see the day where I'd
have a Hylian loach to look at every
day...
———————————————
Just amazing! Thank you so much!
And congrats!
———————————————
Ah... What a sweet feeling...
———————————————
See, it's been a dream of mine to
fill this tank with one of each kind
of fish and build myself a little
aquarium, know what I mean?
———————————————
I just can't believe my dream would
come true so soon!
———————————————
I couldn't have filled this without
your help! Three cheers for the
master fisherman, [Link]!
———————————————
Ah... What a sweet feeling...
———————————————
I still can't believe my dream came
true so quickly!
———————————————
I couldn't have filled this without
your help! Three cheers for the
master fisherman, [Link]!
———————————————
You can only fish with floating
lures here, and I lend out three
different types.
———————————————
The basic lure's the swimmer type,
but I also have poppers and 
spinners!
———————————————
Ooh, and I also have a frog type,
but that's kinda tough to use.
———————————————
I only lend THAT to people who can
beat that game next to the door.
———————————————
Sinking lures are NOT allowed!
That's what we call CHEATING!
———————————————
Basically, I lend out three types of
lures: swimmers, poppers, and
spinners.
———————————————
Ooh, and for anyone who can beat
the game by the door there, I also
have a frog type!
———————————————
Sinking lures are NOT allowed!
That's what we call CHEATING!
———————————————
Those things attract even the fish
that aren't really hungry. Does
that sound fun to you? No.
———————————————
Not only is it no fun, but it's bad
for the ecosystem. It changes fish's
feeding habits, and then NOBODY
will be able to catch them.
———————————————
Sinking lures have been banned
here for generations: that's why
you can still catch fish here!
———————————————
Sinking lures are NOT allowed!
That's what we call CHEATING!
———————————————
The best part of fishing with lures
is the instant when the fish rises
to the surface and hits your lure!
CHOMP!
———————————————
That's a frog lure. It's as cute as a
button, but it's kind of a handful to
use, just so you know.
———————————————
It doesn't get hung up on logs and
such very easily, so it's great for
bass fishing, but on the other
hand, the hook's hard to set.
———————————————
You can only use a frog lure if you
beat the Rollgoal game I designed!
And you have to beat EVERY level!
———————————————
The key to using a frog lure is not
setting the hook right away. You
have to let the fish nibble on it a
little bit.
———————————————
Ooh, that's my private boat, sorry.
I don't lend it out to customers.
———————————————
It's a two-seater, so I only use it
when I have a boyfriend.
———————————————
That's for me and my boyfriend,
and nobody else.
———————————————
Don't ask me how many boys have
been in that canoe! A lady never
kisses and tells!
———————————————
I'm not gonna tell you the last time
I rode in that canoe...
———————————————
Soooo cute, isn't she? Her name's
Purdy!
———————————————
She even talks sometimes!
———————————————
That's mine.
———————————————
Y'know, it's generally considered
polite to take your hat off when you
come indoors...
———————————————
When you come inside, you're
supposed to take off your hat!
That's just good manners!
———————————————
I'm not saying you have to do it,
but I figured I ought to at least tell
you. Someday you might offend
someone less laid-back than me! 
———————————————
What's your story? Aren't you a
little young to be interested in
jar collecting?
———————————————
I don't want those to get broken,
so I store 'em up out of the way.
———————————————
It sounds crazy, but I've heard
stories of people who have nothing
better to do than go around
breaking every jar they see.
———————————————
I mean, is that the dumbest thing
you've ever heard in your life?!
Who would DO that?!
———————————————
That's a beautiful pattern, isn't it?
———————————————
I just love it, so I keep it on display
all year long.
———————————————
But...I wash it, of course!
———————————————
You looking at the carpet again?
———————————————
Ummm... Take my word for it,
there's nothing that interesting
down there.
———————————————
That's the ultimate fish book:



The Legend of the Hylian Loach:
Twilight Fish!
———————————————
Ah, the loach... Like bass, loaches
prefer the shallows. They love
frogs, but they're antsy, so they'll
bolt when humans are around.
———————————————
They're not very active in cold
weather either, so the best season
to catch 'em in is summer!
———————————————
That book's a real tearjerker, too!
It's about how a young Hylian
loach saves Hyrule... I've read it so
many times, I can almost recite it.
———————————————
You want me to give you an idea
about how The Legend of the
Hylian Loach: Twilight Fish goes?
———————————————
[.]Sure!
[.]No, thanks.
———————————————
Really? But it's SUCH a good
story...
———————————————
Ah, the loach... Like bass, loaches
prefer the shallows. They love
frogs, but they're antsy, so they'll
bolt when humans are around.
———————————————
They're not very active in cold
weather either, so the best season
to catch 'em in is summer!
———————————————
That book's a real tearjerker, too!
It's about how a young Hylian
loach saves Hyrule... I've read it so
many times, I can almost recite it.
———————————————
That's one of Hyrule's legendary
master fisherman! Look, he's got a
Hylian loach, doesn't he?
———————————————
He just may be one of my
ancestors!
———————————————
Of course, I can't exactly PROVE
that... It's kinda just wishful
thinking on my part.
———————————————
The Legendary Hyrulian Master
Fisherman... Wish I could've been
born in that era.
———————————————
That's my older brother, Coro,
and a 25-inch Ordon catfish he
caught.
———————————————
He's the only one in our family
who's lousy at fishing. He only
managed to catch that fish by using
a sinking lure. Cheater...
———————————————
Another thing about my lazy
brother... I ask him to drop by and
help out from time to time, but he
never does.
———————————————
He can't fish a lick, so he spends
his time in the woods, talking to
the animals, I guess. Yeah, he's
kinda worthless...
———————————————
That's my older sister. That shot is
from the day she caught herself a
17-inch Hyrule bass.
———————————————
Her name's Iza, by the way.
———————————————
Make sure you drop by her boat-
rental shop sometime, OK?
———————————————
What's your story? You looking at
my sister's picture again?
———————————————
Is she your type or something?
You have WEIRD taste.
———————————————
That's me and the first fish I caught
here, a 28-inch Hylian pike!
———————————————
I swear, I'll never forget that day.
Such sweet memories...
———————————————
Yeah, a lot of folks tell me this
picture is really cute...
———————————————
'Cause it catches the pike's good
side.
———————————————
That's a 22-inch Hyrule bass I
caught!
———————————————
It's not very big, but it's a fish I
spotted and caught all by myself,
so I took that picture!
———————————————
Um, why are you staring at that
photo when the real me is standing
right here, silly?
———————————————
So, um, tell me... Between this
picture and the picture of my sister
Iza, which one do you think's
cuter?
———————————————
[.]Hena's photo!
[.]Iza's photo!
[.]They're both cute!
———————————————
Ooh, really? ...Y'know, I don't care
if you're just being nice, I'm still
happy! You're too sweet!
———————————————
I promise I won't breathe a word to
my sister, so don't worry!
———————————————
Ugh... You're about as dense as a
chunk of rock.
———————————————
At a time like this, you've GOTTA
pick me, even if you're lying!
———————————————
Ugh...
———————————————
You're a pretty smooth talker, huh?
———————————————
This weather feels so gooooood!
———————————————
Sure is lousy weather today, huh?
———————————————
But lousy weather means good
fishing! You knew that, right?
———————————————
Ooh, that caught your eye, did it?
I made that game, y'know!
———————————————
I gave it a really fun name, too...
ROLLGOAL!
———————————————
It costs 5 Rupees to play, but
you win 10 Rupees if you make it
to the goal!
———————————————
Well? So? Wanna play?
———————————————
[.]Sure!
[.]No, thanks.
———————————————
Hey, sorry, business is business.
You need money to play!
———————————————
Ooh... That's too bad...
———————————————
Rollgoal Level [var]
One play for 5 Rupees. You win
10 Rupees if you make it to the
goal! Wanna play?
———————————————
[.]Yup!
[.]No, thanks.
———————————————
The rules are simple! Use [o] to roll
the glass ball along the path all the
way to the goal within the time limit
without dropping the ball!
You can change the angle of the
camera with [C], so use that well!
———————————————
Ready? Press [A] to start!
———————————————
You understand the rules already,
right? OK! Then let's roll!
———————————————
Too bad! Time's up! ...Want to play
again?
———————————————
Oopsie-daisy! Game over! Wanna
try again?
———————————————
[.]Yes
[.]No
———————————————
ROLLGOOAAAL!
———————————————
Congrats! And here's your prize of
10 Rupees!
———————————————
Wow, you cleared it... Guess I'll
have to make a new course for the
next time you drop in. Promise
you'll play it, OK?
———————————————
ROLLGOOAAAL!
———————————————
Way to go! You cleared every level!
You're amazing!
———————————————
Now that you've cleared my
Rollgoal game, you've earned the
right to use the frog lure!
———————————————
Hey, take it easy! What're you
doing?! You're spooking the fish!
———————————————
Hey, take it easy! You be nice to
Purdy!
———————————————
Hey, take it easy! There's no call
for that!
———————————————
C'mon... Can't you try to control
yourself? I'm gonna have to ask
you to leave.
———————————————
That's it! Enough! You're being a
jerk! Get OUT!
———————————————
...What?
———————————————
[.]Sorry...
[.]I apologize.
[.]Please forgive me!
———————————————
If saying sorry solved everything,
all the soldiers in Hyrule would be
out of jobs...
———————————————
Fine. Apology accepted.
———————————————
Go-OOD moor-NING!
———————————————
How-DEE!
———————————————
Go-OOD eve-NING!
———————————————
Pur-DEE's pur-DEE!
———————————————
Iii-DIOT!
———————————————
Pur-DEE hate YOU!
———————————————
Scra-AAM!
———————————————
Go ho-OME!
———————————————
You like that, huh? It's a good
picture, right?
———————————————
I snapped a photo of the time you
caught the legendary Hylian loach!
———————————————
I kinda tweaked it a little... Ah ha ha ha!
———————————————
Yeah, that's the legendary
[Link], Master Fisherman.
———————————————
I'll show folks your picture and
spread word of your skills!
———————————————
What's your story? You still looking
at your own picture?
———————————————
You're sort of a narcissist, huh?
———————————————
Oh... All done?
———————————————
Too bad this time, huh? Oh, well...
It happens...
———————————————
Well, better luck next time!
———————————————
Hey, all done? Woo! That was fun,
wasn't it?
———————————————
I put the fish you kept into the
tank! We should fish together again
sometime!
———————————————
Wow... That was seriously amazing!
———————————————
I watched as a Hylian loach was
reeled in before my very eyes!
I still can't believe it!
———————————————
Thanks! I'll keep it in the
aquarium!
———————————————
Wow... I should've expected as
much from Master Fisherman
[Link]!
———————————————
I never would have imagined
someone catching so many
legendary Hylian loaches!
———————————————
I'm proud just to have been guiding
you!
———————————————
All done?
———————————————
Too bad you didn't catch any big
ones this time!
———————————————
You'll have to try harder next time
to catch a huge one you can keep!
———————————————
All done!
———————————————
It was a bit surprising that you
didn't land any big ones you could
keep, I've gotta say!
———————————————
Way to go! You really are a skilled
angler!
———————————————
Next time you come, I'll have a new
course ready for you, so be sure to
come back and play again!
———————————————
Rollgoal Level [var]
One play for 5 Rupees. Win 10
Rupees if you make it to the goal!
Same course, though. Wanna play?
———————————————
Hena's OLD! Very OLD!
———————————————
Hey! Purdy! I told you to quit
telling lies!
———————————————
PURDY! Enough already!
———————————————
You already cleared all my Rollgoal
games, so I don't have any new
challenges for you...
———————————————
So I guess I'll just have to start
up a harder version of the game
with shorter time limits!
———————————————
Rollgoal Game Level [var]
One play for 5 Rupees. Win 10
Rupees if you make it to the goal!
Want to play the harder version?
———————————————
You've already cleared it, so the
prize is the same old 10 Rupees!
———————————————
You cleared 'em all again! That's
kind of annoying...but I guess given
how much you've played it, it was
worth the effort making it...
———————————————
HEY!
———————————————
Come on! You know that's
cheating! The rules say you have
to roll it on the path! Do over!
———————————————
I told you, no cheating! Do over!
Do over!
———————————————
Don't CHEAT next time!
———————————————
Ugh! I'm sick of you cheating! You
have to roll down the entire path
within the time limit!
———————————————
Oh, dearie me! Talk about
frustrating! You almost had it, too!
———————————————
If you were that close this time,
just one more try should get you
there, right? Want to try again?
———————————————
GOOOAAALLL!!!!
———————————————
I never would've thought anyone
would get this far...
———————————————
Wow! This is really gonna cost me!
But I have to fill your wallet!
———————————————
I can't give you any more Rupees
after this, but if you want to play
my special-edition Rollgoal game, 
come see me again!
———————————————
It's the special-edition Rollgoal
game!
———————————————

———————————————
Aw, if you're wondering what
things look like outside, why don't
you just go out and see for
yourself?
———————————————
Some people just don't know their
manners...
———————————————
There's so much trash out here,
sometimes folks reel it in when
they're trying to fish!
———————————————
People who can't be nice to Mother
Nature will never make good
fishermen, y'know...
———————————————
It's because of litterbugs that some
people reel in trash!
———————————————
People who litter will never make
good fishermen, that's what I say.
———————————————
Oh! Well, aren't you a rarity!
———————————————
Speaking of rare, I saw something
rare mixed in with the trash around
the bridge.
———————————————
It was so shiny... I wonder what it
was?
———————————————
Shining like that...
———————————————
It was mixed in with trash, so I
assume someone threw it away,
right?
———————————————
Be careful! It's coming!
———————————————
Now kick 'em around!
———————————————
Looks like the shock of that impact
not only raised the water level, but
sped up the flow, too...
———————————————
This water should flow all the way
down to the lake. Why don't you let
it take you there?
———————————————
Well, we've taken care of the water!
Now let's find the Tears of Light!
———————————————
Oh... Hey... What's going on here?
———————————————
I thought it was getting colder...but
who would have thought that it
would all be frozen?!
———————————————
This is the Zora village, right? Why
don't I see any, then...
———————————————
Well... Anyway, let's check things
out. Let's find the Zoras...
———————————————
Fishing Hole

Bobber fishing open to public.
Check in for lure fishing!
(Sinking lures prohibited!)
———————————————
           DON'T LITTER!
Do NOT toss empty bottles or
cans here! The fish are CRYING!

Keep the fishing hole clean!
———————————————
I-I saw it, too! It was a big,
manlike beast covered in thick hair!
It was holding something, and it
went running toward the east!

Lure Fishing Primer (by Hena)
What do you want to read?
([B] Return to fishing.)
———————————————
Casting Basics - 1
Press [B] to hold the rod, and tilt
[<][+][>] to choose where to cast.
———————————————
Casting Basics - 2
Hold [A] and raise [W], then snap [W]
forward and release [A] to fling out
the lure.
———————————————
Lure Action - 1
Jiggle [W] left and right to trigger
lure action.
———————————————
Lure Action - 3
Quickly rotate the Nunchuk to reel.
———————————————
Fighting the Fish - 1
When a fish bites, pull your rod
back with [W] to set the hook.
———————————————
Fighting the Fish - 2
Once the hook's set, hold the rod
up by keeping [W] upright. Twirl
the Nunchuk to keep the line taut.
———————————————
Fighting the Fish - 3
If the fish jumps, tilt [W] forward to
keep the hook firmly set.
———————————————
Fighting the Fish - 4
Bring the fish close to the canoe,
and when Land [A]+[B] appears,
press [A] and [B] at the same time.
———————————————
When a fish bites on the line,
tilt your rod up with [W]
to set the hook!
———————————————
Once you've got one on the line,
raise your rod with [W] and twirl the
Nunchuk to reel him in!
———————————————
When you've reeled him in nice and
close, press [A] and [B] together
when you see Land [A]+[B]!
———————————————
When you're ready to fish, first
grab your rod with [B] and use
[<][+][>] to choose where to cast.
———————————————
Then hold down [A] and raise your
rod with [W]. Next, quickly swing it
forward, releasing [A] as you swing
to cast your lure.
———————————————
When your lure hits the water, you
can move it by jiggling [W] left and
right.
———————————————
If there are no fish where you've
cast, you can reel in quickly by
rotating the Nunchuk. Then just
pick a new spot.
———————————————
When moving in the canoe, you can
press [C] to change the camera to
first-person view, so use that to
your advantage!
———————————————
Your timing is off... When a fish
bites, tilt your rod upright with [W].
———————————————
You blew it...



When you get a hit, use [W] to tilt
your rod and keep your line taut.
———————————————
That's no way to land a fish...



When you reel him in close, you
need to time it well and press
[A] and [B] right when you see
Land [A]+[B]!
———————————————
If you're not up to speed on how
to fish, just read the instruction
booklet I've packed in. Use [+^] to
read it.
———————————————
If you see anything that catches
your fancy, use [C] to zoom in for
a closer look, OK?
———————————————
The rules are simple! Tilt [W] to roll
the glass ball along the path all the
way to the goal within the time
limit...without dropping the ball! 
You can change the angle of the
camera with [o], so use that well!
———————————————
Ready? Press [A] to start!
