Bingo!

The CARD KEY
opened the door!


Darn! It needs a
CARD KEY!


Not even a nibble!


Looks like there's
nothing here.


Oh!
It's a bite!


Ground rose up
somewhere!

 This requires
STRENGTH to move!


All your item
needs fulfilled!

POKéMON MART


Heal Your POKéMON!
POKéMON CENTER


NINTEN found
{4B}!


No more room for
items!


Hi! Remember me?
I'm PROF.OAK's
AIDE!

If you caught {50}
kinds of POKéMON,
I'm supposed to
give you an
{50}!

So, NINTEN! Have
you caught at
least {50} kinds of
POKéMON?


Let's see...
Uh-oh! You have
caught only {50}
kinds of POKéMON!

You need {50} kinds
if you want the
{50}.


Oh. I see.
When you get {50}
kinds, come back
for {50}.


Great! You have
caught {50} kinds
of POKéMON!
Congratulations!

Here you go!

NINTEN got the
{50}!


Oh! I see you
don't have any
room for the
{50}.


I came here with
some friends!

They're out for
POKéMON fights!

Hey! You have
POKéMON! Come on!
Let's battle'em!


No!
CATERPIE can't
cut it!


Ssh! You'll scare
the bugs away!


Yo! You can't jam
out if you're a
POKéMON trainer!


Huh?
I ran out of
POKéMON!


Darn! I'm going
to catch some
stronger ones!


Hey, wait up!
What's the hurry?


I
give! You're good
at this!


Sometimes, you
can find stuff on
the ground!

I'm looking for
the stuff I
dropped!


I ran out of POKé
BALLs to catch
POKéMON with!

You should carry
extras!


TRAINER TIPS

If you want to
avoid battles,
stay away from
grassy areas!


For poison, use
ANTIDOTE! Get it
at POKéMON MARTs!


TRAINER TIPS

Contact PROF.OAK
via PC to get
your POKéDEX
evaluated!


TRAINER TIPS

No stealing of
POKéMON from
other trainers!
Catch only wild
POKéMON!


TRAINER TIPS

Weaken POKéMON
before attempting
capture!

When healthy,
they may escape!


LEAVING
VIRIDIAN FOREST
PEWTER CITY AHEAD


WHOA! You shocked
me! Oh, you're
just a kid!


Wow!
Shocked again!


Kids like you
shouldn't be
here!


Did you come to
explore too?


Losing
stinks!


I came down here
to show off to
girls.


Wow! It's way
bigger in here
than I thought!


Oh!
I lost it!


How do you get
out of here?


What! Don't sneak
up on me!


My
POKéMON won't do!


I have to find
stronger POKéMON.


What? I'm waiting
for my friends to
find me here.


I lost?


I heard there are
some very rare
fossils here.


Suspicious men
are in the cave.
What about you?


You
got me!


I saw them! I'm
sure they're from
TEAM ROCKET!


Go through this
cave to get to
CERULEAN CITY!


I
lost.


ZUBAT is tough!
But, it can be
useful if you
catch one.


Beware! ZUBAT is
a blood sucker!



You want the
DOME FOSSIL?


You want the
HELIX FOSSIL?


NINTEN got the
{50}!


Look, you've got
no room for this.


Hey, stop!

I found these
fossils! They're
both mine!


OK!
I'll share!


We'll each take
one!

No being greedy!


Far away, on
CINNABAR ISLAND,
there's a POKéMON
LAB.

They do research
on regenerating
fossils.


All right. Then
this is mine!


TEAM ROCKET will
find the fossils,
revive and sell
them for cash!


Urgh!
Now I'm mad!


You made me mad!
TEAM ROCKET will
blacklist you!


We, TEAM ROCKET,
are POKéMON
gangsters!


I blew
it!


Darn it all! My
associates won't
stand for this!


NINTEN! What are
you, seasick?

You should shape
up, pal!


SONY: I heard
there was a CUT
master on board.

But, he was just a
seasick, old man!

But, CUT itself is
really useful!

You should go see
him! Smell ya!


Our CAPTAIN is a
sword master!

He even teaches
CUT to POKéMON!


The party's over.
The ship will be
departing soon.


Scrubbing decks
is hard work!


Urf. I feel ill.

I stepped out to
get some air.


Hey matey!

Let's do a little
jig!


You're
impressive!


How many kinds of
POKéMON do you
think there are?


Ahoy there!
Are you seasick?


I was
just careless!


My Pa said there
are 100 kinds of
POKéMON. I think
there are more.


You, mon petit!
We're busy here!
Out of the way!


I saw an odd ball
in the trash.


I'm so busy I'm
getting dizzy!


Hum-de-hum-de-
ho...

I peel spuds
every day!
Hum-hum...


Did you hear about
SNORLAX?

All it does is
eat and sleep!


Snivel...Sniff...

I only get to
peel onions...
Snivel...


Er-hem! Indeed I
am le CHEF!

Le main course is


Salmon du Salad!

Les guests may
gripe it's fish
again, however!


Eels au Barbecue!

Les guests will
mutiny, I fear.


Prime Beef Steak!

But, have I enough
fillets du beef?


CAPTAIN: Ooargh...
I feel hideous...
Urrp! Seasick...

NINTEN rubbed
the CAPTAIN's
back!

Rub-rub...
Rub-rub...


CAPTAIN: Whew!
Thank you! I
feel much better!

You want to see
my CUT technique?

I could show you
if I wasn't ill...

I know! You can
have this!

Teach it to your
POKéMON and you
can see it CUT
any time!


NINTEN got
{4B}!


CAPTAIN: Whew!

Now that I'm not
sick any more, I
guess it's time.


Oh no! You have
no room for this!


Yuck! Shouldn't
have looked!


How to Conquer
Seasickness...
The CAPTAIN's
reading this!


WIGGLYTUFF: Puup
pupuu!


I travel alone
on my journeys!

My POKéMON are my
only friends!


My, my
friends...


You should be
nice to friends!


You pup! How dare
you barge in!


Humph!
You rude child!


I wish to be left
alone! Get out!


I love POKéMON!
Do you?


Wow!
You're great!


Let me be your
friend, OK?

Then we can trade
POKéMON!


I collected these
POKéMON from all
around the world!


Oh no!
I went around the
world for these!


You hurt my poor
worldly POKéMON!

I demand that you
heal them at a
POKéMON CENTER!


Waiter, I would
like a cherry pie
please!


A cruise is so
elegant yet cozy!


I always travel
with WIGGLYTUFF!


We are cruising
around the world.


Ssh! I'm a GLOBAL
POLICE agent!

I'm on the trail
of TEAM ROCKET!


In all my travels
I've never seen
any POKéMON sleep
like this one!

It was something
like this!


Ah yes, I have
seen some POKéMON
ferry people
across the water!


POKéMON can CUT
down small bushes.


Have you gone to
the SAFARI ZONE
in FUCHSIA CITY?

It had many rare
kinds of POKéMON!!


Me and my Daddy
think the SAFARI
ZONE is awesome!


The CAPTAIN looked
really sick and
pale!


I hear many people
get seasick!


Competing against
the young keeps
me youthful.


Good
fight! Ah, I feel
young again!


15 years ago, I
would have won!


Check out what I
fished up!


I'm
all out!


Party?

The cruise ship's
party should be
over by now.


Which do you like,
a strong or a
rare POKéMON?


I must
salute you!


I prefer strong
and rare POKéMON.


I never saw you
at the party.


Take
it easy!


Oh, I adore your
strong POKéMON!


MACHOKE: Gwoh!
Goggoh!


You know what they
say about sailors
and fighting!


Right!
Good fight, mate!


Haha! Want to be
a sailor, mate?


My sailor's pride
is at stake!


Your
spirit sank me!


Did you see the
FISHING GURU in
VERMILION CITY?


Us sailors have
POKéMON too!


OK,
you're not bad.


We caught all our
POKéMON while
out at sea!


I like feisty
kids like you!


Argh!
Lost it!


Sea POKéMON live
in deep water.
You'll need a ROD!


Matey, you're
walking the plank
if you lose!


Argh!
Beaten by a kid!


Jellyfish some-
times drift into
the ship.


Hello stranger!
Stop and chat!

All my POKéMON
are from the sea!


Darn!
I let that one
get away!


I was going to
make you my
assistant too!


My buddy, MACHOKE,
is super strong!

He has enough
STRENGTH to move
big rocks!


I heard rumors of
a child prodigy!


The
rumors were true!


You beat GIOVANNI
of TEAM ROCKET?


I'll show you just
how good you are!


I'm
furious!


You showed me just
how good I was!


Only the chosen
can pass here!


I
don't believe it!


All trainers here
are headed to the
POKéMON LEAGUE!
Be careful!


Trainers live to
seek stronger
opponents!


Oh!
So strong!


By fighting tough
battles, you get
stronger!


Why...?


Who are you? How
did you get here?


Oww!
Beaten!


Are you dissing
TEAM ROCKET?


You broke into
our operation?


Burnt!


You're not going
to get away with
this, brat!


Intruder alert!


I
can't do it!


SILPH SCOPE?
I don't know
where it is!


Why did you come
here?


This
won't do!


OK, I'll talk!
Take the elevator
to see my BOSS!


Are you lost, you
little rat?


Uh-oh, that fight
opened the door!


BOSS said you can
see GHOSTs with
the SILPH SCOPE!


I
surrender!


The TEAM ROCKET
HQ has 4 basement
floors. Can you
reach the BOSS?


Stop meddling in
TEAM ROCKET's
affairs!


Oof!
Taken down!


SILPH SCOPE?
The machine the
BOSS stole. It's
here somewhere.


We got word from
upstairs that you
were coming!


What?
I lost? No!


Go ahead and go!
But, you need the
LIFT KEY to run
the elevator!


So! I must say, I
am impressed you
got here!


WHAT!
This cannot be!


I see that you
raise POKéMON
with utmost care.

A child like you
would never
understand what I
hope to achieve.

I shall step
aside this time!

I hope we meet
again...


I know you! You
ruined our plans
at MT.MOON!


Burned
again!


Do you have
something against
TEAM ROCKET?


How can you not
see the beauty of
our evil?


Ayaya!


BOSS! I'm sorry I
failed you!


The elevator
doesn't work? Who
has the LIFT KEY?


No!


Oh no! I dropped
the LIFT KEY!


It appears to
need a key.


Eeek!
No! Stop! Help!

Oh, you're not
with TEAM ROCKET.
I thought...
I'm sorry. Here,
please take this!


NINTEN got
{4B}!


TM36 is
SELFDESTRUCT!

It's powerful, but
the POKéMON that
uses it faints!
Be careful.


You don't have any
room for this.


Help! I'm a SILPH
employee.


How
did you know I
was a ROCKET?


I work for both
SILPH and TEAM
ROCKET!


It's off limits
here! Go home!


You're
good.


Can you solve the
maze in here?


No kids are
allowed in here!


Tough!


Diamond shaped
tiles are
teleport blocks!

They're hi-tech
transporters!


Hey kid! What are
you doing here?


I goofed!


SILPH CO. will
be merged with
TEAM ROCKET!


I work for SILPH.
What should I do?


NINTEN! You and
your POKéMON
saved us!


Quit messing with
us, kid!


I give
up!


A hint? You can
open doors with a
CARD KEY!


I support TEAM
ROCKET more than
I support SILPH!


You
really got me!


Humph...

TEAM ROCKET said
that if I helped
them, they'd let
me study POKéMON!


Sssh! Can't you
see I'm hiding?


Huh? TEAM ROCKET
is gone?


TEAM ROCKET has
taken command of
SILPH CO.!


Arrgh!


Fwahahaha!
My BOSS has been
after this place!


My POKéMON are my
loyal soldiers!


Darn!
You weak POKéMON!


The doors are
electronically
locked! A CARD
KEY opens them!


Intruder spotted!


Who
are you?


I better tell the
BOSS on 11F!


TEAM ROCKET is
in an uproar over
some intruder.
That's you right?


TEAM ROCKET took
off! You're our
hero! Thank you!


I heard a kid was
wandering around.


Boom!


It's not smart
to pick a fight
with TEAM ROCKET!


We study POKé
BALL technology
on this floor!


Dang!
Blast it!


We worked on the
ultimate POKé
BALL which would
catch anything!


Whaaat? There
shouldn't be any
children here?


Oh
goodness!


You're only on 5F.
It's a long way
to my BOSS!


Show TEAM ROCKET
a little respect!


Cough...
Cough...


Which reminds me.

KOFFING evolves
into WEEZING!


It's a POKéMON
REPORT!

POKéMON LAB
created PORYGON,
the first virtual
reality POKéMON.


It's a POKéMON
REPORT!

Over 160 POKéMON
techniques have
been confirmed.


It's a POKéMON
REPORT!

4 POKéMON evolve
only when traded
by link-cable.


The ROCKETs came
and took over the
building!


Well, better get
back to work!


Oh dear, oh dear.
Help me please!


We got engaged!
Heheh!


Look at him! He's
such a coward!


I feel so sorry
for him, I have
to marry him!


TEAM ROCKET is
trying to conquer
the world with
POKéMON!


TEAM ROCKET ran
because of you!


They must have
targeted SILPH
for our POKéMON
products.


Come work for
SILPH when you
get older!


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Flame
out!


No matter!
My brothers will
avenge me!


That rotten
PRESIDENT!

He shouldn't have
sent me to the
TIKSI BRANCH!


Shoot!


TIKSI BRANCH?
It's in Russian
no man's land!


You dare betray
TEAM ROCKET?


You
traitor!


If you stand for
justice, you
betray evil!


Oh! Hi! You're
not a ROCKET! You
came to save us?
Why, thank you!

I want you to
have this POKéMON
for saving us.


It's LAPRAS. It's
very intelligent.

We kept it in our
lab, but it will
be much better
off with you!

I think you will
be a good trainer
for LAPRAS!

It's a good
swimmer. It'll
give you a lift!


TEAM ROCKET's
BOSS went to the
boardroom! Is our
PRESIDENT OK?


Saved at last!
Thank you!


TEAM ROCKET was
after the MASTER
BALL which will
catch any POKéMON!


We canceled the
MASTER BALL
project because
of TEAM ROCKET.


It would be bad
if TEAM ROCKET
took over SILPH
or our POKéMON!


Wow! You chased
off TEAM ROCKET
all by yourself?


You! It's really
dangerous here!
You came to save
me? You can't!


Safe at last!
Oh thank you!


Oh ho! I smell a
little rat!


Lights
out!


You won't find my
BOSS by just
scurrying around!


Heheh!

You mistook me for
a SILPH worker?


I'm
done!


Despite your age,
you are a skilled
trainer!


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Aack!
Brothers, I lost!


Doesn't matter.
My brothers will
repay the favor!


A child intruder?
That must be you!


Fine!
I lost!


Go on home
before my BOSS
gets ticked off!


SONY: What
kept you NINTEN?


SONY: Hahaha!
I thought you'd
turn up if I
waited here!

I guess TEAM
ROCKET slowed you
down! Not that I
care!

I saw you in
SAFFRON, so I
decided to see if
you got better!


Oh ho!
So, you are ready
for BOSS ROCKET!


SONY: How can
I put this?

You're not good
enough to play
with us big boys!


Well, NINTEN!

I'm moving on up
and ahead!

By checking my
POKéDEX, I'm
starting to see
what's strong and
how they evolve!

I'm going to the
POKéMON LEAGUE
to boot out the
ELITE FOUR!

I'll become the
world's most
powerful trainer!

NINTEN, well
good luck to you!
Don't sweat it!
Smell ya!


I wonder if SILPH
is finished...


Thanks for saving
us!


That's as far as
you'll go!


Not
enough grit!


If you don't turn
back, I'll call
for backup!


You're causing us
problems!


Huh?
I lost?


So, what do you
think of SILPH
BUILDING's maze?


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Whoo!
Oh brothers!


I'll leave you up
to my brothers!


You look tired!
You should take a
quick nap!


Don't give up!


Thank you so
much!


Your POKéMON seem
to adore you, kid!


Ghaaah!


If I had started
as a trainer at
your age...


Your POKéMON have
weak points! I
can nail them!


You
hammered me!


Exploiting weak
spots does work!
Think about
element types!


I am one of the 4
ROCKET BROTHERS!


Warg!
Brothers, I lost!


My brothers will
avenge me!


Waaaaa!
I'm scared!


Please keep quiet
about my crying!


Welcome to the
10F! So good of
you to join me!


I'm
stunned!


Nice try, but the
boardroom is up
one more floor!


Enough of your
silly games!


No
continues left!


Are you satisfied
with beating me?
Then go on home!


PRESIDENT: Thank
you for saving
SILPH!

I will never
forget you saved
us in our moment
of peril!

I have to thank
you in some way!

Because I am rich,
I can give you
anything!

Here, maybe this
will do!


NINTEN got a
{4B}!


PRESIDENT: You
can't buy that
anywhere!

It's our secret
prototype MASTER
BALL!

It will catch any
POKéMON without
fail!

You should be
quiet about using
it, though.


You have no
room for this.


SECRETARY: Thank
you for rescuing
all of us!

We admire your
courage.


Ah NINTEN!
So we meet again!

The PRESIDENT and
I are discussing
a vital business
proposition.

Keep your nose
out of grown-up
matters...

Or, experience a
world of pain!


Arrgh!!
I lost again!?


Blast it all!
You ruined our
plans for SILPH!

But, TEAM ROCKET
will never fall!

NINTEN! Never
forget that all
POKéMON exist
for TEAM ROCKET!

I must go, but I
shall return!


Stop right there!
Don't you move!


Don't...
Please!


So, you want to
see my BOSS?


Halt! Do you have
an appointment
with my BOSS?


Gaah!
Demolished!


Watch your step,
my BOSS likes his
POKéMON tough!


The monitor has
POKéMON on it!


I can't get out!
This old place is

Oh no!
My bag of loot!

Diary: July 5
Guyana,
South America

A new POKéMON was
discovered deep
in the jungle.


Diary: July 10
We christened the
newly discovered
POKéMON, MEW.


A secret switch!

Press it?


Who wouldn't?


Not quite yet!


This place is
like, huge!


Ayah!


I wonder where
my partner went.


My mentor once
lived here.


Whew!
Overwhelming!


So, you're stuck?
Try jumping off
over there!


Diary: Feb. 6
MEW gave birth.

We named the
newborn MEWTWO.


Uh-oh. Where am
I now?


Awooh!


You can find stuff
lying around.


This place is
ideal for a lab.


What
was that for?


I like it here!
It's conducive to
my studies!


Diary; Sept. 1
MEWTWO is far too
powerful.

We have failed to
curb its vicious
tendencies...

I was getting

Congratulations!
You have won!


NINTEN received

Tossing ROCKs at

I hiked a lot, but

I caught a

That makes this

I
lost out!


I never wanted to
lose to anybody!


I can see you're
good! Let me see
exactly how good!


I
had a chance...


I concede, you're
better than me!


Ah! I heard about
you NINTEN!

I lead the ELITE
FOUR! You can
call me LANCE the
dragon trainer!

You know that
dragons are
mythical POKéMON!

They're hard to
catch and raise,
but their powers
are superior!

They're virtually
indestructible!

Well, are you
ready to lose?

Your LEAGUE
challenge ends
with me, NINTEN!


That's it!

I hate to admit
it, but you are a
POKéMON master!


I still can't
believe my
dragons lost to
you, NINTEN!

You are now the
POKéMON LEAGUE
champion!

...Or, you would
have been, but
you have one more
challenge ahead.

You have to face
another trainer!
His name is...

SONY!
He beat the ELITE
FOUR before you!

He is the real
POKéMON LEAGUE
champion!


OAK: Er-hem!
Congratulations
NINTEN!

This floor is the
POKéMON HALL OF
FAME!

POKéMON LEAGUE
champions are
honored for their
exploits here!

Their POKéMON are
also recorded in
the HALL OF FAME!

NINTEN! You have
endeavored hard
to become the new
LEAGUE champion!

Congratulations,
NINTEN, you and
your POKéMON are
HALL OF FAMERs!


SONY: Hey!

I was looking
forward to seeing
you, NINTEN!

My rival should
be strong to keep
me sharp!

While working on
POKéDEX, I looked
all over for
powerful POKéMON!

Not only that, I
assembled teams
that would beat
any POKéMON type!

And now!

I'm the POKéMON
LEAGUE champion!

NINTEN! Do you
know what that
means?

I'll tell you!

I am the most
powerful trainer
in the world!


NO!
That can't be!
You beat my best!

After all that
work to become
LEAGUE champ?

My reign is over
already?
It's not fair!


Hahaha!
I won, I won!

I'm too good for
you, NINTEN!

You did well to
even reach me,
SONY, the
POKéMON genius!

Nice try, loser!
Hahaha!


Why?
Why did I lose?

I never made any
mistakes raising
my POKéMON...

Darn it! You're
the new POKéMON
LEAGUE champion!

Although I don't
like to admit it.


OAK: NINTEN!


OAK: So, you won!
Congratulations!
You're the new
POKéMON LEAGUE
champion!

You've grown up so
much since you
first left with
{50}!

NINTEN, you have
come of age!


OAK: SONY! I'm
disappointed!

I came when I
heard you beat
the ELITE FOUR!

But, when I got
here, you had
already lost!

SONY! Do you
understand why
you lost?

You have forgotten
to treat your
POKéMON with
trust and love!

Without them, you
will never become
a champ again!


OAK: NINTEN!

You understand
that your victory
was not just your
own doing!

The bond you share
with your POKéMON
is marvelous!

NINTEN!
Come with me!


Welcome to
POKéMON LEAGUE!

I am LORELEI of
the ELITE FOUR!

No one can best
me when it comes
to icy POKéMON!

Freezing moves
are powerful!

Your POKéMON will
be at my mercy
when they are
frozen solid!

Hahaha!
Are you ready?


How
dare you!


You're better
than I thought!
Go on ahead!

You only got a
taste of POKéMON
LEAGUE power!


Someone's voice:
Don't run away!


I am BRUNO of
the ELITE FOUR!

Through rigorous
training, people
and POKéMON can
become stronger!

I've weight
trained with
my POKéMON!

NINTEN!

We will grind you
down with our
superior power!

Hoo hah!


Why?
How could I lose?


My job is done!
Go face your next
challenge!


Someone's voice:
Don't run away!


I am AGATHA of
the ELITE FOUR!

OAK's taken a lot
of interest in
you, child!

That old duff was
once tough and
handsome! That
was decades ago!

Now he just wants
to fiddle with
his POKéDEX! He's
wrong! POKéMON
are for fighting!

NINTEN! I'll show
you how a real
trainer fights!


Oh ho!
You're something
special, child!


You win! I see
what the old duff
sees in you now!

I have nothing
else to say! Run
along now, child!


Someone's voice:
Don't run away!

Ohhh!

You have a
POKéDEX?
I want one too!


Shoot!
I'm so jealous!


When you finish
your POKéDEX, can
I have it?


Do you know about

Well,
that's that.


Costume players

You're a better

In mountains,
you'll often find
rock-type POKéMON.


I don't often
come here, but I
will fight you.


Oh!
I lost!


I like tiny
POKéMON, big ones
are too scary!


Hit me with your
best shot!


Fired

I'll raise my
POKéMON to beat
yours, kid!

It is true that a
higher level
POKéMON will be
more powerful...

But, all POKéMON
will have weak
points against
specific types.

So, there is no
universally
strong POKéMON.

Hello there!
Welcome to the
world of POKéMON!

My name is OAK!
People call me
the POKéMON PROF!


This world is
inhabited by
creatures called
POKéMON!


For some people,
POKéMON are
pets. Others use
them for fights.

Myself...

I study POKéMON
as a profession.


First, what is
your name?


This is my grand-
son. He's been
your rival since
you were a baby.

...Erm, what is
his name again?


NINTEN!

Your very own
POKéMON legend is
about to unfold!

A world of dreams
and adventures
with POKéMON
awaits! Let's go!


Do you want to
give a nickname
to {6D}?


Right! So your
name is NINTEN!


That's right! I
remember now! His
name is SONY!


and
{6D} will
be traded.


M9 ERROR.


I went to ROCK
TUNNEL, but it's
dark and scary.

If a POKéMON's
FLASH could light
it up...


Many POKéMON live
only in forests
and caves.

You need to look
everywhere to get
different kinds!


Have you noticed
the bushes on the
roadside?

They can be cut
down by a special
POKéMON move.


A fainted POKéMON
can't fight. But,
it can still use
moves like CUT!


The HM FLASH
lights even the
darkest dungeons.


Once a POKéMON
learns FLASH, you
can get through
ROCK TUNNEL.


Are you going to
VIRIDIAN FOREST?
Be careful, it's
a natural maze!


RATTATA may be
small, but its
bite is wicked!
Did you get one?


I've 6 POKé BALLs
set in my belt.

At most, you can
carry 6 POKéMON.


TEAM ROCKET
attacks CERULEAN
citizens...

TEAM ROCKET is
always in the
news!


MAN: Hello, there!
Have I got a deal
just for you!

I'll let you have
a swell MAGIKARP
for just ¥500!
What do you say?


No? I'm only
doing this as a
favor to you!


You'll need more
money than that!


MAN: Well, I don't
give refunds!


I'm on guard duty.
Gee, I'm thirsty,
though!

Oh wait there,
the road's closed.


Whoa, boy!
I'm parched!
...
Huh? I can have
this drink?
Gee, thanks!


...
Glug glug...
...
Gulp...
If you want to go
to SAFFRON CITY...
...
You can go on
through. I'll
share this with
the other guards!


Hi, thanks for
the cool drinks!


I run a DAYCARE.
Would you like me
to raise one of
your POKéMON?


Which POKéMON
should I raise?


Fine, I'll look
after {6D}
for a while.


Come see me in
a while.


Your {6D}
has grown a lot!

By level, it's
grown by {50}!

Aren't I great?


You owe me ¥{50}
for the return
of this POKéMON.


NINTEN got
{49} back!


Back already?
Your {6D}
needs some more
time with me.


All right then,
come again.


You have no room
for this POKéMON!


You only have one
POKéMON with you.


I can't accept a
POKéMON that
knows an HM move.


Thank you! Here's
your POKéMON!


Hey, you don't
have enough ¥!


People often lose
things in that
UNDERGROUND PATH.


I heard a sleepy
POKéMON appeared
near CELADON CITY.


I want to shop at
the dept. store
in CELADON but...

There are so many
rough looking
people there.


TEAM ROCKET had a
secret hideout in
CELADON CITY?


You're here to
shop in CELADON?

Just step outside
and head west!


The UNDERGROUND
PATH goes beneath
SAFFRON and leads
to LAVENDER.

If you're heading
to CERULEAN, go
to the building
across the road.


The dept. store
in CELADON has a
great selection!


The element types
of POKéMON make
them stronger
than some types
and weaker than
others!


I sold a useless
NUGGET for ¥5000!


This tunnel goes
a long way, kid!


Doh!
You win!


Watch for ONIX!
It can put the
squeeze on you!


Hmm. Maybe I'm
lost in here...


Ease up!
What am I doing?
Which way is out?


That sleeping
POKéMON on ROUTE
12 forced me to
take this detour.


Outsiders like
you need to show
me some respect!


I give!


You're talented
enough to hike!


POKéMON fight!
Ready, go!


Game
over!


Oh well, I'll get
a ZUBAT as I go!


Eek! Don't try
anything funny in
the dark!


It
was too dark!


I saw a MACHOP
in this tunnel!


I came this far
for POKéMON!


I'm
out of POKéMON!


You looked cute
and harmless!


You have POKéMON!
Let's start!


You
play hard!


Whew! I'm all
sweaty now!


ROCK TUNNEL
CERULEAN CITY -
LAVENDER TOWN


Bzzzt!


Gyaoo!


When you catch
lots of POKéMON,
isn't it hard to
think up names?

In LAVENDER TOWN,
there's a man who
rates POKéMON
nicknames.

He'll help you
rename them too!


There are items on
the ground that
can't be seen.

ITEMFINDER will
detect an item
close to you.

It can't pinpoint
it, so you have
to look yourself!


Looked into the
binoculars.

A big POKéMON is
asleep on a road!


Looked into the
binoculars.

It's a beautiful
view!


Looked into the
binoculars.

The only way to
get from CERULEAN
CITY to LAVENDER
is by way of the
ROCK TUNNEL.


What a surprise!
DIGLETTs dug this
long tunnel!

It goes right to
VIRIDIAN CITY!


There's a lookout
spot upstairs.


My POKéMON's
ashes are stored
in POKéMON TOWER.

You can have this
TM. I don't need
it any more...


NINTEN received
TM39!


TM39 is a move
called SWIFT.

It's very accurate,
so use it during
battles you can't
afford to lose.


You don't have
room for this.


Looked into the
binoculars.

A man fishing!


Looked into the
binoculars.

It's POKéMON TOWER!


I'm the FISHING
GURU's brother!

I simply Looove
fishing!

Do you like to
fish?


Grand! I like
your style!

Take this and
fish, young one!

NINTEN received
a {4B}!


Fishing is a way
of life!

From the seas to
rivers, go out
and land the big
one!


Oh... That's so
disappointing...


Hello there,
NINTEN!

Use the SUPER ROD
in any water!
You can catch
different kinds
of POKéMON.

Try fishing
wherever you can!


Oh no!

I had a gift for
you, but you have
no room for it!


Are you working
on a POKéDEX?

PROF.OAK's AIDE
came by here.


EXP.ALL gives
EXP points to all
the POKéMON with
you, even if they
don't fight.

It does, however,
reduce the amount
of EXP for each
POKéMON.

If you don't need
it, you should
store it via PC.


Looked into the
binoculars.

It looks like a
small island!


No pedestrians
are allowed on
CYCLING ROAD!


CYCLING ROAD is a
downhill course
by the sea. It's
a great ride.


Excuse me! Wait
up please!


How'd you get in?
Good effort!


I'm going for a
ride with my girl
friend!


We're going
riding together!


Looked into the
binoculars.

It's CELADON DEPT.
STORE!


Looked into the
binoculars.

There's a long
path over water!


Oh, you found my
secret retreat!

Please don't tell
anyone I'm here.
I'll make it up
to you with this!


NINTEN received
HM02!


HM02 is FLY.
It will take you
back to any town.

Put it to good
use!


You don't have any
room for this.


FEAROW: Kyueen!


You need a BICYCLE
for CYCLING ROAD!


CYCLING ROAD is
all uphill from
here.


Excuse me!


Looked into the
binoculars.

PALLET TOWN is in
the west!


Looked into the
binoculars.

There are people
swimming!


Only truly skilled
trainers are
allowed through.

You don't have the
BOULDERBADGE yet!


The rules are
rules. I can't
let you pass.


Oh! That is the
BOULDERBADGE!
Go right ahead!


Gyaoo!


VICTORY ROAD is
the final test
for trainers!


Aiyah!


If you get stuck,
try moving some
boulders around!


Ah, so you wish
to challenge the
ELITE FOUR?


You
got me!


SONY also came
through here!


Come on!
I'll whip you!


I got
whipped!


You earned the
right to be on
VICTORY ROAD!


If you can get
through here, you
can go meet the
ELITE FOUR!


No!
Unbelievable!


I can beat you
when it comes to
knowledge about
POKéMON!


Is VICTORY ROAD
too tough?


Well
done!


Many trainers give
up the challenge
here.


Hiya! I'm a
POKéMON...
...No I'm not!

Call me BILL!
I'm a true blue
POKéMANIAC! Hey!
What's with that
skeptical look?

I'm not joshing
you, I screwed up
an experiment and
got combined with
a POKéMON!

So, how about it?
Help me out here!


When I'm in the
TELEPORTER, go to
my PC and run the
Cell Separation
System!


No!? Come on, you
gotta help a guy
in deep trouble!

What do you say,
chief? Please?
OK? All right!


BILL: Yeehah!
Thanks, bud! I
owe you one!

So, did you come
to see my POKéMON
collection?
You didn't?
That's a bummer.

I've got to thank
you... Oh here,
maybe this'll do.


NINTEN received
an {4B}!


You've got too
much stuff, bud!


That cruise ship,
S.S.ANNE, is in
VERMILION CITY.
Its passengers
are all trainers!

They invited me
to their party,
but I can't stand
fancy do's. Why
don't you go
instead of me?


BILL: Look, bud,
just check out
some of my rare
POKéMON on my PC!


Hi! I work at a
POKéMON MART.

It's a convenient
shop, so please
visit us in
VIRIDIAN CITY.

I know, I'll give
you a sample!
Here you go!


NINTEN got
{4B}!


We also carry
POKé BALLs for
catching POKéMON!


You have too much
stuff with you!


See those ledges
along the road?

It's a bit scary,
but you can jump
from them.

You can get back
to PALLET TOWN
quicker that way.

CERULEAN takes a
lot out of you!


Hey! I met you in
VIRIDIAN FOREST!


You
beat me again!


There are other
kinds of POKéMON
than those found
in the forest!


Hi! I like shorts!
They're comfy and
easy to wear!


I don't
believe it!


Are you storing
your POKéMON on
PC? Each BOX can
hold 20 POKéMON!


You looked at me,
didn't you?


You're
mean!


Quit staring if
you don't want to
fight!


Are you a trainer?
Let's fight!


If I
had new POKéMON I
would've won!


If a POKéMON BOX
on the PC gets
full, just switch
to another BOX!


That look you
gave me, it's so
intriguing!


Be nice!


Avoid fights by
not letting
people see you!


Hey! You're not
wearing shorts!


Lost!
Lost! Lost!


I always wear
shorts, even in
winter!


You can fight my
new POKéMON!


Done

Trained POKéMON
are stronger than
the wild ones!


Eek! Did you

That's it?

There aren't many
bugs out here.


No!
You're kidding!


I like bugs, so
I'm going back to
VIRIDIAN FOREST.


Huh? You want
to talk to me?


I
didn't start it!


I should carry
more POKéMON with
me for safety.


Me? Well, OK.
I'll play!


Just
didn't work!


I want to get

I've never seen

Lady Luck's not

It's
not logical!


Go with GRIMER
first...and...
...and...then...


I like NIDORAN, so
I collect them!


Why? Why??


When POKéMON grow
up they get ugly!
They shouldn't
evolve!


School is fun, but
so are POKéMON.


I'll

We're stuck here

Gambling and
POKéMON are like
eating peanuts!
Just can't stop!

lost each time.


Ohh!
Blew it again!


I noticed some
POKéMANIACs
prowling around.


Ah! This mountain
air is delicious!


That
cleared my head!


I feel bloated on
mountain air!


I'm feeling a bit
faint from this
tough hike.


I'm

The POKéMON here

Careful!

That

Luck of the draw!
Just luck!


I have never won
before...


I saw
this coming...


It's just luck.
Luck of the draw.


I'm the best in
my class!


Darn!
I need to make my
POKéMON stronger!


There's a fat
POKéMON that
comes down from
the mountains.

It's strong if
you can get it.


Watch out for
live wires!


Whoa!
You spark plug!


Well, better get
back to work.


My POKéMON should
be ready by now!


Too
much, too young!


I better go find
stronger ones!

SNORLAX woke up!

SNORLAX calmed

Yeah! I got a
bite, here!


Tch!
Just a small fry!


Hang on! My line's
snagged!


Be patient!
Fishing is a
waiting game!


That
one got away!


With a better ROD,
I could catch
better POKéMON!


Have you found a
MOON STONE?


Oww!


I could have made
my POKéMON evolve
with MOON STONE!


Electricity is my

It's

It's all right.
Losing doesn't

You got those

I'm beat. I guess
I'll FLY home.


Sure, I'll play

Oh!
You little brute!


I wonder which is

female POKéMON?


Do you want to

I don't know

ROUTE 13
North to SILENCE
BRIDGE


You need to use
TMs to teach good
moves to POKéMON!


Not
good enough!


You have some HMs
right? POKéMON
can't ever forget
those moves.


My bird POKéMON
should be ready
for battle.


Not
ready yet!


They need to learn
better moves.


TMs are on sale
in CELADON!
But, only a few
people have HMs!


Aww,
bummer!


Teach POKéMON
moves of the same
element type for
more power.


Have you taught
your bird POKéMON
how to FLY?


Shot
down in flames!


Bird POKéMON are
my true love!


Have you heard of
the legendary
POKéMON?


Why?
Why'd I lose?


The 3 legendary
POKéMON are all
birds of prey.


I'm not into it,
but OK! Let's go!


I
knew it!


Winning, losing,
it doesn't matter
in the long run!


C'mon, c'mon.
Let's go, let's
go, let's go!


Arrg!
Lost! Get lost!


What, what, what?
What do you want?


Perfect! I need to
burn some time!


What?
You!?


Raising POKéMON
is a drag, man.


We ride out here
because there's
more room!


Wipe out!


It's cool you
made your POKéMON
so strong!

Might is right!
And you know it!


POKéMON fight?
Cool! Rumble!


Blown
away!


You know who'd
win, you and me
one on one!


ROUTE 14
West to FUCHSIA
CITY


Let me try out the
POKéMON I just
got in a trade!


Not
good enough!


You can't change
the nickname of
any POKéMON you
get in a trade.

Only the Original
Trainer can.


You look gentle,
so I think I can
beat you!


No,
wrong!


I'm afraid of
BIKERs, they look
so ugly and mean!


When I whistle, I
can summon bird
POKéMON!


Ow!
That's tragic!


Maybe I'm not cut
out for battles.


Hmm? My birds are
shivering! You're
good, aren't you?


Just
as I thought!


Did you know moves
like EARTHQUAKE
don't have any
effect on birds?


Oh, you're a
little cutie!


You looked
so cute too!


I forgive you!
I can take it!


I raise POKéMON
because I live
alone!


I didn't
ask for this!


I just like going
home to be with
my POKéMON!


Hey kid! C'mon!
I just got these!


Why
not?


You only live
once, so I live
as an outlaw!
TEAM ROCKET RULES!


Fork over all your
cash when you
lose to me, kid!


That
can't be true!


I was just joking
about the money!


What's cool?
Trading POKéMON!


I
said trade!


I trade POKéMON
with my friends!


Want to play with
my POKéMON?


I was
too impatient!


I'll go train with
weaker people.


ROUTE 15
West to FUCHSIA
CITY


What do you want?


Don't you
dare laugh!


We like just
hanging here,
what's it to you?


Nice BIKE!
Hand it over!


Knock
out!


Forget it, who
needs your BIKE!


Come out and play,
little mouse!


You
little rat!


I hate losing!
Get away from me!


Hey, you just
bumped me!


Kaboom!


You can also get
to FUCHSIA from
VERMILION using a
coastal road.


I'm feeling
hungry and mean!


Bad,
bad, bad!


I like my POKéMON
ferocious! They
tear up enemies!


Sure, I'll go!


Don't make
me mad!


I like harassing
people with my
vicious POKéMON!


A sleeping POKéMON
blocks the way!


SNORLAX woke up!

It attacked in a
grumpy rage!


With a big yawn,
SNORLAX returned
to the mountains!


Enjoy the slope!
CYCLING ROAD


ROUTE 16
CELADON CITY -
FUCHSIA CITY


There's no money
in fighting kids!


Burned
out!


Good stuff is
lying around on
CYCLING ROAD!


What do you want,
kiddo?


Whoo!


I could belly-
bump you outta
here!


You heading to
FUCHSIA?


Crash and
burn!


I love racing
downhill!


We're BIKERs!
Highway stars!


Smoked!


Are you looking
for adventure?


Let VOLTORB
electrify you!


Grounded
out!


I got my VOLTORB
at the abandoned
POWER PLANT.


My POKéMON won't
evolve! Why?


Why,
you!


Maybe some POKéMON
need element
STONEs to evolve.


I need a little
exercise!


Whew!
Good workout!


I'm sure I lost
weight there!


Be a rebel!


Aaaargh!


Be ready to fight
for your beliefs!


Nice BIKE!
How's it handle?


Shoot!


The slope makes
it hard to steer!


Get lost kid!
I'm bushed!


Are you
satisfied?


I need to catch
a few Zs!


It's a notice!

Watch out for
discarded items!


TRAINER TIPS

All POKéMON are
unique.

Even POKéMON of
the same type and
level grow at
different rates.


TRAINER TIPS

Press the A or B
Button to stay in
place while on a
slope.


ROUTE 17
CELADON CITY -
FUCHSIA CITY


It's a notice!

Don't throw the
game, throw POKé
BALLs instead!


CYCLING ROAD
Slope ends here!


I always check
every grassy area
for new POKéMON.


Tch!


I wish I had a
BIKE!


Kurukkoo!
How do you like
my bird call?


I
had to bug you!


I also collect sea
POKéMON on
weekends!


This is my turf!
Get out of here!


Darn!


This is my fave
POKéMON hunting
area!


ROUTE 18
CELADON CITY -
FUCHSIA CITY


CYCLING ROAD
No pedestrians
permitted!


Have to warm up
before my swim!


All
warmed up!


Thanks, kid! I'm
ready for a swim!


Wait! You'll have
a heart attack!


Ooh!
That's chilly!


Watch out for
TENTACOOL!


I love swimming!
What about you?


Belly
flop!


I can beat POKéMON
at swimming!


What's beyond the
horizon?


Glub!


I see a couple of
islands!


I tried diving
for POKéMON, but
it was a no go!


Help!


You have to fish
for sea POKéMON!


I look at the
sea to forget!


Ooh!
Traumatic!


I'm looking at the
sea to forget!


Oh, I just love
your ride! Can I
have it if I win?


Oh!
I lost!


It's still a long
way to go to
SEAFOAM ISLANDS.


Swimming's great!
Sunburns aren't!


Shocker!


My boy friend
wanted to swim to
SEAFOAM ISLANDS.


These waters are
treacherous!


Ooh!
Dangerous!


I got a cramp!
Glub, glub...


I swam here, but
I'm tired.


I'm
exhausted...


LAPRAS is so big,
it must keep you
dry on water.


SEA ROUTE 19
FUCHSIA CITY -
SEAFOAM ISLANDS


The water is
shallow here.


Splash!


I wish I could
ride my POKéMON.


SEAFOAM is a
quiet getaway!


Quit it!


There's a huge
cavern underneath
this island.


I love floating
with the fishes!


Yowch!


Want to float
with me?


Are you on
vacation too?


No
mercy at all!


SEAFOAM used to
be one island!


Check out my buff
physique!


Wimpy!


I should've been
buffing up my
POKéMON, not me!


Why are you
riding a POKéMON?
Can't you swim?


Ouch!
Torpedoed!


Riding a POKéMON
sure looks fun!


I rode my bird
POKéMON here!


Oh
no!


My birds can't
FLY me back!


My boy friend gave
me big pearls!


Don't
touch my pearls!


Will my pearls
grow bigger
inside CLOYSTER?


I swam here from
CINNABAR ISLAND!


I'm
so disappointed!


POKéMON have
taken over an
abandoned mansion
on CINNABAR!


CINNABAR, in the
west, has a LAB
for POKéMON.


Wait!


CINNABAR is a
volcanic island!


SEAFOAM ISLANDS


You want to know
if the fish are
biting?


Dang!


I can't catch
anything good!


I got a big haul!
Wanna go for it?


Darn
MAGIKARP!


I seem to only
catch MAGIKARP!


The sea cleanses
my body and soul!


Ayah!


I like the
mountains too!


What's wrong with
me swimming?


Cheap
shot!


I look like what?
A studded inner
tube? Get lost!


I caught all my
POKéMON at sea!


Diver!!
Down!!


Where'd you catch
your POKéMON?


Right now, I'm in
a triathlon meet!


Pant...
pant...pant...


I'm beat!
But, I still have
the bike race and
marathon left!


Ahh! Feel the sun
and the wind!


Yow!
I lost!


I'm sunburnt to a
crisp!


Hey, don't scare
away the fish!


Sorry!
I didn't mean it!


I was just angry
that I couldn't
catch anything.


Keep me company
'til I get a hit!


That
burned some time.


Oh wait! I got a
bite! Yeah!


SONY: Hey!
NINTEN!

You're going to
POKéMON LEAGUE?

Forget it! You
probably don't
have any BADGEs!

The guard won't
let you through!

By the way, did
your POKéMON
get any stronger?


I heard POKéMON
LEAGUE has many
tough trainers!

I have to figure
out how to get
past them!

You should quit
dawdling and get
a move on!


Awww!
You just lucked
out!


SONY: What?
Why do I have 2
POKéMON?

You should catch
some more too!


SONY: What?
NINTEN! What a
surprise to see
you here!

So you're going to
POKéMON LEAGUE?

You collected all
the BADGEs too?
That's cool!

Then I'll whip you
NINTEN as a
warm up for
POKéMON LEAGUE!

Come on!


That loosened me
up! I'm ready for
POKéMON LEAGUE!

NINTEN, you need
more practice!

But hey, you know
that! I'm out of
here. Smell ya!


What!?

I was just
careless!


SONY: Hahaha!
NINTEN! That's
your best? You're
nowhere near as
good as me, pal!

Go train some
more! You loser!

VICTORY ROAD GATE
- POKéMON LEAGUE


Congratulations!
You beat our 5
contest trainers!


You just earned a
fabulous prize!


NINTEN received
a {4B}!


You don't have
any room!


By the way, would
you like to join
TEAM ROCKET?

We're a group
dedicated to evil
using POKéMON!

Want to join?

Are you sure?

Come on, join us!

I'm telling you
to join!

OK, you need
convincing!

I'll make you an
offer you can't
refuse!


Arrgh!
You are good!


With your ability,
you could become
a top leader in
TEAM ROCKET!


I saw your feat
from the grass!


I
thought not!


I hid because the
people on the
bridge scared me!


OK! I'm No. 5!
I'll stomp you!


Whoa!
Too much!


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


I'm No. 4!
Getting tired?


I lost
too!


I did my best, so
I've no regrets!


Here's No. 3!
I won't be easy!


Ow!
Stomped flat!


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


I'm second!
Now it's serious!


How could I
lose?


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


This is NUGGET
BRIDGE! Beat us 5
trainers and win
a fabulous prize!

Think you got
what it takes?


Whoo!
Good stuff!


I did my best, I
have no regrets!


Local trainers
come here to
practice!


You're
decent.


All POKéMON have
weaknesses. It's
best to raise
different kinds.


Dad took me to a
great party on
S.S.ANNE at
VERMILION CITY!


I'm
not mad!


On S.S.ANNE, I
saw trainers from
around the world.


I'm a cool guy.
I've got a girl
friend!


Aww,
darn...


Oh well. My girl
will cheer me up.


Hi! My boy
friend is cool!


I was in
bad condition!


I wish my guy was
as good as you!


I knew I had to
fight you!


I knew
I'd lose too!


If your POKéMON
gets confused or
falls asleep,
switch it!


My friend has a
cute POKéMON.
I'm so jealous!


I'm
not so jealous!


You came from MT.
MOON? May I have
a CLEFAIRY?


I just got down
from MT.MOON,
but I'm ready!


You
worked hard!


Drat!
A ZUBAT bit me
back in there.


I'm off to see a
POKéMON collector
at the cape!


You
got me.


The collector has
many rare kinds
of POKéMON.


You're going to
see BILL? First,
let's fight!


You're
something.


The trail below
is a shortcut to
CERULEAN CITY.


SEA COTTAGE
BILL lives here!


The file data is
destroyed!


Would you like to
SAVE the game?


NINTEN saved
the game!


The older file
will be erased to
save. Okay?


When you change a
POKéMON BOX, data
will be saved.

Is that okay?


Choose a
{*PK*MN*} BOX.

MOM: Right.
All boys leave
home some day.
It said so on TV.

PROF.OAK, next
door, is looking
for you.


MOM: NINTEN!
You should take a
quick rest.


MOM: Oh good!
You and your
POKéMON are
looking great!
Take care now!


There's a movie
on TV. Four boys
are walking on
railroad tracks.

I better go too.


Oops, wrong side.


Hi NINTEN!
SONY is out at
Grandpa's lab.


Grandpa asked you
to run an errand?
Here, this will
help you!


NINTEN got a
{4B}!


You have too much
stuff with you.


Use the TOWN MAP
to find out where
you are.


POKéMON are living
things! If they
get tired, give
them a rest!


It's a big map!
This is useful!


SONY: Yo
NINTEN! Gramps
isn't around!


SONY: Heh, I
don't need to be
greedy like you!

Go ahead and
choose, NINTEN!


SONY: My
POKéMON looks a
lot stronger.


Those are POKé
BALLs. They
contain POKéMON!


So! You want the
fire POKéMON,
CHARMANDER?


So! You want the
water POKéMON,
SQUIRTLE?


So! You want the
plant POKéMON,
BULBASAUR?


This POKéMON is
really energetic!


NINTEN received
a {6D}!


That's PROF.OAK's
last POKéMON!


OAK: Now, NINTEN,
which POKéMON do
you want?


OAK: If a wild
POKéMON appears,
your POKéMON can
fight against it!


OAK: NINTEN,
raise your young
POKéMON by making
it fight!


OAK: Oh, NINTEN!

How is my old
POKéMON?

Well, it seems to
like you a lot.

You must be
talented as a
POKéMON trainer!

What? You have
something for me?

NINTEN delivered
OAK's PARCEL.


Ah! This is the
custom POKé BALL
I ordered!
Thank you!


POKéMON around the
world wait for
you, NINTEN!


OAK: You can't get
detailed data on
POKéMON by just
seeing them.

You must catch
them! Use these
to capture wild
POKéMON.

NINTEN got 5
POKé BALLs!


When a wild
POKéMON appears,
it's fair game.

Just throw a POKé
BALL at it and try
to catch it!

This won't always
work, though.

A healthy POKéMON
could escape. You
have to be lucky!


OAK: Come see me
sometimes.

I want to know how
your POKéDEX is
coming along.


OAK: Good to see
you! How is your
POKéDEX coming?
Here, let me take
a look!


It's encyclopedia-
like, but the
pages are blank!


?


PROF.OAK is the
authority on
POKéMON!

Many POKéMON
trainers hold him
in high regard!


SONY: Gramps!
I'm fed up with
waiting!


OAK: SONY?
Let me think...

Oh, that's right,
I told you to
come! Just wait!

Here, NINTEN!

There are 3
POKéMON here!

Haha!

They are inside
the POKé BALLs.

When I was young,
I was a serious
POKéMON trainer!

In my old age, I
have only 3 left,
but you can have
one! Choose!


SONY: Hey!
Gramps! What
about me?


OAK: Be patient!
SONY, you can
have one too!


OAK: Hey! Don't go
away yet!


SONY: I'll take
this one, then!


SONY received
a {6D}!


SONY: Wait
NINTEN!
Let's check out
our POKéMON!

Come on, I'll take
you on!


WHAT?
Unbelievable!
I picked the
wrong POKéMON!


SONY: Yeah! Am
I great or what?


SONY: Okay!
I'll make my
POKéMON fight to
toughen it up!

NINTEN! Gramps!
Smell you later!


SONY: Gramps!


SONY: What did
you call me for?


OAK: Oh right! I
have a request
of you two.


On the desk there
is my invention,
POKéDEX!

It automatically
records data on
POKéMON you've
seen or caught!

It's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!


OAK: NINTEN and
SONY! Take
these with you!

NINTEN got
POKéDEX from OAK!


To make a complete
guide on all the
POKéMON in the
world...

That was my dream!

But, I'm too old!
I can't do it!

So, I want you two
to fulfill my
dream for me!

Get moving, you
two!

This is a great
undertaking in
POKéMON history!


SONY: Alright
Gramps! Leave it
all to me!

NINTEN, I hate to
say it, but I
don't need you!

I know! I'll
borrow a TOWN MAP
from my sis!

I'll tell her not
to lend you one,
NINTEN! Hahaha!


I study POKéMON as
PROF.OAK's AIDE.


POKéDEX comp-
letion is:

{FF} POKéMON seen
{FF} POKéMON owned

PROF.OAK's
Rating:


You still have
lots to do.
Look for POKéMON
in grassy areas!


You're on the
right track!
Get a FLASH HM
from my AIDE!


You still need
more POKéMON!
Try to catch
other species!


Good, you're
trying hard!
Get an ITEMFINDER
from my AIDE!


Looking good!
Go find my AIDE
when you get 50!


You finally got at
least 50 species!
Be sure to get
EXP.ALL from my
AIDE!


Ho! This is geting
even better!


Very good!
Go fish for some
marine POKéMON!


Wonderful!
Do you like to
collect things?


I'm impressed!
It must have been
difficult to do!


You finally got at
least 100 species!
I can't believe
how good you are!


You even have the
evolved forms of
POKéMON! Super!


Excellent! Trade
with friends to
get some more!


Outstanding!
You've become a
real pro at this!


I have nothing
left to say!
You're the
authority now!


Your POKéDEX is
entirely complete!
Congratulations!


You can use that
PC in the corner.

The receptionist
told me. So kind!


There's a POKéMON
CENTER in every
town ahead.

They don't charge
any money either!


Okay! Say hi to
PROF.OAK for me!


Hey! You came from
PALLET TOWN?


You know PROF.
OAK, right?

His order came in.
Will you take it
to him?

NINTEN got
OAK's PARCEL!


This shop sells
many ANTIDOTEs.


No! POTIONs are
all sold out.


Whew! I'm trying
to memorize all
my notes.


Okay!

Be sure to read
the blackboard
carefully!


Coming up with
nicknames is fun,
but hard.

Simple names are
the easiest to
remember.


My Daddy loves
POKéMON too.


SPEARY: Tetweet!


SPEAROW
Name: SPEARY


Fwahahaha! This is
my hideout!

I planned to
resurrect TEAM
ROCKET here!

But, you have
caught me again!
So be it! This
time, I'm not
holding back!

Once more, you
shall face
GIOVANNI, the
greatest trainer!


Ha!
That was a truly
intense fight!
You have won!
As proof, here is
the EARTHBADGE!


Having lost, I
cannot face my
underlings!
TEAM ROCKET is
finished forever!

I will dedicate my
life to the study
of POKéMON!

Let us meet again
some day!
Farewell!


The EARTHBADGE
makes POKéMON of
any level obey!

It is evidence of
your mastery as a
POKéMON trainer!

With it, you can
enter the POKéMON
LEAGUE!

It is my gift for
your POKéMON
LEAGUE challenge!


NINTEN received
TM27!


TM27 is FISSURE!
It will take out
POKéMON with just
one hit!

I made it when I
ran the GYM here,
too long ago...


You do not have
space for this!


Heh! You must be
running out of
steam by now!


I
ran out of gas!


You need power to
keep up with our
GYM LEADER!


Rrrroar! I'm
working myself
into a rage!


Wargh!


I'm still not
worthy!


POKéMON and I, we
make wonderful
music together!


You are in
perfect harmony!


Do you know the
identity of our
GYM LEADER?


Karate is the
ultimate form of
martial arts!


Atcho!


If my POKéMON
were as good at
Karate as I...


The truly talented
win with style!


I
lost my grip!


The LEADER will
scold me!


I'm the KARATE
KING! Your fate
rests with me!


Ayah!


POKéMON LEAGUE?
You? Don't get
cocky!


Your POKéMON will
cower at the
crack of my whip!


Yowch!
Whiplash!


Wait! I was just
careless!


VIRIDIAN GYM was
closed for a long
time, but now our
LEADER is back!


I
was beaten?


You can go onto
POKéMON LEAGUE
only by defeating
our GYM LEADER!


Yo! Champ in
making!

Even I don't know
VIRIDIAN LEADER's
identity!

This will be the
toughest of all
the GYM LEADERs!

I heard that the
trainers here
like ground-type
POKéMON!


Blow me away!
GIOVANNI was the
GYM LEADER here?


Come again!


It's ¥50 for a
child's ticket.

Would you like to
come in?


Right, ¥50!
Thank you!


You don't have
enough money.


You can't sneak
in the back way!

Oh, whatever!
Do you know what
AMBER is?


There's a lab
somewhere trying
to resurrect
ancient POKéMON
from AMBER.


AMBER is fossil-
ized tree sap.


Please go to the
other side!


Take plenty of
time to look!


That is one
magnificent
fossil!


Ssh! I think that
this chunk of
AMBER contains
POKéMON DNA!

It would be great
if POKéMON could
be resurrected
from it!

But, my colleagues
just ignore me!

So I have a favor
to ask!

Take this to a
POKéMON LAB and
get it examined!


NINTEN received
OLD AMBER!


Ssh! Get the OLD
AMBER checked!


You don't have
space for this!


We are proud of 2
fossils of very
rare, prehistoric
POKéMON!


The AMBER is
clear and gold!


MOON STONE?

What's so special
about it?


July 20, 1969!

The 1st lunar
landing!

I bought a color
TV to watch it!


We have a space
exhibit now.


I want a PIKACHU!
It's so cute!

I asked my Daddy
to catch me one!


Yeah, a PIKACHU
soon, I promise!


SPACE SHUTTLE
COLUMBIA


Meteorite that
fell on MT.MOON.
(MOON STONE?)


I'm BROCK!
I'm PEWTER's GYM
LEADER!

I believe in rock
hard defense and
determination!

That's why my
POKéMON are all
the rock-type!

Do you still want
to challenge me?
Fine then! Show
me your best!


There are all
kinds of trainers
in the world!

You appear to be
very gifted as a
POKéMON trainer!

Go to the GYM in
CERULEAN and test
your abilities!


Wait! Take this
with you!


NINTEN received
TM34!


A TM contains a
technique that
can be taught to
POKéMON!

A TM is good only
once! So when you
use one to teach
a new technique,
pick the POKéMON
carefully!

TM34 contains
BIDE!

Your POKéMON will
absorb damage in
battle then pay
it back double!


You don't have
room for this!


I took
you for granted.

As proof of your
victory, here's
the BOULDERBADGE!

NINTEN received
the BOULDERBADGE!


That's an official
POKéMON LEAGUE
BADGE!

Its bearer's
POKéMON become
more powerful!

The technique
FLASH can now be
used any time!


Stop right there,
kid!

You're still light
years from facing
BROCK!


Darn!

Light years isn't
time! It measures
distance!


You're pretty hot,
but not as hot
as BROCK!


Hiya! I can tell
you have what it
takes to become a
POKéMON champ!

I'm no trainer,
but I can tell
you how to win!

Let me take you
to the top!


All right! Let's
get happening!


The 1st POKéMON
out in a match is
at the top of the
POKéMON LIST!

By changing the
order of POKéMON,
matches could be
made easier!


It's a free
service! Let's
get happening!


Just as I thought!
You're POKéMON
champ material!


NIDORAN: Bowbow!


NIDORAN sit!


Our POKéMON's an
outsider, so it's
hard to handle.

An outsider is a
POKéMON that you
get in a trade.

It grows fast, but
it may ignore an
unskilled trainer
in battle!

If only we had
some BADGEs...


A shady, old man
got me to buy
this really weird
fish POKéMON!

It's totally weak
and it cost ¥500!


Good things can
happen if you
raise POKéMON
diligently, even
the weak ones!


POKéMON learn new
techniques as
they grow!

But, some moves
must be taught by
the trainer!


POKéMON become
easier to catch
when they are
hurt or asleep!

But, it's not a
sure thing!


What!?

TEAM ROCKET is
at MT.MOON? Huh?
I'm on the phone!

Scram!


JIGGLYPUFF: Puu
pupuu!


Those miserable
ROCKETs!

Look what they
did here!

They stole a TM
for teaching
POKéMON how to
DIG holes!

That cost me a
bundle, it did!


I figure what's
lost is lost!

I decided to teach
DIGLETT how to
DIG without a TM!


TEAM ROCKET must
be trying to DIG
their way into no
good!


TEAM ROCKET left
a way out!


My husband likes
trading POKéMON.

If you are a
collector, would
you please trade
with him?


That BILL!

I heard that
he'll do whatever
it takes to get
rare POKéMON!


Have you heard
about BILL?

Everyone calls
him a POKéMANIAC!

I think people
are just jealous
of BILL, though.

Who wouldn't want
to boast about
their POKéMON?


Hi, you're a new
face!

Trainers who want
to turn pro have
to have a policy
about POKéMON!

What is your
approach when you
catch POKéMON?

My policy is an
all-out offensive
with water-type
POKéMON!


TM11 teaches
BUBBLEBEAM!

Use it on an
aquatic POKéMON!


The CASCADEBADGE
makes all POKéMON
up to L30 obey!

That includes
even outsiders!

There's more, you
can now use CUT
any time!

You can CUT down
small bushes to
open new paths!

You can also have
my favorite TM!


NINTEN received
TM11!


You better make
room for this!


Wow!
You're too much!

All right!

You can have the
CASCADEBADGE to
show you beat me!


I'm more than good
enough for you!

MISTY can wait!


You
overwhelmed me!


You have to face
other trainers to
find out how good
you really are.


Splash!

I'm first up!
Let's do it!


That
can't be!


MISTY is going to
keep improving!

She won't lose to
someone like you!


Yo! Champ in
making!

Here's my advice!

The LEADER, MISTY,
is a pro who uses
water POKéMON!

You can drain all
their water with
plant POKéMON!

Or, zap them with
electricity!


You beat MISTY!
What'd I tell ya?

You and me kid,
we make a pretty
darn good team!


Hi! Welcome to
our BIKE SHOP.

Have we got just
the BIKE for you!


It's a cool BIKE!
Do you want it?


Sorry! You can't
afford it!


Oh, that's...

A BIKE VOUCHER!

OK! Here you go!


NINTEN exchanged
the BIKE VOUCHER
for a BICYCLE.


Come back again
some time!


How do you like
your new BICYCLE?

You can take it
on CYCLING ROAD
and in caves!


You better make
room for this!


A plain city BIKE
is good enough
for me!

You can't put a
shopping basket
on an MTB!


These BIKEs are
cool, but they're
way expensive!


Wow. Your BIKE is
really cool!


Use REPEL to keep
bugs and weak
POKéMON away.

Put your strongest
POKéMON at the
top of the list
for best results!


Have you seen any
RARE CANDY?

It's supposed to
make POKéMON go
up one level!


POKéMON BADGEs
are owned only by
skilled trainers.

I see you have
at least one.

Those BADGEs have
amazing secrets!


Now then...

Which of the 8
BADGEs should I
describe?


Come visit me any
time you wish.


The ATTACK of all
POKéMON increases
a little bit.

It also lets you
use FLASH any
time you desire.


POKéMON up to L30
will obey you.

Any higher, they
become unruly!

It also lets you
use CUT outside
of battle.


The SPEED of all
POKéMON increases
a little bit.

It also lets you
use FLY outside
of battle.


POKéMON up to L50
will obey you.

Any higher, they
become unruly!

It also lets you
use STRENGTH out-
side of battle.


The DEFENSE of all
POKéMON increases
a little bit.

It also lets you
use SURF outside
of battle.


POKéMON up to L70
will obey you.

Any higher, they
become unruly!


Your POKéMON's
SPECIAL abilities
increase a bit.


All POKéMON will
obey you!


TEAM ROCKET will
do anything for
the sake of gold!


I saw CUBONE's
mother die trying
to escape from
TEAM ROCKET!


POKéMON TOWER was
erected in the
memory of POKéMON
that had died.


Did you come to
pay respects?
Bless you!


I came to pray
for my CLEFAIRY.

Sniff! I can't
stop crying...


My GROWLITHE...
Why did you die?


I am a CHANNELER!
There are spirits
up to mischief!


SONY: Hey,
NINTEN! What
brings you here?
Your POKéMON
don't look dead!

I can at least
make them faint!
Let's go, pal!


What?
You stinker!

I took it easy on
you too!


SONY: Well,
look at all your
wimpy POKéMON!

Toughen them up a
bit more!


How's your POKéDEX
coming, pal?
I just caught a
CUBONE!

I can't find the
grown-up MAROWAK
yet!

I doubt there are
any left! Well, I
better get going!
I've got a lot to
accomplish, pal!

Smell ya later!


Even we could not
identify the
wayward GHOSTs!

A SILPH SCOPE
might be able to
unmask them.


Urrg...Awaa...
Huhu...graa..


Hwa!
I'm saved!


The GHOSTs can be
identified by the
SILPH SCOPE.


Kekeke....
Kwaaah!


Hmm?
What am I doing?


Sorry! I was
possessed!


Be gone!
Evil spirit!


Whew!
The spirit left!


My friends were
possessed too!


GHOST! No!
Kwaaah!


Where
is the GHOST?


I must have been
dreaming...


Be cursed with
me! Kwaaah!


What!


We can't crack
the identity of
the GHOSTs.


Huhuhu...
Beat me not!


Huh?
Who? What?


May the departed
souls of POKéMON
rest in peace...


Come, child! I
sealed this space
with white magic!

You can rest here!


Give...me...
your...soul...


Gasp!


I was under
possession!


You...shall...
join...us...


What
a nightmare!


I was possessed!


Zombies!


Ha?


I regained my
senses!


Urgah...
Urff....


Whoo!


I fell to evil
spirits despite
my training!


Entered purified,
protected zone!

NINTEN's POKéMON
are fully healed!


The GHOST was the
restless soul of
CUBONE's mother!


The mother's soul
was calmed.

It departed to
the afterlife!


Give...me...
blood...


Groan!


I feel anemic and
weak...


Urff... Kwaah!


Some-
thing fell out!


Hair didn't fall
out! It was an
evil spirit!


Ke..ke...ke...
ke..ke...ke!!


Keee!


What's going on
here?


Be gone...
Intruders...


MR.FUJI: Heh? You
came to save me?

Thank you. But, I
came here of my
own free will.

I came to calm
the soul of
CUBONE's mother.

I think MAROWAK's
spirit has gone
to the afterlife.

I must thank you
for your kind
concern!

Follow me to my
home, POKéMON
HOUSE at the foot
of this tower.


What do you want?
Why are you here?


I give up!


I'm not going to
forget this!


This old guy came
and complained
about us harming
useless POKéMON!

We're talking it
over as adults!


Please!
No more!


POKéMON are only
good for making
money!

Stay out of our
business!


You're not saving
anyone, kid!


Don't
fight us ROCKETs!


You're not getting
away with this!


That's odd, MR.FUJI
isn't here.
Where'd he go?


MR.FUJI had been
praying alone for
CUBONE's mother.


This is really
MR.FUJI's house.

He's really kind!

He looks after
abandoned and
orphaned POKéMON!


It's so warm!
POKéMON are so
nice to hug!


PSYDUCK: Gwappa!


NIDORINO: Gaoo!


MR.FUJI: NINTEN.

Your POKéDEX quest
may fail without
love for your
POKéMON.

I think this may
help your quest.


NINTEN received

Upon hearing POKé
FLUTE, sleeping

I'm searching for
items that raise
the abilities of
POKéMON during a
single battle.

X ATTACK, X
DEFEND, X SPEED
and X SPECIAL are
what I'm after.

Do you know where
I can get them?


You know REVIVE?
It revives any
fainted POKéMON!


I found a NUGGET
in the mountains.

I thought it was
useless, but it
sold for ¥5000!


CUBONE: Kyarugoo!


I hate those
horrible ROCKETs!

That poor CUBONE's
mother...

It was killed
trying to escape
from TEAM ROCKET!


The GHOST of
POKéMON TOWER is
gone!

Someone must have
soothed its
restless soul!


Hello, hello!
I am the official
NAME RATER!

Want me to rate
the nicknames of
your POKéMON?


Which POKéMON
should I look at?


{6D} , is it?
That is a decent
nickname!

But, would you
like me to give
it a nicer name?

How about it?


Fine! What should
we name it?


OK! This POKéMON
has been renamed
{E9}!

That's a better
name than before!


Fine! Come any
time you like!


{6D}, is it?
That is a truly
impeccable name!

Take good care of
{6D}!


Even if they are
the same level,
POKéMON can have
very different
abilities.

A POKéMON raised
by a trainer is
stronger than one
in the wild.


My POKéMON was
poisoned! It
fainted while we
were walking!


Won't you admire
my PIKACHU's
adorable tail?


Humph! My PIKACHU
is twice as cute
as that one!


I just love my
SEEL!

It squeals when I
hug it!


Oh dear!

My SEEL is far
more attractive!


PIKACHU: Chu!
Pikachu!


SEEL: Kyuoo!


I chair the
POKéMON Fan Club!

I have collected
over 100 POKéMON!

I'm very fussy

POKéMON!

So...

Did you come
visit to hear
about my POKéMON?


Good!
Then listen up!

My favorite
RAPIDASH...

It...cute...
lovely...smart...
plus...amazing...
you think so?...
oh yes...it...
stunning...
kindly...
love it!

Hug it...when...

spectacular...
ravishing...
...Oops! Look at
the time! I kept
you too long!

Thanks for hearing
me out! I want
you to have this!


NINTEN received
a {4B}!


Exchange that for
a BICYCLE!

Don't worry, my
FEAROW will FLY
me anywhere!

So, I don't need a
BICYCLE!

I hope you like
cycling!


Oh. Come back
when you want to
hear my story!


Hello, NINTEN!

Did you come see
me about my
POKéMON again?

No? Too bad!


Make room for
this!


Our Chairman is
very vocal about
POKéMON.


Let's all listen
politely to other
trainers!


If someone brags,
brag right back!


There are evil
people who will
use POKéMON for
criminal acts.

TEAM ROCKET
traffics in rare
POKéMON.

They also abandon
POKéMON that they
consider not to
be popular or
useful.


I think POKéMON
can be good or
evil. It depends
on the trainer.


Hey, kid! What do
you think you're
doing here?

You won't live
long in combat!
That's for sure!

I tell you kid,
electric POKéMON
saved me during
the war!

They zapped my
enemies into
paralysis!

The same as I'll
do to you!


A little word of
advice, kid!

Electricity is
sure powerful!

But, it's useless
against ground-
type POKéMON!


The THUNDERBADGE
cranks up your
POKéMON's SPEED!

It also lets your
POKéMON FLY any
time, kid!

You're special,
kid! Take this!


NINTEN received
{4B}!


TM24 contains
THUNDERBOLT!

Teach it to an
electric POKéMON!


Yo kid, make room
in your pack!


Whoa!

You're the real
deal, kid!

Fine then, take
the THUNDERBADGE!


When I was in the
Army, LT.SURGE
was my strict CO!


Stop!
You're very good!


The door won't
open?

LT.SURGE always
was cautious!


I'm a lightweight,
but I'm good with
electricity!


Fried!


OK, I'll talk!

LT.SURGE said he
hid door switches
inside something!


This is no place
for kids!


Wow!
Surprised me!


LT.SURGE set up
double locks!
Here's a hint!

When you open the
1st lock, the 2nd
lock is right
next to it!


Yo! Champ in
making!

LT.SURGE has a
nickname. People
refer to him as
the Lightning
American!

He's an expert on
electric POKéMON!

Birds and water
POKéMON are at
risk! Beware of
paralysis too!

LT.SURGE is very
cautious!

You'll have to
break a code to
get to him!


Whew! That match
was electric!


I'm getting my
PIDGEY to fly a

I rode uphill on
CYCLING ROAD from
FUCHSIA!


Hello. Lovely
weather isn't it?
It's so pleasant.

...Oh dear...
I must have dozed
off. Welcome.

My name is ERIKA.
I am the LEADER
of CELADON GYM.

I teach the art of
flower arranging.
My POKéMON are of
the grass-type.

Oh, I'm sorry, I
had no idea that
you wished to
challenge me.

Very well, but I
shall not lose.


Oh!
I concede defeat.

You are remarkably
strong.

I must confer you
the RAINBOWBADGE.


You are cataloging
POKéMON? I must
say I'm impressed.

I would never
collect POKéMON
if they were
unattractive.


The RAINBOWBADGE
will make POKéMON
up to L50 obey.

It also allows
POKéMON to use
STRENGTH in and
out of battle.

Please also take
this with you.


NINTEN received

Bleaah!
I hope ERIKA

I was getting

Grass-type POKéMON
are tough against

They also have an
edge on rock and

Aren't you the

I'm

Oh, you weren't

No!

I'm having a
wonderful time!


Hey!

You have better
things to do,
champ in making!

CELADON GYM's
LEADER is ERIKA!
She uses grass-
type POKéMON!

She might appear
docile, but don't
be fooled!


They offer rare
POKéMON that can
be exchanged for
your coins.

But, I just can't
seem to win!


Games are scary!
It's so easy to
get hooked!


What's up? Want
some coins?


NINTEN received
20 coins!


You have lots of
coins!


Darn! I need more
coins for the
POKéMON I want!


Hey, what? You're
throwing me off!
Here are some
coins, shoo!


NINTEN received
20 coins!


You've got your
own coins!


The trick is to
watch the reels
closely!


I'm guarding this
poster!
Go away, or else!


Dang!


Our hideout might
be discovered! I
better tell BOSS!


Hey!

A switch behind
the poster!?
Let's push it!


Oops! Forgot the
COIN CASE!


POKéMON ability
enhancers can be
bought only here.

Use CALCIUM to
increase SPECIAL
abilities.

Use CARBOS to
increase SPEED.


I'm here for
POKéMON ability
enhancers.

PROTEIN increases
ATTACK power.

IRON increases
DEFENSE!


5F: DRUG STORE


I sure do fancy
that PORYGON!

But, it's hard to
win at slots!


I had a major
haul today!


Hi!

We're taking a
break now.


My POKéMON are
weak, so I often
have to go to the
DRUG STORE.


Psst! There's a
basement under
the GAME CORNER.


Munch...

The man at that
table lost it all
at the slots.


Go ahead! Laugh!

I'm flat out
busted!

No more slots for
me! I'm going
straight!

Here! I won't be
needing this any-
more!


NINTEN received
a {4B}!


Make room for
this!


I always thought
I was going to
win it back...


Hehehe! The slots
just reel in the
dough, big time!


CHIEF!

We just shipped
2000 POKéMON as
slot prizes!


Don't touch the
poster at the
GAME CORNER!

There's no secret
switch behind it!


POKéMON? No, this
is a hotel for
people.

We're full up.


I'm on vacation
with my brother
and boy friend.

CELADON is such a
pretty city!


Why did she bring
her brother?


Do you have a
SAFARI ZONE flag?

What about cards
or calendars?


Did you try X
SPEED? It speeds
up a POKéMON in
battle!


SAFARI ZONE's
WARDEN is old,
but still active!

All his teeth are
false, though.


Hmm? You've met
BILL?

He's my grandson!

He always liked
collecting things
even as a child!


BILL files his
own POKéMON data
on his PC!

Did he show you?


You can't win
with just one
strong POKéMON.

It's tough, but
you have to raise
them evenly.


There's a narrow
trail west of
VIRIDIAN CITY.

It goes to POKéMON
LEAGUE HQ.
The HQ governs
all trainers.


WARDEN: Hif fuff
hefifoo!

Ha lof ha feef ee
hafahi ho. Heff
hee fwee!


Ah howhee ho hoo!
Eef ee hafahi ho!


Ha? He ohay heh
ha hoo ee haheh!


NINTEN gave the
GOLD TEETH to the
WARDEN!


The WARDEN popped
in his teeth!


WARDEN: Thanks,
kid! No one could
understand a word
that I said.

I couldn't work
that way.
Let me give you
something for
your trouble.


NINTEN received
{4B}!


WARDEN: HM04
teaches STRENGTH!

It lets POKéMON
move boulders
when you're out-
side of battle.

Oh yes, did you
find SECRET HOUSE
in SAFARI ZONE?

If you do, you
win an HM!

I hear it's the
rare SURF HM.


Your pack is
stuffed full!


POKéMON photos
and fossils.


Old POKéMON
merchandise.


Welcome to the
SAFARI ZONE!


For just ¥500,
you can catch all
the POKéMON you
want in the park!

Would you like to
join the hunt?


That'll be ¥500
please!

We only use a
special POKé BALL
here.

NINTEN received
30 SAFARI BALLs!


We'll call you on
the PA when you
run out of time
or SAFARI BALLs!


OK! Please come
again!


Oops! Not enough
money!


Leaving early?


Please return any
SAFARI BALLs you
have left.


Good Luck!


Did you get a
good haul?
Come again!


Hi! Is it your
first time here?


SAFARI ZONE has 4
zones in it.

Each zone has
different kinds
of POKéMON. Use
SAFARI BALLs to
catch them!

When you run out
of time or SAFARI
BALLs, it's game
over for you!

Before you go,
open an unused
POKéMON BOX so
there's room for
new POKéMON!


Sorry, you're a
regular here!


KOGA: Fwahahaha!

A mere child like
you dares to
challenge me?

Very well, I
shall show you
true terror as a
ninja master!

You shall feel
the despair of
poison and sleep
techniques!


Humph!
You have proven
your worth!

Here! Take the
SOULBADGE!


When afflicted by
TOXIC, POKéMON
suffer more and
more as battle
progresses!

It will surely
terrorize foes!


Now that you have
the SOULBADGE,
the DEFENSE of
your POKéMON
increases!

It also lets you
SURF outside of
battle!

Ah! Take this
too!


NINTEN received
{4B}!

TM06 contains
TOXIC!

It is a secret
technique over
400 years old!


Make space for
this, child!


Strength isn't
the key for
POKéMON!

It's strategy!

I'll show you how
strategy can beat
brute strength!


What?
Extraordinary!


So, you mix brawn
with brains?
Good strategy!


I wanted to become
a ninja, so I
joined this GYM!


I'm done
for!


I will keep on
training under
KOGA, my ninja
master!


Let's see you
beat my special
techniques!


You
had me fooled!


I like poison and
sleep techniques,
as they linger
after battle!


Stop right there!

Our invisible
walls have you
frustrated?


Whoa!
He's got it!


You impressed me!
Here's a hint!

Look very closely
for gaps in the
invisible walls!


I also study the
way of the ninja
with master KOGA!

Ninja have a long
history of using
animals!


Awoo!


I still have much
to learn!


Master KOGA comes
from a long line
of ninjas!

What did you
descend from?


Dropped
my balls!


Where there is
light, there is
shadow!

Light and shadow!
Which do you
choose?


Yo! Champ in
making!

FUCHSIA GYM is
riddled with
invisible walls!

KOGA might appear
close, but he's
blocked off!

You have to find
gaps in the walls
to reach him!


It's amazing how
ninja can terrify
even now!


We nicknamed the
WARDEN SLOWPOKE.

He and SLOWPOKE
both look vacant!


SLOWPOKE is very
knowledgeable
about POKéMON!

He even has some
fossils of rare,
extinct POKéMON!


SLOWPOKE came in,
but I couldn't
understand him.

I think he's got
a speech problem!


I'm the FISHING
GURU's older
brother!

I simply Looove
fishing!

Do you like to
fish?


Grand! I like
your style!

Take this and
fish, young one!

NINTEN received
a {4B}!


Oh... That's so
disappointing...


Hello there,
NINTEN!

How are the fish
biting?


Oh no!

You have no room
for my gift!


Who are you? There
shouldn't be
anyone here.


Ouch!


A key? I don't
know what you're
talking about.


A secret switch!

Press it?


Who wouldn't?


Not quite yet!


Hah!

I am BLAINE! I
am the LEADER of
CINNABAR GYM!

My fiery POKéMON
will incinerate
all challengers!

Hah! You better
have BURN HEAL!


I have
burnt out!

You have earned
the VOLCANOBADGE!


FIRE BLAST is the
ultimate fire
technique!

Don't waste it on
water POKéMON!


Hah!

The VOLCANOBADGE
heightens the
SPECIAL abilities
of your POKéMON!

Here, you can
have this too!


NINTEN received
{4B}!


TM38 contains
FIRE BLAST!

Teach it to fire-
type POKéMON!

CHARMELEON or
PONYTA would be
good bets!


Make room for my
gift!


Do you know how
hot POKéMON fire
breath can get?


Yow!
Hot, hot, hot!


Fire, or to be
more precise,
combustion...

Blah, blah, blah,
blah...


I was a thief, but
I became straight
as a trainer!


I
surrender!


I can't help
stealing other
people's POKéMON!


You can't win!
I have studied
POKéMON totally!


Waah!
My studies!


My theories are
too complicated
for you!


I just like using
fire POKéMON!


Too hot
to handle!


I wish there was
a thief POKéMON!
I'd use that!


I know why BLAINE
became a trainer!


Ow!


BLAINE was lost
in the mountains
when a fiery bird
POKéMON appeared.

Its light enabled
BLAINE to find
his way down!


I've been to many
GYMs, but this is
my favorite!


Yowza!
Too hot!


Us fire POKéMON
fans like PONYTA
and NINETALES!


Fire is weak
against H2O!


Oh!
Snuffed out!


Water beats fire!
But, fire melts
ice POKéMON!


Yo! Champ in
making!

The hot-headed
BLAINE is a fire
POKéMON pro!

Douse his spirits
with water!

You better take
some BURN HEALs!


NINTEN! You beat
that fire brand!


We study POKéMON
extensively here.

People often bring
us rare POKéMON
for examination.

I found this very
strange fossil in
MT.MOON!

I think it's a
rare, prehistoric
POKéMON!


Tch-tch-tch!
I made a cool TM!

It can cause all
kinds of fun!


NINTEN received
{4B}!


Tch-tch-tch!
That's the sound
of a METRONOME!

It tweaks your
POKéMON's brain
into using moves
it doesn't know!


Your pack is
crammed full!


EEVEE can evolve
into 1 of 3 kinds
of POKéMON.


There's an e-mail
message!

...

The 3 legendary
bird POKéMON are
ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS
and MOLTRES.

Their whereabouts
are unknown.

We plan to explore
the cavern close
to CERULEAN.

An amber pipe!


Hiya!

I am important
doctor!

I study here rare
POKéMON fossils!

You! Have you a
fossil for me?


No! Is too bad!


I take a little
time!

You go for walk a
little while!


Where were you?

Your fossil is
back to life!

It was {4B}
like I think!


Oh! That is
{6D} !

It is fossil of
{4B}, a
POKéMON that is
already extinct!

My Resurrection
Machine will make
that POKéMON live
again!


So! You hurry and
give me that!

NINTEN handed
over {6D}!


I take a little
time!

You go for walk a
little while!


Aiyah! You come
again!


You can cancel
evolution.

When a POKéMON is
evolving, you can
stop it and leave
it the way it is.


Do you have any
friends?

POKéMON you get
in trades grow
very quickly.

I think it's
worth a try!


Don't they have X
ATTACK? It's good
for battles!


It never hurts to
have extra items!


Yo! Champ in
making!

At POKéMON LEAGUE,
you have to face
the ELITE FOUR in
succession.

If you lose, you
have to start all
over again! This
is it! Go for it!


From here on, you
face the ELITE
FOUR one by one!

If you win, a
door opens to the
next trainer!
Good luck!


My daughter is so
self-centered.
She only has a
few friends.


My daughter likes
to mimic people.

Her mimicry has
earned her the
nickname COPYCAT
around here!


CHANSEY: Chaan!
Sii!


NINTEN: Hi! Do
you like POKéMON?

NINTEN: Uh no, I
just asked you.

NINTEN: Huh?
You're strange!

COPYCAT: Hmm?
Quit mimicking?

But, that's my
favorite hobby!


Oh wow!
A POKé DOLL!

For me?
Thank you!

You can have
this, then!


NINTEN received
{4B}!

TM31 contains my
favorite, MIMIC!

Use it on a good
POKéMON!


NINTEN: Hi!
Thanks for TM31!

NINTEN: Pardon?

NINTEN: Is it

my every move?

COPYCAT: You bet!
It's a scream!


Don't you want
this?

Huh? Can't see!


Grunt!

I am the KARATE
MASTER! I am the
LEADER here!

You wish to
challenge us?
Expect no mercy!

Fwaaa!


Hwa!
Arrgh! Beaten!


Indeed, I have
lost!

But, I beseech
you, do not take
our emblem as
your trophy!

In return, I will
give you a prized
fighting POKéMON!

Choose whichever
one you like!


Ho!

Stay and train at
Karate with us!


Hoargh! Take your
shoes off!


I give
up!


You wait 'til you
see our Master!

I'm a small fry
compared to him!


I hear you're
good! Show me!


Judge!
1 point!


Our Master is a
pro fighter!


Nothing tough
frightens me!

I break boulders
for training!


Yow!
Stubbed fingers!


The only thing
that frightens us
is psychic power!


Hoohah!

You're trespassing
in our FIGHTING
DOJO!


Oof!
I give up!


The prime fighters
across the land
train here.


You want the
hard kicking
HITMONLEE?


You want the
piston punching
HITMONCHAN?


Better not get
greedy...


I had a vision of
your arrival!

I have had psychic
powers since I
was a child.

I first learned
to bend spoons
with my mind.

I dislike fight-
ing, but if you
wish, I will show
you my powers!


I'm
shocked!
But, a loss is a
loss.

I admit I didn't
work hard enough
to win!

You earned the
MARSHBADGE!


Everyone has
psychic power!
People just don't
realize it!


The MARSHBADGE
makes POKéMON up
to L70 obey you!

Stronger POKéMON
will become wild,
ignoring your
orders in battle!

Just don't raise
your POKéMON too
much!

Wait, please take
this TM with you!


NINTEN received
TM46!


TM46 is PSYWAVE!
It uses powerful
psychic waves to
inflict damage!


Your pack is full
of other items!


Yo! Champ in
making!

SABRINA's POKéMON
use psychic power
instead of force!

Fighting POKéMON
are weak against
psychic POKéMON!

They get creamed
before they can
even aim a punch!


Psychic power,
huh?

If I had that,
I'd make a bundle
at the slots!


SABRINA is younger
than I, but I
respect her!


Not
good enough!


In a battle of
equals, the one
with the stronger
will wins!

If you wish
to beat SABRINA,
focus on winning!


Does our unseen
power scare you?


I never
foresaw this!


Psychic POKéMON
fear only ghosts
and bugs!


POKéMON take on
the appearance of
their trainers.

Your POKéMON must
be tough, then!


I knew
it!


I must teach
better techniques
to my POKéMON!


You know that
power alone isn't
enough!


I don't
believe this!


SABRINA just wiped
out the KARATE
MASTER next door!


You and I, our
POKéMON shall
fight!


I lost
after all!


I knew that this
was going to take
place.


SABRINA is young,
but she's also
our LEADER!

You won't reach
her easily!


I lost
my concentration!


There used to be
2 POKéMON GYMs in
SAFFRON.

The FIGHTING DOJO
next door lost
its GYM status
when we went and
creamed them!


SAFFRON POKéMON
GYM is famous for
its psychics!

You want to see
SABRINA!
I can tell!


Arrrgh!


That's right! I
used telepathy to
read your mind!


Thank you for
writing. I hope
to see you soon!

Hey! Don't look
at my letter!


PIDGEY: Kurukkoo!


The COPYCAT is
cute! I'm getting
her a POKé DOLL!


I was given a PP
UP as a gift.

It's used for
increasing the PP
of techniques!


MAX REPEL lasts

it wanders around
sowing its seeds.


The fluid that
oozes from its
mouth isn't drool.

It is a nectar
that is used to
attract prey.


The larger its
petals, the more
toxic pollen it

contains. Its big
head is heavy and
hard to hold up.


A carnivorous
POKéMON that traps
and eats bugs.

It uses its root
feet to soak up
needed moisture.


It spits out
POISONPOWDER to
immobilize the

enemy and then
finishes it with
a spray of ACID.


Said to live in
huge colonies
deep in jungles,

although no one
has ever returned
from there.
