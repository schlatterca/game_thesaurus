Corneria, fourth planet of the Lylat
system. The evil Andross turned this
once thriving system into a wasteland
of near extinction.
 
General Pepper of the Cornerian army
was successful in exiling this
maniacal scientist to the barren,
deserted planet Venom.
 
Five years later, General Pepper
noticed strange activity coming from
Venom. James McCloud, Pigma Dengar
and Peppy Hare of the Star Fox team
were sent to investigate. Upon their
arrival, Pigma betrayed the team and
James and Peppy were captured by
Andross.
 
Peppy barely escaped Venom and
returned home to tell James' son Fox
about his father's fate.
 
A few years have passed. Andross has
again invaded the Lylat system.
General Pepper has turned to a new
Star Fox team headed by Fox McCloud
to save Corneria and free the Lylat
system once again.

Message from 
General Pepper.
Priority one!

We need your help,
Star Fox!
 
Andross has declared
war!
 
He's invaded the
Lylat system
 
and is trying to
take over Corneria!
 
Our army alone
can't do the job!
Hurry, Star Fox!

It's about time you
showed up, Fox.
You're the only hope
for our world!

I'll do my best!
Andross won't have
his way with me!

Impressive, Star Fox! 
Now watch out for 
enemies in the 
asteroid field.

I won't let you down,
sir.

What are you doing?
It's too dangerous
there!

I can't leave Slippy
hangin'!

Reports indicate
that Andross is
working on some
secret weapon.

I'll check it out.

Recover our base from
the enemy army!

Roger, General.

If you destroy the
satellite, we can go
straight for Venom!
Be careful, Fox!

I'm on it!

It's almost over!
We're in your debt.
Come back in one
piece, Fox!

Will do, General!

So you're going to 
attack the enemy 
base? Great idea, 
Fox!

It'll be a piece of
cake, General!

Katina is battling
the enemy. Will you
help 'em out?

Affirmative, General.

Star Fox, I want you
to take out the
enemy bio-weapon!

Yes, sir. Deploy the
Blue-Marine!

There's an enemy base
there?!

Affirmative, General.

The enemy army is
gunning for you.
Be careful!

Don't worry, sir!

Fox, we're under
attack! Help us
out here!

I'm on my way!

That area's an oven!
Don't go burning that
Arwing! Be
reasonable, Fox!

I'll be careful.

 Open the wings.

 Check your 
G-Diffuser system!

 Falco here. 
I'm fine.

 This is Peppy. 
All systems go.

 Slippy here. 
I'm OK.

 I see 'em up ahead!
Let's rock and roll!

 We're entering
Corneria City now!

 This is horrible...

 Slippy, watch out! 
Bogey on your tail!

 Whoa! Help me!

 Don't be doing
anything foolish!

 Gotcha!

 Back off, Fox!

 Do a barrel roll 
(Z or R twice)!

 You've got an enemy 
on your tail!

 Use the brake
(press the C 
Button)!

 Follow your 
father's example, 
Fox!

 I'll take this one.
Get the one behind
me!

 I could use some 
help here, Fox!

 Something's wrong
with the G-Diffuser!

 Pretty smooth 
flying, Fox.

 Follow me, Fox!

 Falco, where ya 
going?

 I found the target!
Try to keep up.

 Enemy robot
dead ahead.

 Let's go!

 You annoying 
little flies!

 Enemy shield
analyzed.

 Aim for his back!

 Move it, Fox! He's
right behind you!

 Quit screwing
around! Do
something!

 Ah, so this is
Star Fox?

 I'm going to crush
you!

 Those who cross
Andross will die!

 Stop moving so I 
can squash you!

 You are starting 
to annoy me.

 No!!!

 I will not be
defeated by this
worm!

 My emperor...
I've failed you!

 Ah..someone
wants to play!

 Deploy all units!
CHARGE!!!

 I've got a present
for ya!

 Go!!

 Who are you guys?

 We're Star Fox!

 You'll never 
defeat Andross!

 Incoming enemy 
from the rear!
Drop altitude!

 Aim for the open
spot!

 You did it! I was
worried for a 
moment.

 There ya go!

 You're becoming
more like your
father.

 I'm fine. You OK 
over there, Fox?

 We're heading out. 
All aircraft report!

 Thanks, Fox! I
thought they had me!

 I guess I should 
be thankful.

 Things are starting 
to heat up!

 Quit dinkin'
around, Slip!

 We're headin' into
the asteroids.

 Here comes a BIG
one!

 It's quiet.
Too quiet.

 Be careful!
It's a trap!

 Just shoot it, Fox!

 Don't mess up
that Arwing!

 Whoa! Can you 
make it?

 The enemy's coming
from behind.

 I guess it's your
turn to be thankful.

 You want a piece
of me?!

 Take that!

 I cannot allow you
to go any further.

 Let's see what 
you've got.

 That shield is
absorbing the 
laser!

 I've underestimated
you.

 How about this?

 I'm no match
for you.

 I admit defeat.

 Are you gonna
listen to that
monkey?

 Ha ha! You're not 
as stupid as you 
look!

 If this does 
not work...

 Sorry to jet, but
I'm in a hurry!

 I can't believe I
lost to this scum!!

 You're more
cunning than I
thought.

 Give me Slippy's
location, ROB.

 Life form indicated
at 12 o'clock.

 There's rocky 
terrain dead ahead!

 A magnetic storm!
We'll search here.

 I think you look
better in a tank.

 He can sure be
a pain in the neck.

 Why don't you come
down here, Falco?

 I'll pass, Fox.

 Don't go too fast,
Falco.

 Try hovering
(Z and R).

 Enemy fighters
comin' at you, Fox.

 Are you OK?

 Don't be dead, Slip.

 Incoming!

 You OK? Hold
together. Just a
bit further.

 Is that you,
Slippy?

 I'll be there soon.

 Go for the chest!

 Data analysis
complete. Here
it comes.

 Do something!

 Let me get a piece
of that action, 
Fox!

 Take out his 
arms, Fox.

 Pipe down, Slippy!
Just hold on.

 Slippy, what are you
doing? Hurry up!

 It's impossible 
this way!

 Sure you can
handle it, Fox?

 I thought I was a
goner!

 We're always savin'
your hide, Slip.

 I'm sure he's 
learned his lesson.

 When we get back,
we'll head to Venom.

 I made it! I'll
analyze right away.

 Fox!!!!

 I knew you'd
come help me!

 Deploy the
Landmaster!

 Let's take out that 
weapon, boys.

 Let's have a 
little fun!

 Enemy group
behind us. Man
they're fast!

 Something's
not right.

 We're gettin'
close to the base.

 Somebody beat us
here. It's all gone!

 What the heck 
is that?!

 I got tagged. My
ears are still 
ringing.

 Thanks, Fox.

 I can't wait to see 
this secret weapon!

 I found the gate.
Looks like a warp.

 I'm gonna open the
gate. Back me up!

 Bill! You're OK!

 Of course! 
I'm here to help.

 Take it easy, Fox.
Don't let us down.

 Something's not
right here.

 Who took this base
out?

 Hurry up or you're
toast!

 I'll attack from 
the outside.

 Interceptor system
dead ahead.

 They're everywhere!

 Where is the 
secret weapon?

 I'm going ahead. 
Back me up, Fox.

 What the heck? Fox,
look behind you!

 So this is the 
secret weapon.

 Destroy what?
He's crazy.

 Let me handle this.

 Destroy.
Destroy.

 I will terminate
all enemies.

 You are an enemy.

 Where is the 
creator?!

 What's he saying?

 The view is clear.

 Where is the enemy?

 I must be complete.

 ROB, can you 
confirm Slippy's
location?

 Looks like he's
on Titania.

 Slippy can be such
a headache.

 Distress signal
coming from Titania.

 YEAH! 
Just one more.

 Slippy! Is 
everything OK?

 Yeah yeah.
No problem.

 Let's sneak in low
and surprise them!

 THIS is Zoness?

 What a dump!

 I can't believe 
they did this!

 I hear ya, Slippy.

 Watch out for the
search light!

 Let's take 'em 
all out!

 Uh oh. Have we
been spotted?

 We're closing in
on them, Falco!

 Katt?! What are
you doing here?

 Is that any way
to greet a girl?

 Here I go!

 Take the right 
light, boy. I have
the left.

 Enemy tanker!

 Aim for the 
rudder, Fox!

 I've got somebody
on my tail!

 Mess with me and
you'll get 
scratched!

 Enemy fighters
spotted! Take 'em 
down!

 These guys 
don't quit!

 Shoot!

 Whoa! Watch out!

 Be careful!
It might be a trap!

 Something's coming
from the sea!

 Ar ha ha ha har!

 Disrespectful
little whelps!

 I'll teach ye some
respect!

 All sections ready.
Engage!

 Prepare to surface!

 Adjust 10 degrees
right! FIRE!

 Pressure, angle OK.
Fire torpedo!

 Aaargh! 
Drop the crane now!

 I can't see 
anything...
Fire anyway!

 Fire! Fire!

 Arrggghhh!!!

 His armor is tough!
Use bombs wisely!

 Destroy the two
exhaust pipes!

 Quick, destroy the
crane!

 Oh SHOOT!!

 Looks like we're
headin' for Macbeth.

 Katt, where'd you 
go?

 Caiman here.
No problems.

 Do you copy?
Emergency
maneuvers!

 Too late! 
Game over, pal!

 Entering Venom air
defense zone.

 Everybody stay
alert!

 Space mines ahead!

 Hold still and let
me shoot you!

 We're gonna break
through that fleet.

 Incoming enemy
missile!

 Shoot 'em down!
We're being marked!

 Did we get 'em?

 Not yet, sir!

 Great Fox will
cover you.

 Enemy ahead. This
one's different.

 Crud! We were SO
close to Venom.

 Bogey behind me. 
Am I gettin' slow?

 They're on me! I'm
gettin' careless!

 Venom's right there!

 Shoot the tentacles 
to open the core!

 Destroy all three
energy balls.

 YEAH! 
It's working!

 Yeah! Yeah!

 The shield is gone!
Shoot the core!

 Hold on! We're
entering Venom
air space.

 Fire! Fire!
Don't let them
through!

 They've broken
through the first 
line!

 They're through
the second line!

 These guys are
crazy!

 Dang! DEPLOY
IT NOW!

 The last line has
been breached!

 All right!

 Don't relax. We're
not done yet.

 Time to show the
monkeys who's boss!

 This brings back
memories of your 
dad.

 You'll be sorry, 
punks!

 These guys just
keep coming.

 Don't go dyin'
on me!

 I'll take the left.

 I've got the right.

 I'm beaten up
pretty bad.

 Jeez Laweez!
What is that?!

 That temple gives
me the creeps.

 What's going on?
He's runnin' away!

 Stay alert!

 Don't get too 
close, Fox!!

 It's all comin'
down to this.

 I've got a BAD
feeling about this, 
Fox.

 I'll go it alone
from here.

 Fox!!

 Fox!!

 Fox!!

 I've been waiting
for you, Star Fox.

 You know that I
control the galaxy.

 It's foolish to 
come against me.

 You will die just
like your father.

 Fox!! 
Are you OK?

 YES!! 
You did it!!

 OK, I'll admit it.
You did good, Fox.

 Split up and take
it to em!

 Why are ships
coming out of the
base?

 Shoot! He's right
behind me!

 Fox, get this guy
off me!

 Take care of the
guy behind me, 
Fox!

 I can't shake 
this guy!

 This is really
starting to tick
me off!

 What's taking you
so long, Fox?

 Dang, I'm hit!

 Ahhh!! I'm hit!

 Shoot! 
They got me!

 Gee, I've been 
saved by Fox.
How swell.

 Hoo! That was
TOO close.

 Your father helped
me like that, too.

 Time for a little 
payback!

 You're not gettin'
away that easy!

 I won't let you get
away from me!

 You're dead
meat, pal!

 I've got you now!

 You're mine!

 Scratch one bogey!

 I got one!

 There's one down!

 Can't let you do 
that, Star Fox!

 Andross has ordered
us to take you down.

 We're gettin' paid
a lot of cash for 
this.

 Peppy! Long time
no see!

 Andross' enemy is
my enemy.

 Just what I need 
to see. Star Wolf.

 You'll be seeing
your dad soon, 
Fox!

 You're in my 
sights! You're
going down!

 You're not as tough
as I thought.

 That reward's as
good as mine!

 Bow before the
great Andross!

 You're not so tough!

 Annoying bird! 
I am the great Leon!

 I'll do you fast,
Peppy old pal.

 Stick to the pond,
Froggie.

 I will not be
defeated by this 
trash!

 Shoot me down
if you can!

 Come on, little man!
Shoot me!

 I'm not afraid of 
YOU!

 I...can't...lose!

 This can't be
happening!

 My beautiful reward!
Aaarrrggghhh!

 Uncle Andross!

 What the heck?!

 A bomb has been
planted at the base.

 Geez! Can anyone
take care of it?

 Let's take care of
these guys first.

 Danger. One minute
to explosion.

 30 seconds to
explosion.

 15 seconds to
explosion.

 Bomb exploding.
Keep clear.

 I'll take care of
the bomb now.

 Emergency
maneuvers! 
Get out of there!

 They almost got us!

 I'm not too crazy
about those guys.

 So that's Star Wolf?

 Hey, we made it!

 Fox, take it easy!

 That was a close
call, Fox!

 Looks like we win
today, Star Fox.

 Close, but no cigar!
HA HA!

 I've got two words
for you: LO-SER!!!

 Score one for 
Andross!

 I got the last one!

 I got the last one!

 I got the last one!

 Keep an eye on your 
shield gauge.

 The Arwing might
not make it!

 Brace yourselves!

 Shoot the rocks!

 This baby can take
temperatures up to
9000 degrees.

 Temperature is
6000 and climbing!

 It's now at 8000! 
Oh no!

 Looks like you 
could use some
help, Fox.

 Bill?!

 Don't get too
excited. Here we go!

 Watch yourself,
Fox...

 They're attacking 
in groups!

 THIS is the enemy's
bio-weapon?!

 Andross is an
insane fool!

 Maybe it's an arm.
Aim for the arm!

 I ain't your buddy!
Go away!

 Good riddance. I
almost got burned!

 It's too hot! I 
can't take it
anymore!

 Don't fly too low!
Your ship can't 
take it!

 OK guys, destroy
all barriers.

 Aim for the six
energy towers.

 I'll cover you, 
Fox.

 Your carcass is
mine!

 Hey! The force 
field is 
disappearing!

 Looks like we've
got company.

 Play time is over,
Star Fox!

 I think I'll 
torture you for 
awhile!

 Daddy screamed
REAL good before
he died!

 You'll be sorry
you crossed us!

 Good. I see the
enemy core.

 Destroy the
satellite's core!

 Venom, here we come.

 Those ships are
shielded, too!

 You are NOT taking
him down today.

 What's taking so 
long, Fox?

 They don't give up.

 Star Wolf again?!
Why now?

 Let's back up
the squadron.

 Somebody's gonna
pay for all this.

 Don't let any of
'em through!

 Something's wrong.
I don't see 
anything.

 Hold 'em! They're
trying to get 
through!

 Fox, you're 
supposed to
shoot 'em all!

 Good job! 
Keep up the pace!

 Is that the best
you can do?

 You're becoming a
better pilot.

 Surprise attack
coming from above!

 I'll take care of
everything below.

 I've got everything
above.

 Ah ha! Thought you
could hide from me, 
eh?

 Escaping? I don't
think so!

 Hey! 
Leave me alone!

 Take 'em down with 
one shot!

 He's quick! 
Be careful.

 Something's up
ahead. Looks
different.

 Geez, quit moving
around!

 Watch the radar
carefully, Fox.

 These guys are
tough!

 Good job. Keep up
the good work.

 Don't party just 
yet.

 It's time to try
our new weapon.

 What's wrong?
Is that it?

 I'm comin' for ya!

 I'll take you guys
out from the ship!

 Cocky little freaks!

 Aaaaahhhhh!!!!

 We're headin' for
Aquas. Report in.

 I'm gonna check out 
the bio-weapon.

 I'm sending the 
data to you guys.

 Looks like the
pollution has 
started.

 It's awful...

 How's the
Blue-Marine, Fox?

 It's a good thing
you prepared, Slip.

 This thing will 
never hold together.

 Keep shooting.
We've got lots of 
torpedoes!

 You're the best,
Slippy!

 Thanks, Peppy!

 I've found the
bio-weapon.

 Aim for the two
columns.

 Fire a homing
torpedo!

 That's it, Fox.

 Go for the eyes!

 We're preparing
to dock.

 Slippy's not such a
screw up after all.

 Thanks a lot, Peppy!

 I'll take the sky 
any day.

 Sheesh, Falco!
You, too?

 Shoot a torpedo to 
help you see.

 Wow! Look at that!
It's beautiful!

 Yippee! 
You did it!

 Thanks, Slip.
Blue-Marine
came through.

Enemy behind.
Descend!

 Enemy approaching
from the left.

 We'll gladly take
this one.

 Nice welcome!

 I'm heading for the
missile now.

 I'm going for the
missile.

 I'm heading for the 
missile now.

 Six missiles coming
from the left.

 Missile one is
heading for
Great Fox.

 Here it comes!

 Missile approaching.
Distance 50.

 Missile approaching.
Distance 20.

 Distance 10.
Unable to evade.

 Missiles 2 and 3
approaching!

 Missiles 4, 5 and 6 
approaching!

 Are you gonna hog
all the fun?

 Katt?! Can't you go
bother someone else?

 Let me help you out.

 Make way for Katt!

 Beautiful! I could 
kiss you for that!

 You owe me, Falco.

 You're on your own.
Good luck, little 
man.

 Too bad, little man.

 One missile down.

 One missile 
destroyed.

 Scratch one missile.

 I took care of a
missile for ya.
 
 ROB, is
everything OK?

 Damage to rear left
section of the ship.

 Dang, now they've
done it!

 It could be
difficult to attack
Venom.

 Doggone it!

 Great Fox is OK.

 That was a close 
call.

 We've got the bad
guys on the run.

 Don't worry.
Slippy's here!

 I spot the train.
I'm takin' it out!

 Hey, I've got my
hands full up here.

 Don't let 'em get
to the supply depot!

 I see the fuel 
bunker on the 
right side.

 Change the switch
ahead.

 Shoot the 8 
switches to open
the lock.

 Startin' without
me? Boys, I'm
crushed.

 Katt?! 
Not you again.

 I've got the left.
You take the right, 
hon.

 OK! Now shoot
the switcher.

 Good going, Fox.

 Well, at least we
can take this boss 
out.

 You're pretty good,
tiger. See you 
again!

 I'm sure we hurt
'em this time.

 Now it's our turn
to kick some tail!

 I can see the look
on their stupid 
faces!

 I'm outta here. 
Take care, Falco.

 Here come the 
little hyenas, now!

 Dang! Detach the
rear vehicle.

 What's wrong? Come
a little closer!

 Here ya go!

 They're not taking
me seriously.

 I'll lure these 
guys to the front.

 I didn't expect to
have to use this!

 You're very lucky.

 Gwaaa!!!

 No!!
Get away!!

 Heh heh heh...
what's wrong?

 Try this!

 NO! 
Hit the brakes!!!

 I can't STOP IT!

 Step on the gas!

 How's the 
Landmaster, Fox?

 You're too slow.
Time to end this!

 Take this!

 Hang on, guys.
Help is on the way!

 Fox! You made it!

 Bill?! Is that you?
I can't believe it!

 We can catch up
later, Fox.

 Hard to tell the
good guys from the 
bad!

 Try shooting the
bad guys, Fox.

 Fox, that's one of 
ours!

 Husky unit,
cover the base!

 Bulldog unit, don't 
let anything 
through!

 All units report!

 Man, there's just 
no end to these 
guys!

 Enemy mothership
approaching.

 You've become quite 
a pilot.

 Here they come!

 Go for the 4 
hatches on the 
underside!

 The hatches are
open!

 There's some sort
of energy reaction!

 The core has 
appeared! Stand by 
to attack!

 Hurry up and take 
out that core!

 There's not much 
time left! Hurry!

 Yee haaaa!
You did it!

 Fox, get out of 
here NOW!

 ...All aircraft,
break away!

 Dang........

 Don't get so down, 
Fox.

 Take care, Fox.

 You, too....Bill.

 I'm glad we're on 
the same team, Fox.

 You owe me one.

 Just like old times,
eh Fox?

 Stick around for 
awhile.

 Here's something 
for ya, Fox.

 Enemy down....
Wait, that was one
of ours!

 Say your prayers,
Andross!

 Huh? What?!

 Don't get too cocky, 
Star Fox!

 Let's see how you
handle our new 
ships!

 Too bad dad's not 
here to see ya FAIL!

 We'll make sure
you never reach 
Andross!

 We'll just see 
about that,
Star Wolf.

 You guys don't
give up.

 Now you will feel 
TRUE pain!

 Only I have the 
brains to rule 
Lylat!

 If I go down, I'm 
taking you with me!

 Follow me, Fox.

 Father?!

 This way, Fox.

 Never give up.
Trust your
instincts.

 You've become so
strong, Fox.

 Fox! You're OK!

 Way to go, Fox!

 That's our leader!

 What's wrong, Fox?

 Nothing...
Nothing's wrong.

 What?! Is that all 
you got?

 I'll take care of 
you!

 I'm gonna bust you 
up REAL good!

 You're not welcome 
here!

 You're good, but 
I'm better.

 Not yet. The
party's just begun!

 You can't beat me. 
I've got a better 
ship!

 Give it up.
You can't win!

 No way! 
I don't believe it!

 He's too strong!

 This can't be
happening!

 Ahhhh!!!!

 I see you've got 
new ships.

 Hey, nice aircraft, 
guys!

 I can't break free!

 There's one more 
to go.

 So, Andross, you 
show your true form!

 Hurry, Fox. 
I'm waiting for you.

 Don't ever give up, 
my son.

 All aircraft report!

 I'm fine, I'm fine!

 Everything's A-OK.

 I'm havin' some
trouble here!

 I've taken a few 
hits, but I'm OK.

 I thought I was a
goner.

 I saw my life flash
before my eyes!

 Ah, you're getting
better, Fox.

 You are SO 
lucky, Fox.

 You worry about 
your own hide.

 Are you OK?

 Shoot! I've taken 
damage!

 Dang! I'm hit!

 Slippy's hit!

 Hey, Einstein! 
I'm on your side!

 Knock it off, Fox!

 Hey! 
What's the big idea?

 You tryin' to 
damage my pretty 
face?!

 Hey! See if I help 
you again!

 No!!!!

 No!!!!

 No!!!!

 Hey! He was mine!

 What's the big 
idea, Fox?

 Go find your own 
target, Fox!

 All-range mode.

 What do you think
you're doing, Fox?

 Watch where you're 
flying!

 Get out of my way!

 Oh man! I'm gonna 
have to back off.

 Sorry, guys, I've 
gotta sit this one 
out.

 I'm monkey food if
I don't leave!

 Your skills have

 I guess you're good
for something.

 Great, Fox!

 Peppy!

 Falco!

 Slippy!

 Slippy, get back

 Heh heh..

 Ah, the son of

 I'll make those

 Those tin cans are
